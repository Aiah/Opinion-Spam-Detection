"While looking for a nice brunch Sunday brunch spot, we decided to visit Sprout. ?No place on their web page did it state that children under 10 were not welcome. ?My kids, 5 and 9, are very accustomed to eating in nice restaurants. ?My husband and I will not be visiting this establishment again--by ourselves OR when the kids come of age."
I like this place a lot. ��My buddy lives near by there so its a great place to get a bite to eat before you go out. ��Try their ultimate grilled cheese sandwich (with tomato and bacon YUM!).
"If I could give 3.5 stars I would. ��I don't know if this restaurant is owned by the same people who run the India house in Oak Brook but this is clearly the inferior of the two. ��The weekend lunch buffet is $16.95+ drinks in Chicago and about $10.95 with drink in Oak Brook. ��Considering the Oak Brook location is far superior in not only selection, (double the buffet size/specifically Lamb choices) but in quality I do not think the %54 mark up to eat in River North is justified. ��I suppose this can be explained by the fact that the Western Suburbs are home to thousands of Indians and Oak Brook has numerous Indian restaurants and the competition drives down prices. ��River North on the other hand is full of tourists and rich yuppies most of whom are not Indian. ��Moreover, India House is the o"
"This restaurant is the best! ��I always go there when I get a taste for the Greek cuisine.I absolutely love this restaurant. ��My favorite appetizer is the hot lima beans, which is so perfect. ��Everything on the menu is excellent!"
"Great staff! ��Delicious food and beer! ��Nice atmosphere! ��Some decently priced stuff on the menu, and food quality is excellent. ��Will definitely be back."
"I'm not sure what to make of this place. ��It's like they had a marketing meeting at the Panda Express & said, ""We need to come up with a hip Asian concept! ��Stat!"" ��The food is that mediocre and the atmosphere is that cheesey. ��Cue the obnoxious techno muzack, and play it LOUD! ��The people eating there literally look like a nightclub scene in a bad cliche movie, they are dressed so ridicuously that you wonder if they even have mirrors at home, or if they are just the victims of a casting agent with a sick sense of humor. ��And it would be easier to ignore if not for the fact that the tables in there are so jammed packed together that every 2 seconds you're getting elbowed in the nuts by a Paris Hilton/Brody Jenner wannabee or a wayward busboy. ��Un-friggin-comfortable. Which is only made wor"
Such good food. The service is really great for not being a fancy restaurant and whatnot. haha Been back there many of times and will be in the future.
Yummy! ��This is the place I take all my guests when they come to my apartment in Albany Park.Love this place. ��Food is good. ��Even the simple pita brad or the side dill rice are amazing.Try their Persian Gelatto.... Chocolate Hazelnut! ��Grape! Fig! Nom nom.Service is very good.
"I have been going to the Diner pretty regularly since 1992 and obviously the menu and staff (management) have changed over the years. ��The food is good but not always great, but what can you expect from a diner? ��It is not pretending to be a four-star restaurant or anything! ��Since I've been hardcore vegan for many, many years it is great to go somewhere where I can actually eat about 90% of the food on the menu -- as opposed to less than 10% at most places. ��I especially love their deserts (e.g., chocolate chip tofu cheesecake), but I won't stay too long to eat when it gets too noisy in there ... okay, okay, it IS a diner ... so I guess I won't complain too much ..."
Just ordered our first delivery pizza thru FoGo and their delivery service - it was terrible - 45 minutes late and completely cold. ��Had to contact http://zuppler.com (delivery service) and were told that they had to contact restaurant to get it redelivered. ��It's like paying for delivery and getting a frozen pizza. ��NEVER AGAIN - we learned our lesson.
"Today I came here w/ my family. First we started out with an appetizer of fried zucchini, which wasn't even fried, and was just ok. We then waited almost 45 minutes for our pizzas. However, the pizzas were worth waiting for. They were amazing. We got two pizzas: a margherita and an arugula pizza, which were both amazing. For desert, we got a type of chocolate ball with cocoa powder, which was very good, and because of the wait, the manager brought us a nutela crepe. It was to DIE for. It was rich and creamy, on of the best deserts I have ever eaten. Overall, great restaurant."
I really like this place. Try a different dish everytime you come
The food was very normal. Nothing exciting. The Dessert - Kulfi ice cream that I ordered was terrible. When I was using a $50 gift card that I got from my sister to pay my bill of $65 they refused to accept it. Not a coupon or groupon but a gift card. My sister got this gift card in December 2009 and the excuse the manager of India house made was that the gift card expires in 1 year even when it did not say anywhere on the gift card. He also said that you can try using it in a different India house restaurant even when it clearly says on the gift card that it is valid for this location. I was a disappointing experience overall. Never going back there again.
Amen about the ketchup !!! Ewww...Heinz girl for sure...but other than that burgers and service were great.
"It's a 5 star rest. so I suppose 5 should be average but if I could, I would eat here every day of the week (until I got tired of it ... which might take a while)."
"Hi,My husband and I have been to Davanti several times and the food has always been good, but last night not so good. Our waiter Martha was very corgial at first, when we sat down, then once our ordered was placed, poof, like a ghost she was gone.Always had to ask the bus boy to get her for us, as far as the food all was good except the pizza was terrible, very dry and they did remove it from the check.We have had pizza's there in the past, and were very good. I also ordered the mortadella pasta, was to be in a brown butter sage, which it was, but Martha failed to mention also balsamic vinegar, didn't like the sweetness on the pasta.Didn't have the experience there we have had in the past!"
"We dined at the restaurant on April 30 for an early dinner and found the experience pretty underwhelming compared to our other dynamite eating experiences in Chicago.From the start, it was pretty obvious we were going to be rushed through in order to free up the table for a later reservation. We were encouraged to order quickly and all of our food arrived so fast it couldn't have been prepared to order. One quick note about the ambience. It's very dark and the music is incredibly loud and overbearing, to the point of not being able to hear the server speak. We asked if it was possible for the music to be turned down, but were told the chef sets the level and it couldn't be altered.On to the food. The deconstructed Caesar was artistic and good, but the plate was too chilled and it had obvio"
"Best sushi in Chicago! ��Everytime I dine at SUNDA the customer service blows me away, but last week in particular really blew me out of the water. ��I had called earlier in the afternoon around 1PM, hoping to make a reservation for two in the dining room, unfortunately the dining room was fully commited so the hostess reserved us a spot in the lounge. ��I know reservations are hard to come by, expecially on a Friday night, so I was ecstatic to have a seat regardless. ��Much to my excitment ��later in the evening received a phone call from Carla, one of the hostesses who informed me that she was able to find me a seat in the dining room because of a cancellation. ��She couldnt have been ��friendlier on the phone and when I arrived treated me as though I was the only one in the restraunt. ��Once se"
"The lamb is my favorite, I would go back for it.And there's this cheese with fire on top, it's special, should try it !But be careful, the free refill stuff is free refill for one cup."
"Good steak burritos! The salsa and chips are good too. Try the desserts, their delicious."
"4 words...milk braised pork shoulder. I literally have dreams about it every night. Order it....no actually, order three because I guarantee you will not want to share it with anyone and you will want leftovers to last you through the week...It's just simply delicious upon all levels. Incredibly tender and flavorful!"
I am middle eastern and let me tell you the food here is horrible. You want some good middle eastern food I will be happy to make it for you for free just to prove my point!
"My girlfriend kept hearing great things, and it's near where she lives, so I said OK. ��I'm not impressed. The entrees all hovered around $20, and salads around $10. The insalata cippolina e pomodoro was good, but my entree was less than OK. I ordered the tenderloin brasciole, which is traditionally layers of stuff rolled up in beef and braised. This was to served over a pile of BOXED PASTA. I am not convinced that their pasta is homemade as claimed. This rigatoni looked just like a box of Prince brand dried box pasta. Also, the brasciole was a waste of tenderloin. It was a dried out thin layer of meat filled with grated parmesan(nearly undetectable, redolent of raw minced garlic (YUK!) and flat leaf parsley. The server seemed aloof, the bus boy seemed in a rush to clear my empty salad plat"
Food...Great!Atmosphere..Great!Service..Needs to be more attentive unless you do not mind bus boys doing everything.Music...80's prom music needs to go..felt like cougars trying to relive happier times.
"Piece is fantastic! I'm with Check Please... I had the red pizza with spinach, roasted red peppers, and garlic - and the spinach was totally fresh! And yummy! And scrumptious! (Reviewer Anne W. and her finace must have gotten a little side tracked with all that canoodling and let their pizza sit out for too long...) Piece's staff is super hip and attentive. I always feel welcomed, and leave full and happy."
"Yum! A bit pricey, but really good. I love the veggie croissant - tasty and somewhat healthy. ��Beware though, the soda is completely flat."
"My boyfriend and I went to Bonsoiree a couple nights ago to celebrate our anniversary. ��We were so excited to go here based on all the great reviews we had read. ��Unfortunately, the disappointment began right away. ��We were seated at a table by the bathrooms and kitchen. Needless to say, we had to yell over clanging dishes to have a conversation.But, we went with it, and ordered the four course menu. ��The first course was a warm salad of grilled frissee. ��The salad was fine. ��Kind of boring, but it was alrightThe next course was squash bisque with a medley of cauliflower. ��This soup was actually okay. ��It was the highlight of our gross dinner.The main course was a lamb loin chop. ��This was really where the meal went south. ��The lamb was completely disgusting. ��It was all fat! ��I was able t"
"My wife and I love this place! The food is delicious, the salad bar is remarkable, and the service is always good. The selection of meats is fabulous, except for the unfortunate waiter who comes with the sausage, which I tend to refuse.It can be a bit pricey, but the atmosphere is awesome, the place tends to stay quiet, and is a good place for a date.Compared to Fogo de Chao, I prefer Texas de Brazil; however, I've never been to Brazza's.They take reservations so take advantage and call ahead of time to guarantee seating; I never go without calling ahead of time.For parking, if you're willing to pay, they provide valet parking. Otherwise, if you take Ohio and get there about 6:00, street parking starts from 6:00/6:30 depending on the night. We always get there around that time and we've ne"
"Alinea is the best restaurant I have ever enjoyed.service great, food amazing. Dinner wasn't cheap but was worth every penny. Most highly recommended."
"I had my birthday party here in February and it was wonderful! The service is always stellar and the food is spot on. No corkage fee is definitely a highlight...and no cake cutting fee! Fabulous!I also went there for another birthday party this past weekend. We had a group of 20 - the servers and owner was hardcore attentive and everything was great. They sure do know how to work a room and flip tables boy. Wow! Well, the avocado cream cheese won-tons are AMAZING! They make both meat eaters and veggies not even miss crab! Yum!I love this place. Consistent and nice service. I highly recommend for large groups - it gets very loud in there. Great Lincoln Park find!"
First let me start out my review by the way my experience started out at zed 451... On Tuesday morning I called to make a reservation and spoke with Maria and she had squeezed my party of 2 in for saturday night even though they were all booked up. She did us a huge favor :-) When we arrived on Saturday night we were greeted with nice hello and welcome what it seemed like every host and hostess in the house. One asked us what brought us in that evening and I said our name and to my surprise the young lady who asked us was the receptionist who took our reservation. She escorted us to our seat by a window that only looked out onto clark street but it was window seat none the less before we sat at our table she took us on a quick tour of the harvest table as she remember it was our first time
"I gave the place four stars, but it's really more like 4-1/2. ��We were all very impressed with Giordano's. ��After spending princely sums on restaurants in Chicago and getting, well, not what we felt was our money's worth, this fine pizzeria was a breath of fresh air. ��The service was excellent, even though the place was packed, the pizza and appetizers we got were hot and very good. ��I'm not a deep-dish pizza lover, but I had some of my daughter's and I wished I had ordered it. ��Even so, the ""thin"" crust pizza my son and I shared was superb and more than enough for the both of us, plus some for a doggy bag. ��The final tab, less tip, for six people was $72. ��That's one of the least expensive meals we had in Chicago, and easily the tastiest. ��I highly recommend Giordano's."
"Another one of my favorites. ��THe oliviah (something like that) salad is addicting. ��Its a potato salad with chicken and I cant get enough of it. Especially with that flat bread they give you, and the cheese, love it! ��The staff is really nice and I really enjoy my experience there. ��Everything i've tried i've loved. ��I love kabab's so I cant get enough of them. Plus its a cute neighborhood and I like driving or walking by. ��If you dont drive, the brown line kedzie stop is ..I think one block away. So its very convenient."
I found a fly in my dish!!!!!!! Disgusting!!!!! Seriously!!!! I don't think the sanitation condition in the kitchen is ok.
"FYI Chef Kim left the diner last month.Rumor has it, she's opening her own place. YAY!"
"This place rocks!Cheap, great food. And close to the pad.Thank You 6 lb baby Jesus"
My boyfriend & I came back from vacation addicted to yuca. This place does it right! Empanadas are awesome too! Only reason they didn't get all 5 stars is wait for seating that we always have to suffer through.
"I found these places on YELP, and they are all my favorite in the area. Thanks YELP and YELPERS for sharing your views..I don't go anywhere without at least checking YELP 1st to see what others are saying.

"We had a party of 33 on a Saturday night. ��Let me first say that from the onset of this, planning and speaking with Gwen, we should have gone someplace else! ��Gwen was bossy, rude, and unaccomodating. ��This was booked weeks in advance also! ��Her wait staff was overworked, we asked her to have two wait staff for this party. ��We waited over 1 1/2 hours for our food. ��My main course was done before my potato came. ��The salad bar ran out of lettuce. ��We had to ask for our drinks a two or three times. ��I do not blame the wait staff. ��They were making the best of a poorly run situation. ��The food was ok, nothing that was worth the aggravation. ��Don't bother with this place unless you are just a party of two or four. ��Gwen, please learn how to be personable. ��We had to voice our complaints and sh"
"I really don't understand all the hype about this place...the food is average and too expensive for what it is - not to mention wayyyy too heavy and ALL pork and beef. ��The service is meh. ��I went in for lunch a couple of weeks ago and practically had to beg the bartender to pay attention to me. ��Next time I'll wear ironic glasses and a plaid shirt, that should help."
"I eat here at least once a week. ��I consider Wildfire to be a moderately priced steakhouse. ��When I was ��younger and made less money than i do now, I would consider Outback to be a good place to go have steak at a reasonable price. Wildfire is now that place for me. ��Average meal price with a half bottle of wine and 2 drinks comes out to about $120 for two people. ��Their fixed price steak option is always a good bet - you get a salad, 6oz filet, and dessert for under $40 pp. ��My steak always comes out done like I ask (medium) and I've never had any issues with service. ��They are always busy but you can usually walk in and wait for a table.Definite must haves: ��Wildfire Chopped Chicken Salad, Bacon Wrapped scallop skewers, double stuffed baked potato, Skinny Pineapple Martini, ��and if you g"
"don't believe the hype. my wife and i went to sun wah wanting so much to find a new asian restaurant with good food. the reviews on this place sounded as if you could not go wrong, wrong. first the atmosphere in the place is as if you are in a huge cafeteria - really no aviance just come in and get your food. i do not have a problem with that as long as the food quality and taste makes you forget your surroundings  so after you are seated we looked around and it was a good diverse crowd with what seemed like a large staff serving the people. however ��it was literally 10 minutes before someone showed up to our table and just appeared out of no where and asked are you ready to order - no hello how are you or would you like a drink, just are you ready order. i wanted to get a taste of what th"
"I went to the Bongo Room on a Friday afternoon at about 11:45 am and there was a 30 minute wait to get in. ��I somewhat expected this because I have heard of the place and usually see a line when I drive past on the weekends. When we got in, it took us about 15-20 minutes just to get our drinks and order our meals....slightly long. ��Our waitress was all over the place, in fact it took me over 15 minutes to get a cup of coffee ( I think she forgot)Anyways, I figured this would be water under the bridge once we got our meals. ��I was very dissapointed in the food that came to the table. ��I got a chorizo and avocado egg dish, others at the table got sandwiches, and one got the heath bar pancakes with bananas. ��I have to say, the pancakes were fabulous, best item that anyone had ordered. ��My oml"
"If brunch is your thing, this place is for you. �� Delicious food and great service. ��But you will have to be patient as there is a long wait time. ��But to avoid this, get there early. ��Definitely worth it. ��If it's just 2 or 3 of you, be willing to sit at the ""bar"" to avoid wait time. ��The food is the same. ��Check out the bike shop next door while waiting. ��Street parking is available but you will have to drive around a few times."
I went to Brazzaz on a casual date on a sunday dinner. It was not that busy however it took me 15 minutes to recieve my check after the meal. The waiter does not come around after you start your meat and that i didnt like for the amount that I was paying there.
Pretty god damn good. Endless meat? ��Where else can you find Guaran��? ��Any local Brazilian grocer. ��Delicious.
"This place was really good, not a favorite, but worth going back to."
"I can't believe the reviews that this restaurant is getting! ��I am a foodie and open to interesting food experiences - but this place is a science experiment gone bad. �� ��I would say that only 2 of the 24 tasting bites made me say wow. ��That's not the percentage you are expecting when you pay $1000 for 2 people for dinner.Too many freeze dried, liquid nigrogen items - this treatment was used on a least 5 of the dishes. �� There is very little in the way of actual food. �� Don't get me wrong, I love tasting menus, small portions and fine dining. �� ��I expected just little bites - so it is not at all about the quantity of food - it is about the taste and flavours. ��So underwhelming. �� �� This restaurant it all flash and illusion with very little substance. ��If you have money to burn and want to "
"I will keep it brief. I love my neighborhood and I want to support any independently owned business in it but I will not do this blindly. But when you feel like a restaurant is really working hard to do it right, you can't help but fall in love with it. Ths place simply gets it. From the design to the menu to the service, we just really felt like this was a place that really cares. We ordered lightly and cautiously but everything we had was creative and perfectly done and we will back to try everything. The staff was warm and humble. Bravo!"
Great food. ��Perfect for a client lunch.
"Rick Bayless and his crew rock, big time !!! This is just about the best Mexican food outside of Oaxaca, San Miguel de Allende, DFA, Toda Santos, etc. ��When on the menu I must have the swiss chard with Queso Blanco - right now a featured appetizer is oysters with habenero mioneta which will make you swoon, tamal de rajas are sublime! ��No need to go on - everything (yes, EVERYTHING) on the menu will satisfy the most discerning diners.Must go place - my favorite place - the flavors will jump off your tongue!"
"I know it's unhealthy but I can't stop myself from getting the Flaming Cheese for my appetizer every time I go there. I'm not a big greek food buff but I do enjoy it from time to time and of the places in greektown, this is my favorite place so far. Their daily specials are great and I generally end up getting whichever lamb special they have. Please try it out, I think you'll love it!"
"Food was 4+ quality, but our service made this 5-stars. My wife bounced around a couple things she wanted and our server suggested one--which she took--and loved. ��The wine selection was awesome, so we trusted him to bring us the perfect wine to compliment out food...and he NAILED it (he did this again later with a dessert wine). When asked why we picked Wildfire, we mentioned it was our anniversary dinner...to which he promptly brought us a mouth-watering brownie a la mode (on the house) BEFORE he brought around the dessert tray, which of course you can't pass on. ��He stopped at our table enough if we needed something, but mainly left us alone to talk and enjoy our evening. ��Amazing, amazing place.We spent $200, but had a drink, three glasses of wine, a bottle of wine (which we took most "
My husband and I went to sprout on the second night of opening weekend. ��We didn't have very high expectations for the food since it just opened pretty quickly. ��We were more there since we are big fans of Top Chef and wanted to check out and support the former contestant's new place...but WOW WERE WE BLOWN AWAY BY THE FOOD. �� I started with the Scallop appetizer and my husband had the Foie Gras and both were incredible. ��We both had the short rib entree and for the first time in my life I finished an entire portion of red meat. ��Delish! ��I can't wait to go back!
Demera Ethiopian Restaurant has excellent food - so very tasty!! They have a great menu and the service is very efficient and friendly. The tables and restaurant are always clean as well! I absolutely love their food. I highly recommend. The food was to die for. I found the very interesting place to eat.
"The food here is amazing, there is no questioning that. ?The reason I am giving it 1 star is the terrible service. ?I went here around Thanksgiving and the owner always greets with a smile and is happy to have you. ?The waiters are underwhelmed and seem like they could care less if you dine their or not. ?As soon as we finished eating they plopped our check on the table making us feel pressured to leave. ?It was very busy so we assumed it was a one time thing and decided to go back for Valentines dinner. ?Our reservation was for 2 at 7:30 and we were sat at a table attached to another party as if we were all dining together. ?Very awkward. ?After 2 appetizers, and dinner we had been there for just under an hour when our bill was plopped on the table and they began clearing and busing the t"
"I've been there couple times. I honestly think is very typical Chinatown restaurant but outside of Chinatown. I think the food is overpriced, but it seems that everyone else on the review didn't think so. I agree this is a great place for big crowd, the place is huge.I am not a big fan of duck (But I guess I have to tried it from here, since everyone talk about duck on their review.) so next time i am there, I am gona try their duck."
The real deal in mexican. Sometimes you have to wait but not too long. The best mexican I have had in Chicago. Cash only.
"O M G. This Veg. place is the BEST I've ever eaten, by FAR. The Reuben is to die for, I recommend going to this place immediately--they have VEGAN CHEESECAKE!!!! wtf? why would annnnyone not eat vegan I do not understand. meat/dairy cause cancer, heart disease & a host of other diseases believe it, read The China Study & go veg forever!"
"very good chicago style pan pizza. ��Pequod's is better in my mind, but this is a great alternative."
The best Mexican food I've had in Chicago! this location is the better of the two (Go to this location trust me!).
A meat lovers paradise. Excellent service. Tasty food. Went there last week for Father's Day. I'm planning to come back soon :-)
you have a way of making me come..........back.
"Excellent! ��And Reasonably Priced! ��My favorites: ��Pho Ga, Fresh Shrimp Sprint Roll, Papaya Salad w/Shrimp!"
"I have to agree with Gwendolyn this place is AWESOME!!!! We were in for our first time last Saturday to celebrate a birthday, and it definitely wont be our last time there. Everything was great starting with the complimentary appetizers that were sent over by the owner to the exceptional service that we were given by our server Cris. He was very patient in explaining to us about the dishes on the menu and had great suggestions. ��We all had different dishes and we were extremely satisified with them all. ��We also enjoyed the staff all comming over to our table to sing Happy Birthday. We enjoyed our evening and will returning to La Villa very soon."
"Seriously overrated and probably would never go back. Midway thru dinner for the all you can eat crablegs, the waitress informed us that our table was waiting for other customers and that we only have a two hour limit and that we should put our orders in right away if we wanted more crablegs. She also ran out after us into the street to inform us that we did not tip enough. Granted it was an oversight because we were literally ��rushed out of the place. After retabulating the bill, seems as tho she added an extra 20 bucks on there any way for air maybe and miscalculated it herself. And they should not call their lobster roll a lobster roll when it is not! They should just call it crab salad sandwich if anything. Leads you to believe it's authentic when it is'nt. Calamari was good, but small"
The food is UNREAL!!!
"This store has experienced a very steep decline in both food quality and customer service over the last several months. It really is quite a shame as it used to be at the top of Chicago' s high end grocery stores. The bakery in particular has declined dramatically over the last few months. The breads and rolls are frequently overcooked and taste burned, while the pastries frequently seem to be old and stale. In the past, I would have said that Fox and Obel has some of the best breads in the city. This is certainly no longer the case.The cheese and deli counters also have a similar problem of selling items well past their prime. As far as customer service goes, the person behind the cheese desk is usually either vaguely incompetent, or just plain ignorant of what they are selling. At a stor"
"Very good place if you enjoy the Viagra triangle crowd that flocks to Hubbard. ��Think: orange, receding, douche-types. ��A Rockit Ranch production so you know the space is going to look amazing. And it does!Service was excellent especially since I was with a large group.Did not have the sushi. Had actual food.The actual food was like BEN PAO, or a saltier and less appetizing version of PF CHANG'S.Had:- Chicken and mushroom dim sum: Trader Joe's frozen is better. It was soggy, bland, and just overall gross- Lemongrass beef lollipops: excellent meat quality as it fell off the bone, oversalted like crazy though. It was like sucking on a big giant rock of Bolivian rose salt. High quality yes. Sodium explosion no.- Roasted duck hash salad: highly highly recommended by the waiter. Was a plate wit"
"Best hot dogs ever. No real comparison at this point and I'm not really a hot dog person. The menu changes consistently and is posted on the wall (by the time you get to the menu everything looks good), the options keep you interested even if you've been to Hot Doug's before. The duck fat fries weren't bad, but for me, they underwhelmed. That being said, the hot dogs more than made up for the fries. As most everyone else has already pointed out, Doug works the counter and is friendly as can be. Doug's got a great sense of humor, quirky, down-to earth and will offer suggestions based on whatever info you give him (though you really can't go wrong). Best hot dogs, ever.The only downside is the wait and that it's crowded. We waited for around an hour and a half, which for some is ridiculous f"
"I love and dream about Sun Wah, but I'm actually a little sad that they moved to their new location. ��I'm thrilled that the bathrooms are clean now, but it lost something now that specials are no longer written on the back of a paper plate and taped to the wall. ��That being said, the food is great - especially the rice noodles with vegetables (extra crispy) and Chinese broccoli."
I'm new to the neighborhood and finally chose to stop her to get my coffee in the morning. I was impressed by the intricate cakes displayed in the windows. Although the inside it quite small the coffee and my bagel were Delicious. i also noticed the area next store where i could ��see myself ��stopping ��on my way home to catch up on some work. I will definitely be back soon
Great food. ��Great chef. �� Love Andersonville ..
The real deal.... YOU WILL LOVE THEM!!!!
i have noooooooooo words to describe how amazing this place was! like paradise!!! and one of those fancy restaurants you see in the movies!!!!!!
"Always great ��to dine in a Italian restaurant and Italian food is my favorite. Sabatino's deserves 5 stars. The steak is perfectly marbled and grilled and the amazing crispy French fries)are simply destined to go.They have excellent soups. On my last visit we had a lovely cold Tomato puree that was to die for. The flavors were perfect, and I am not normally a fan of cold soups with the steak on this plate.The pasta dishes here ��are always the measuring stick for me and Sabatino's has some very appealing choices. The meat and seafood courses have always been impressive. The chef has a light hand and one rarely sees anything overcooked. Last time I was here 3 months ago tried the Agnello Casalinga which is a grilled lamb chop done with shitake mushrooms and julienned bell peppers in a white "
"Loved it!!! Gourmet salad bar. Excellent selection of brazillian drinks, will definitly go again"
"Sabatino's is hands-down one of my very favorite restaurants. ��Great ambience, fantastic waitstaff, very fairly-priced food that has few if any equals (quality-wise) that I know of. ��The soups are wonderful--the spinach stracciatella is a favorite of mine. The side dish of pasta that accompanies all entrees is a real standout--because of the delicious homemade gravy/sauce--you will savor every bite. ��The veal braciole is amazing and is absolutely one of my favorite things on the menu.Sabatino's is a fantastic restaurant --I have never been disappointed by ANYTHING I have ordered there; the portion sizes and courses provided for the prices they charge are a great value and well worth every penny. ��For great, traditional Italian food, Sabatino's is the place."
"My husband and I ate at Graham Elliot's last evening for the first time. Decor is great, and love the idea that the menu is printed on one side of old record album covers. Speaking about the menu...if you are very hungry and going there for dinner(we were famished after shopping and walking around the city all day), ��this is NOT the place to dine. First off, the cocktails are small. There is no bread/crackers of any kind offered - just flavored POPCORN (a trendy idea, yes, but c'mon!) I was dying for some good bread - flat bread, anything...The menu is pretty trendy - and limited. The portions --appetizers and entrees -are small. My chicken breast entree was excellent, but way to small of a serving. Needless to say, the four of us were still hungry after our meal, and couldn't wait to go e"
"Always great for special occasions. We go and celebrate birthdays, graduations, anniversaries, and always have a great time! The zuppa di pesce is my favorite! and we just tried the pumpkin pasta, wow!"
Good to see a hip cool bar in logan square. quality food and good homemade beer. great place to meet with friends or to bring a date.
"What a terrible way to run a restaurant! ��I think their belly is full with how much money they make. ��I have been to this place on several occasions in the past including last night. ��I have to admit their food are good however service really really sucks. ��We were waiting close to two hours trying to get rest of our four dishes. ��When we confronted the manager about it, instead of apologizing, he was making excuses and had an attitude of if you do not like it, you do not have to stay. ��The owner of this place should be shame of himself for have staff like the ones above. ��Instead of counting money at home, he should make attempt to visit his store to see how customers are being treating. ��Will never never go back to this awful place."
"This place is awesome, Been coming here for years, Great tacos, The staff is great as well, And if your on a tight budget, No worries, This joint is cheap, No parking but take a cab and bring your own beer, Kuz they don't have a liquor license, Damn I'm craving this place now @ 2:30 AM."
"I am not crazy about the food, but I have not given it too many tries. ��The drinks on the other hand are great. I love the crowd, the way the owner decorated this restaurant is hands down out of this world. Definitely a crowd pleaser."
"Noise levels in US restaurants are often challenging for non-US diners and are usually unsuitable for those wanting a quiet & romantic dinner for two. In tonight's case, none of the smaller tables in Bonsoiree's intimate space could compete with the table of 7 corporate queens/come entertainers that managed to increase cackle & screech volume with each of the 7 courses. We both left with headaches and ringing eardrums. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the menu and were pleased with our server's competence, friendliness and efficiency.The baked scallop and crab in the shell was lovely, as was the caramelized banana bread and butter pudding.The coffee in the veal & coffee consomme was a little too over-powering (with the chocolate as well!) and some more seasoning would also have helped the pork cho"
"I love Carnivale! ��I went there for a business dinner and was wowed by everything- the decor, the bar, the food, the service- everything was unbelievable. ��Definitely a nice upscale place to go for dinner or drinks."
"Wowzer....this place is fantastic!!First, I must say that the ambiance of the place is spectacular. We went on a Wednesday night and had a fantastic time. The space is warm, inviting, and comfortable. The service is unlike many other restaurants in the city. They are very attentive-from managers, to servers, to bussers-all stopping by to make sure all was taken care of. Our server, Jonathon, was fantastic and made our experience both satisfying and fun. He was very knowledgeable and helped guide us to the perfect wine and meal-all with a bit of wit and charm!The hush puppies were amazing!! I'm still thinking about them. We split the Comp St Louis and the pork and had never had better tasting meat-incredibly tender, flavorful, and juicy. The bbq is good but honestly, it's not really needed."
"What a shame.1. Salad was absolutely drowned in dressing. The greens were floating in dressing. Also, the greens were nothing spectacular: generic salad mix.2. The cheese fondue is like Gruyere nacho cheese. By the time we were finished it was congealing on the sides of the pot. It is awfully thick, and seems as though it must have been prepared hours earlier and sat in a pot waiting. The cheese, if it truly is Gruyere, is obviously low quality. By the end I was eating plain pretzel bread (pretty good) to try to get the taste out of my mouth. 3. Chocolate was fine. The pound cake was pretty burnt.We skipped any sort of meat, noting that they advertised grain-fed USDA Choice beef, as if that were something to be proud of. In an age when many restaurants are offering grass-fed options beef ("
Spacca Napoli is hands down the best Italian restaurant I've ever eaten at. The pizza's take ONLY a couple minutes to cook and the crust is delicious. I didn't think I would be a fan of one of their pizza's with only marinara sauce but it was unbelievable. The cheese pizza also has the best cheese. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to eat at an authentic Italian restaurant!
"I will start off by saying that I am not a vegetarian by any means. I love my hamburgers, ribs, seafood and more! However, the Chicago Diner is one of my favorite places to eat in Chicago. The service is fantastic, the food is always so fresh and so tasty, the atmosphere is great and if you like hazelnut coffee you MUST try theirs. I usually hate flavored coffees cuz I never taste the flavor they say they are, but whatever they're doing here, it's working. I hope that if you are not a vegetarian like myself will you at least try this place out because it is well worth your money. My only complaint would be that I wish it was slightly bigger in order to accommodate the amount of people that show up. PS I totally tried the thanksgiving meal here this past year- better than what I would have "
"* It's the usual only-in-Chicago inexplicable curse ... After blissfully browsing for a million years at Reckless, you emerge onto Milwaukee starving to death, but assuming that as in ANY OTHER CITY IN THE WHOLE WORLD, you'll be surrounded by high-calibre quick-service eatery options, only to straggle down to Division miles later having found NOT ONE NORMAL DECENT EATING OPTION along the entirety of the whole damned stretch of garbage storefronts, hipper-than-thou-bars, and assorted rubbish of various kinds (No, I'm not including any place that serves fake meat and is affiliated with the evil Yahweh cult) ... So FINALLY you wolf down your tacos at La Pasadita, and they're ... passable ... Ah, yes, Chicago ... It's a stumper."
"We've been searching for a new Indian restaurant, and just discovered India House today. ��We went to the buffet. ��I've never had a buffet like this before- it was amazing. ��The selection and quality of the buffet was unlike any place I've ever been (at $15 it isn't cheap, but more than worth it). ��As a vegetarian, I had 5 different entree options, and all were distinct and absolutely delicious. ��Others have written that it is the best Indian food in Chicago, and based solely on the buffet, I would say that isn't far off. ��The only minus is that parking is a pain because of the location."
I always wanted to tell the world what a fantastic restaurant this is .... ��I would want to work here for free for a few weeks just to see how the do it and I am not talking just about the out standing quality of food but service trully when I think of above and beyond customer service I think fogo ... I mean really keep up the fantastic job wow love the place
"I will never forget our experience in Sunda. Our Server was amazing! Interior design was perfect! All Interior made by an professional interior architect , it was so obvious. If you are asking about food, Yes i recommend. Do you like Asian Cuisine? Try their Pear Sake! You will love it"
Bayless can do no wrong in my opinion. the tortas are amazing. the churros are incredible. lots of craft beers. cool atmosphere. love this place and anything that ick Bayless cooks.
Great cubano and ��Vieja Roja
"I love love love the beer choices here. Every time I have friends in town, this is a must visit. Whether we end up in the dining room, upstairs, or in the front bar, I enjoy the food and drinks. The last time we went, we sat up front and joined a regular with a friend from Charlotte, NC. We enjoyed the addition and he shared his table. The beer choices are always amazing and slightly overwhelming. The mussels and fries are always a favorite to share. Even their glassware complimenting the beer is extensive. The only draback can be the noise level, but I am sensitive to that since I am blind and hearing is important when you can't see."
The food was great. The bar was kinda crowded and drinks were expensive. Maybe the city should lower taxes so the resturaunts don't have to charge so much.
"I know that everyone is obsessed with the steaks at wildfire, but the macademia crusted halibut is my favorite entree on the menu. I always trade in my side for the bbq sweet potato, which is really yummy. I just love the atmosphere of this place as well!"
Loved it! ��I went there for a friends birthday and we had the best time! ��Great atmosphere. ��Great crowd. ��Great service! ��I would highly recommend Sunda!
"We arrived early, about 6:30, and good thing we did! ��The place quickly filled up with hungry carnivores. ��We had been forewarned to skip the salad bar in order to take full advantage of the meat offerings, but the salad bar was so large and so beautiful that we had to nibble on SOMETHING! ��So I chose a few beets (a personal fave), some giant asparagus spears and a couple wedges of cheese to tide me over until the Meat Parade. ��(I even spied a huge bowl of crispy bacon on the salad bar -- wow! -- there's something you don't see every day!) ��We noticed that the four-top of guys next to us had heaping plates of salad -- we shook our heads in sadness at their folly! ��We nibbled our salad, drank some wine, and a server soon brought out side dishes of tasty polenta, fried plantains and garlic m"
"RUDE! ��My husband and I live in Andersonville and enjoy going to Icosium for a salad or crepe and their tasty soup. ��However, the last several times we went there we were greeted by the staff telling us they would be closing soon. ��It was 8:30 and they closed at 9:00. ��I've never had to work so hard to purchase something. ��Most restaurants will tell you when the kitchen closes, and give you time to enjoy your meal. ��There were diners at several tables. ��The food is good, but service can be rude and slow."
"The Good: The food & service are absolutely remarkable. ��I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good place for a family outing or even a romantic date for two. ��You are constantly served new portions/items by various waiters. ��You really will try every piece of meat imaginable at this place. Also the salad bar alone could be a restaurant, it's beautiful. The Bad: The price, I think they're a little over priced, BUT they always email 25% and sometimes 50% off coupons.The Ugly: ��The ugly is that this place is not next door to me, so I could eat their everyday"
"Fantastic deep dish, the cornmeal crust is excellent"
"PROS: Great design, friendly staff.CONS: Horrible food, staff too amateur. Seriously, maybe the worst food I have ever had at a restaurant. We tried almost everything and there was not even one thing that we could find tasty. At one point I thought we were on a candid camera and they were bringing us horrible food intentionally. Sad thing is, it's all real and it costs A LOT."
"It was incredible. ��The outside seating was perfect, our waiter Buck was so accomodating and everything he recommended was so wonderful!! The flavors in the food was great. The portion sizes was more than I anticipated and took a lot of it home. Just a wonderful experience all around and will definitely go back for more."
Killer.Number 81--and I get to eat it while listening to hip hop and being served by the coolest Vietnamese teenagers ever? That's pretty much all it takes in my book.
"nice looking store, but watch out for the bread. ��It looks good but it smells and tastes burnt."
This is steak utopia! ��The staff is great and the food is perfect!
Hipsters! I am on a cupcake crawl! dont give me attitude I just want a cupcake!!!! Ahh!
An over hour ��wait? ok i dont mind that i guess but i feel like the food quality was better a few years ago before it got so busy. this place has just gotten too busy as bucktown has grown and quality has suffered
"Great food! Great atomosphere! Great Experience!I went with a group of six, and it was surprisingly cheaper than expected, especially after sharing 4 bottles of wine. The food was delicious, our server was great, and we really enjoyed ourselves. I plan on going back sometime soon, with my roommates in tow. It is definitely worth checking out!"
"This place is AMAZING! It's so hard to find real authentic Italian food, but Caro Mio really does an amazing job. I love their gnocci that is stuffed with riggota cheese, and a creamy vodka-like sauce, it's amazing. The restaurant is really small, so on busy nights sometimes there is a wait but it's always worth it. It's also BYOB which is fun, and they don't charge you to open bottles which is cool. Overall, this place is awesome, great food, good prices and just a cool atmosphere."
"Always good food! ��And the nice thing about it, it's always consistently good. ��Yes, I know most complaints are about the wait time, but plan on going during non-busy hours; best times are between 2 and 5. ��And of course, the other complaint (or at least my complaint...): portions are big; ��so I usually share one entree with my husband, or get 2 appetizers, and still have room for dessert!!"
"Get there after lunch hours to avoid the long line. ��It does move along pretty quickly though and once inside you get your food FAST. ��Awesome place. ��Fredhots is another awesome place for hot dogs if you're in the Glenview area. ��Hey Doug, if you and Fred put on boxing gloves, who would win? ��:D"
"Great atmosphere with a young bar scene. I had high expectations and some of the food was not that impressive. I would skip the Ceasar salad- the croutons are amazing, but the rest of the salad lacks flavor and is sparse. The gnocchi was the best dish I tried. Skip the fish and try a meat dish. The desserts looked amazing, although we were too full to try. I would go back for dessert and a drink, but wouldn't run back for the food."
SuperDawg is a must go. ��The only suggestion I have is to a veggie dog on the menu. ��It seems only fair for a hot dog place in a modern society.
"First off the restaurant has a great atmosphere, wonderful drinks, and great service. Why only 3 stars... because i would give the food 1 star. Super overpriced small portions of sub-par food.Lemongrass beef lollipops- ��I was told that this was one of the best items on the menu, the beef was extremely dry and almost Sunda Poke- way too much sauce, it was all i could tasteA selection of sushi and sashimi - we choose about 8 different types, and i have to say it didn't look like a sushi chef had sliced the fish. It looked like something i could do at home, as for the taste the salmon was very fishy. Tuna and scallop were very good, but the worst sushi rice i have ever tasted.Honey-ginger braised beef shortribs- We got this because of the yelp reviews. The beef was melt in you mouth wonderful"
"The Gage is in my top ten in Chicago. The management is exceptional, actually worked with Terry in 1986 @ Bistro 110, so clearly he has vast experience. Dave has been an executive chef for literal decades, again he has real experience to run the front of the house. The menu is fantastic, the servers right on. Kid-friendly? Not so much, but my 3 year old survived the experience!!Unfortunately, Open Table is not quite fine-tuned! Changed my reservation from 4 to 5 people, never noted. The Gage rocked the discrepancy, we had the best table in the house!!Apparently once upon a time!!To the General Manager!!I thought it was crititcal that I drop you a note after your complete dismissal of me lastnight! Whilst I understand you are incredibly busy, now that you are the General Manager of two rest"
Bad experience with seating and hostess. Limited seats for four. ��Must order food before you have a seat. Unfriendly and unprofessional hostess. I wont go back or recommend to anyone.
"Very good, close to excellent. ��Decor is world class and if I didn't know better I would think I was in French imperial Vietnam. ��Great black and white pics of Vietnam day to day life adorn the walls. ��The green foliage really freshens up the atmosphere. ��Everything I have ordered has been great especially the scallop salad."
"Great Hot Dogs/Sausages, recommend going before 12 to beat the rush!"
"I am not surprised by some of the reviews here for Bonsoiree. We dined at the restaurant for the first time right around New Years. It was so disappointing, that we actually wrote a hand written letter to the owner to let him know about our experience. He never contacted us. So here I am on YELP. Our meal was completely ruined by a waiter that smelled like he had not showered in a month. It was so disgusting that I laughed when they brought over a dish that was dramatically uncovered to unleash an aroma of...well....something...but, we couldn't tell because he smelled THAT bad. The group next to us even commented on the overwhelming odor. I am annoyed by the experience, but more angry about their lack of response to us. We spent over a couple hundred dollars on a meal that we could simply "
I was here about 3 months ago. The food overall was good. But the manager/owner of the establishment was very rude. A young woman who saw something in the kitchen that horrified her went up to the counter to complain to the manager/owner. My bf and I were sitting right next to the counter and this girl just kept complaining in English about how she was going to call the health dept. and the police. She told him that he was rude because he was speaking Spanish and refused to speak English. She was Mexican/American and explained that she wasn't going to speak to him in Spanish just because he didn't want to take care of the situation that happened in the kitchen. It left me wondering what had the woman seen in the kitchen that was so horrifying and disturbing? The food was good but it was cr
"can't help you with the beer as i am not a beer drinker but i can say best brunch ever! the servers are always so nice and accommodating (i'm a notoriously picky eater). i've only been once for dinner. i had the burger and mashed potatoes. my burger was good but mashed potatoes were sublime. for brunch, i always get the steak and eggs and it's always perfect. i will be back again and again and again."
"First off I have to say that my standards for mexican food are Extremely high, particularly when it comes to the margaritas, and that Mayan is far and above my favorite restaurant in the whole city! ��I've been coming to Mayan for years, and though its popularity has boomed in recent years it still has the best service and feeling of family warmth. ��I love this place so much, that I have taken it upon myself to convert all my friends into believers too. ��not a complaint yet! ��And if that wasn't enough ... ��half price margaritas Tues/Thurs?? ��'nough said"
"Absolutely love this place! I'm going to keep this short and recomend that when you do go (and you should!) sit by the bar to watch how meticulously they make your drinks. Then enjoy sipping on your perfect little concoction, I reccomend the Romeo and Juliet!"
"For South of the Border Fare? It simply does not get better than this.Perhaps the most amazing ceviche I have had in years. A perfect, crisp and authentic Mezcal spritz was paired by our server. AMAZING.Alas, no Bayless sightings... but my wife and I felt like it was our seconf=d honeymoon.The real revelation was the price. We would have payed 3 times as much for the pleasure.GO!"
Totally in love with this place. I will be back!!
"I have never been in a restaurant this loud. ��It was pretty cool. ��This is considered one of the top restaurants in the country, so I might have been a little outclassed.The alcohol was expensive but good.I showed up with my gf, and I was seated at the bar immediately.All of the food that we ordered was interesting and tasty. ��It was a place that I was happy to go to, but I doubt that I would return on my next trip to Chicago. ��We had:Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana - my favorite. ��It was about a one cup container.Chorizo Stuffed Olives - Again, this was a very flavorful dish, one I would have never considered. 6 olives.Pork Blade Steak with 'Nduja & Honey - This was tasty, but honestly I could have made this. ��It was a big pork steak well-cooked.Manil"
"I walked in here last night with my husband not really knowing what to expect. ��It is a tiny little place with a great patio and decorated with pictures and newspaper clippings. ��I loved it, it's quirky and fun. We ordered two dinners, one steak and one pork. ��They each come with white rice, black beans, and sweet plantains. ��We also ordered 2 beef empanadas. We ordered to go and arrived home ravenous. ��The food smelled so good in the car that my mouth was watering and I was tempted to start eating before we even got to the house, but alas, I waited. My husband opened his pork dinner first and before he could even get a chance to take a bite I swooped in a grabbed a piece of the shredded pork. ��Holy muther. ��It was as tender as my heart and melted in my mouth, I think my eyes even rolled b"
"Quick update on another great experience... ��I ordered catering for an office meeting on the Northiside of Chicago.It was last minute, and Ididn't think I was going to be able to find someone to cater. I called Fogo around 9:30am, and they were able to make the catering happen for us by noon. I was able to feed 20 people, got some pizzas and salads, and the owner actualy delivered it along with another employee. VERY IMPRESSIVE!!!! �� Almost forgot..When I ordered, the employee told me to go to their website to say 10% on my first online order as well. Eventhough I am not spending my own money, I realized what a great deal this is, and that placed the order online as well..Thanks FOGO for making my day!!!!!!!!"
I don't think I could name one thing I didn't like about this restaurant. The wait staff works as a group so you don't have to look for one waiter for a refill on water. I don't think I had time to think between the times I was offered meat. It was worth the price and I cannot wait to go back
12 oz dry-aged NY strip is the only way to go when at Kinzie. We have been several times and always leave happy.
Damn good chicken.
"great place ! love the food but, they have to remodel ..... it looks pretty old but its still a really good resturaunt! i recommend tank noodles out of any other pho place! but just remodel..... other than that LOVE ITTTT (:oh and there are really nice workers ! very friendly"
"This is one of the better restaurants with Lettuce Entertain You. ��They have fabulous steaks, and the best salads. ��I love their petite filet wrapped in bacon- it's delicious. ��They have great shrimp skewers for appetizers, and they have out of this world desserts."
"My husband and I have a delicious anniversary dinner at Sprout. ��Their $60 pre-fixe for three course is really quite moderate because it also includes a sorbet and a cheese course. ��We also added on wine pairings for $25/person and that was well worth it. ��I had the scallop appetizer while my husband had the egg. ��Both were delicious. ��For the main course, I had the rabbit and my husband had the lamb. ��Both were so delicious and tasty. ��The entree sizings were just right. ��You are not taking home leftovers after this meal, but instead leave pleasantly full. ��For dessert, I had the corn and my husband had the banana. ��I just had to try the corn because I couldn't imagine how corn might be made to be sweet, but the chef accomplished that beautifully. ��Probably one of the most unique desserts"
"Don't go here for cool atmosphere, even though you'll find a great, ��low-key, hip feel. ��And don't go here for the phenomenal drinks even though, they are, in fact, phenomenal (my favorite is the Templeton Rye Manhattan, but they have amazing Mezcal and specialty drinks). ��Go and keep your palate and head sober, fresh and clean, at least until you've tasted each course of Rick Bayless's menu selections. Amazing chicken taquitos, ��pork meatballs, ��and cream spinach appetizers; delicious entrees and beautiful, delectable desserts. ��We went there last October and experienced absolutely amazing main dishes on Mexican Independence Day; went back two days ago and enjoyed the food even more. Be prepared for the noise and energy, but take the food slow. ��If you pace yourself the menu changes so yo"
All I can say is that this place is fantastic.I been here a dozen times & it is always great. You will never be let down.
"Great building, nice cafe, good sandwiches, a regular part of my visits to Chicago. Have seen (and tasted) some incredibly gorgeous cakes from here. Excellent catering and delivery."
"Went here because a friend received a gift certificate and we thought we would try it. ��Very expensive for what it is, but thought it would be good. ��Their ceviches were not really ceviches and were not very good. ��Their guacamole was average and the entree we got was pretty much an appetizer portion for almost $30. ��Between the average sangria and the less than average food, it was a joke the bill was so high. ��We would never return and we would never recommend this place. ��What a waste of $125! ��I hardly ever take the time to review any place and tonight was so disappointing I felt compelled to write a review."
I really enjoy eating at this restaurant. Its a nice environment with really hard working people. Their desserts are to die for. I feel like I gain a lb or two whenever I step into that place because I cannot stop eating their desserts. I even take some to go for my friends and family. We always order their mango cake for the birthdays we celebrate in our family. The only bad thing is that the parking is horrible. You have to be fast and the furious when trying to find parking.
"Bad Apple + a trip to Half Acre brewery across the street = an awesome start to a Saturday.Bad Apple has awesome food, delicious blood mary's and a pimp beer list. I'd definitely recommend trying this place. The staff is really friendly, the space is always clean and the service is good. Price point is totally reasonable too."
"WOW...I am so surprised by how much I didn't care for the chicken at Crisp..It's not that I don't enjoy greasy fried chicken,,,,cause I do..but I normally avoid eating it, like at KFC, but had the desire to eat some fried chicken(maybe feeling anxious..I don't know). ��Anyway, I got the Plane Jane and a soda pop..1/2 chicken was the smallest I could get..It cost over $10 which was amazing to begin with.That's alot for fried boney chicken. I then sat down yesterday, Tuesday, and sat at a picnic table that was shared with other people around lunch. We all had to share these brown paper towel rolls, all with other people's greasy fingers on them as well...Im not a fancy person, but having my own individual napkin is like a minimum eating need that I have at a restaurant..Maybe this is how they"
2 stars just on ambiance because i do not know what the big hype about there food. I been here several times and it's just alright and not worth the wait or price? It's basic Cuban food! Nothing special.. There are way better Cuban places in Chicago that never raise there prices every 2 months
"paid a $12 dollar cover only to walk in & receive rude & pretentious service from the bar staff. Ended up leavin without finishing our drinks. And I'm not just some disgruntled needy patron, I'm actually a 10 year service industry/bartender veteran. I know good service and I know bad. Green mills was definitely not good. It's a shame cause the ambiance is nice & the place has great character & potential. Oh well."
"What can I say besides: STAY AWAYMy wife and I went out for a nice dinner last evening and by virtue of circumstance, ended up at Shaw's.We had a 9:30 reservation and arrived early at 9pm. ?This was a Saturday and the place was NOT busy. ?This should have been our que to leave. ?In fact, when we arrived we were the ONLY people waiting for a table. ?Several other couples arrived in the meantime, one of which announced that they had a 9:30 reservation too. ?Yes, they were seated a full 15 minutes ahead of us. ?Being a bi-racial couple, I would like to go ahead and play the RACISM card, but I won't go there. There's plenty of other negative things about our dining experience that will send my review of Shaw's into the dirt.We finally sat were waited on promptly and ordered the Calamari appeti"
"Every restaurant should have a dual colored coaster (red on one side, green on the other) on each table that lets the staff know that even though you've consumed more food in 30 minutes than many small towns in South America, that you've not yet reached capacity. Excellent salad bar (but save room for the meat). Very good quality meat and a great selection. The last time I was there, a guy at the table next to us did not stop chewing for the duration of my visit, about 2 hours. Don't be that guy.Those complaining about the price, consider this - at a steakhouse of equal quality, my meal would have cost about 2 grand. If you like to eat, it's a bargain."
Just got back from Shaw's. ��Great oysters. ��They have like 12 varieties to choose from. ��We sat at the bar in back and enjoyed 1/2 off oysters between 4 - 6 PM. ��Great deal.
"Oh my god! I love this pizza. ��I had driven by Spacca Napoli 6 days a week for 8 months before finally trying it. ��I have young kids and my husband makes really yummy homemade pizza. ��We never go out for pizza. We finally made it when we needed an early Saturday lunch in Ravenswood with 4 adults and 2 kids. ��We got there as it opened. ��No waiting, and I think that is the secret. ��If you can ever make it for lunch..... I have been on weekday and weekend for lunches and found few other people in the place. ��I am awed by hot quickly the pizzas are made and cooked. ��*Fast is good for a 2 year old and a 4 year old*The staff and restaurant set up are very friendly to kids. ��They can watch the pizza in all stages of the making, and at least during the lunch hour it was easy to do. ��The crust is a"
Oh Doug Sohn how I love thee. i would wait five hours for the pups here
"We tried Nana for lunch with a group from the office. The expectations were high as we had read great reviews and some of the group had been before and loved the food. I had the Mushroom burger with a Cauliflower soup, there were both excellent, portions were huge. My friend had chilaquiles and while not 100% autentic (they are made layered like lasagna and with poblano in the sauce vs the green tomatillo that is how its done authentically) it was a great new take on chilaquiles. Someone had a chicken sandwich HUGE and really good. The food will definitely make me come back for lunch or breakfast. I was, however, dissapointed at the service, the place was busy with large group and maybe that had someting to do with it, while friendy and smiley it lacked that something that makes service gr"
"This is one of the nicest cafes, bakery, desert place you will find in this area! If you are a desert person, you will LOVE their cakes! I am not even going to recommend any, they are ALL delicious! Plus, it is a beautiful decor, you can go anytime of the day, if you just want a coffee and a desert it is the great place to go and relax! The place has a very European feeling. Also, you can grab a bite to eat, they have a good menu, even though I haven't tried their food in a while! I am addicted with their deserts, so anytime I want to splurge I go there!"
"My favourite place for Sunday Brunch!The tempura French toast is AMAZING! As are the rolls we tried and the dim sum.The atmosphere is lovely, relaxing (it was mid-morning on a Sunday, so I dont know what its like at happy hour or for dinner) and the staff attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.The tea bar is great! And the bloody Mary bar is huge with a big selection.If you have guests in town, bring them here for brunch!"
whatever!whatever food;whatever ambiance;whatever servicethere's better all over town! ��this place has run its course!
I am such a fan of the Diner !!! The shakes rock my socks off!! ��I have been going to the diner for a year no and everything is great except I can never get a booth lol but its always worth sitting in the middle and chatting ��with your neighbors about what they ordered!
"Good o-face...no four courser, but the o-face was a good replacement"
"Some of the best Italian food I've had! ��My first experience here the wait staff accidentally sat another couple at our table. ��The second we brought it to their attention, they immediately took us to the bar for a drink on the house, and we were the next people sat. ��We were greeted with excellent wait staff and a fresh homemade loaf of bread for dipping. ��I ordered the lasagna and even though I've been back 4-5 times, I've never ordered anything else. ��The lasagna is just too good to pass up. ��The owner made up for the accident during our first visit (which proved to us that they care) and therefore we will go back again and again. ��Oh, and if you register your name and address with the restaurant, the owner will send you a thank you note for visiting with a coupon for your next visit!"
Great italian food in a comfortable setting. Going to agree with the majority of the reviewers here. Love the Gnocchi!!!
"I love Grand Lux, every time I'm in Chicago I make sure to pay them a visit. I am a not a fan of restaurant chains, but this place consistently delivers. Last time, we were there we had one of the potato filled appetizers, (cannot remember the name!) simply delish! I had the Carbonara and my husband had a pizza Margherita. Very very good! The Carbonara dish tends to be dry most of the time, but it was surprisingly moist. For dessert we had the creme brulee, excellent as well.We have also tried the Grand Lux in Miami, and it was nowhere near as good as this one. Definitely a hit!!!"
"San Soo Gab San is open super late, so why not go at 2am on a Wednesday with your best friend? You can possibly bring in a bottle of wine or 2 and keep said wine under your table. If your server thinks you will leave a decent tip, she may ignore your wine and bring you two empty cups. At least, I think this would work.The two of you will each have to order a meat dish, as 2 is the minimum for getting the grill brought out to your table. Dishes range from $15-$19. The ribeye is divine. The korean marinated beef- not so much. I think it's called bulgogi. It's like philly cheesesteak consistency beef and sounded good, but it didn't cook well. More on that later.....Service is ok, considering the extreme language barrier. Lots of pointing at the menu, smiling and nodding. The menu has everythi"
"My wife and I did the seven course tasting menu. ?Some dishes were better than others. ?The first course was lobster and octopus which was very tasty, however it took almost 20 minutes to get! ?My wife's favorite was the scallop and crab with aioli- so rich and creamy. ?Soup was the third course- nothing memorable- warm soup with mushrooms. ?It was not bad, just nothing i care to have again. ?Main entree was steak and tongue. ?Good, but lacking vegetables. ?It only had a few sea beans- which were very tasty, but it needed more. ?We had a granita, and dessert. ?The dessert was milk and cookies- i wish it were more exciting. ?Not the fireworks at the end of the meal. ?The milkshake was a bit runny, and the cookies were bland. ?We didn't even finish it. ?The waitresses were great. ?There were"
"we went here for my bday, it was awesome.the food was fresh, the salad bar has so many options. the waiter was nice after dinner we head up to the bar upstairs. prices is affordable, the dessert are AMAZING!definitely try out this place!"
"Everything on this menu is dynamite. This was my first time here. I was seated quickly, served quickly, and had a knowledgable server who recommended some killer wine with our dinner. Fresh seafood, unique marinara's and white sauces; the best italian I have had without doubt.Check this place out. There is something on the menu for everyone!"
"First time at Shaw's last night to celebrate 2 birthdays. ��We started off the evening with a bloody mary and pometini, and both were delicious. ��The Lobster bisque was outstanding - creamy with fresh tender lobster. ��We ordered Alaskan King Crab and a Crab combination dinner. ��Both entrees were abundant and delicious- we were unable to finish the Alaskan King Crab dinner. ��I absolutely recommend this place for dinner, and don't forget to ask for Luke - he was a spectacular server. ��We will definitely be going back."
"The Hopleaf gets 5 stars just for their mussels. Possibly the best mussels I've ��ever had. I would go just for them but Hopleaf also has a huge Belgian beer list. Almost all bars in Chicago now have huge craft beer lists but while most are content to settle for 75 different IPAs and 30 Stouts, Hopleaf is one of the few providers of good Belgian beers. The staff is great but there can be an occasional wait. Last time I went Popperings Hommelbier and Mussels!!"
"The service and atmosphere of this restaurant were wonderful so I am basing my one star on the food only.The food at this restaurant was such a disappointment. ��The menu itself looks fantastic. ��Unique and delicious sounding appetizers and entrees fill the pages. ��Almost all of our 4 entrees, however, left much to be desired. ��Everything was way too salty and had awkward pairings. ��On the beet salad there was some odd dressing that tasted kind of like the dust of a raw walnut. ��I hate to give such a bad review to a restaurant with such great service, but I hate even more to see people spend their money on less-than-good food.Great concept, bad execution."
"Best salad bar in Chicago, well next to Fogo De Chao! But way less expensive. Split a sandwich and salad bar for each and you have a healthy happy tummy! My only criticism is the parking situation and the valet guy is less than polite, but that's not Mr. Grunt's fault."
"We dined here on Saturday night. ��Made the reservation on OpenTable and when I called to confirm, I requested to have a table out on the patio. ��This is a MUST do. ��Everything was fantastic. ��The service was impeccable!!! ��The food was amazing!!We had the antipasti platter for appetizer. ��SO good. ��Insanely good. ��The proscuitto melted in our mouths. ��I could have eaten just that and been extremely content.I had the cheese ravioli which was great. ��But almost a touch too rich. ��Don't get me wrong, being from WI, I love LOVE cheese but it was a bit much. ��My BF had the special - mushroom fettucini. ��It was awesome. ��The pasta was deliciously home made and the mushrooms were outstanding. ��The pasta had a great rustic, earthy flavor.For dessert we had gelato which was perfect.I think though t"
"This place is amazing! Here's why:-The food is delicious, fresh, innovative and unbeatable when it comes to taste. If you are a meat eater the meat is so tender, full of juices and cooked to perfection! The ingredients that complement the dish are delectable and although it sounds like a cliche to say, there really is an explosion of taste and excitement in your mouth! I would definitely suggest having the guacamole for an appetizer!-The drinks are amazing! Although they might be a little pricey they are definitely worth every dollar because each sip is an alcoholic mix of bliss! -The surroundings and atmosphere is completely original! This place has the swankiest bathrooms I have even been in! The whole building is an amalgamation of incredible design, bright colors, loud artistic express"
"Carnivale is over the top awesome-Its great for a special occassion, because everything about it makes for a great experience. from the space to the service- I can't wait to make it back there. It's well worth the money, the food itself is amazing- it's like the most beautiful latin cuisine i've ever seen-"
"I wouldn't come here for pho if I was craving pho. ��Surprisingly it gets packed for such mediocre tasting food, tastes like it's been bleached out for attractive measure.. Cred here: I've had at least 12 things off the menu.Reason I went: Because friends were attractive to the look.. sometimes you gotta dismiss the look for good food!"
Its a great place everything is good from food & drinks till service and decorations BUT do not go after 11 pm because you will get the worse service like really rude with (when you gonna leave) attitude !!! specially at the bar !!!
"one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I love the food, drinks, and appetizers.... I always go back....."
"I am not quite sure what the rav about this place is. it is not bad, but it is not great.The feel of the place is nice. I do like the set up and how they have the menu written on the wall/chalk board. It is a small place, but it does have a nice vibe to it.The service here is sold. I did not have any problems what so ever. It was somewhat busy when I went for breakfast...everyone is very polite and prompot.The food prices are not very good. You DNO NOT get what you pay for. Breakfast for two, with tip, ran be $45.00. I received an ok steak, eggs, toast and a juice - person who I had breakfast with had the same. The place is nice, servers are pleasant, food prices and food quality is not all that.I would not make this a must-go-to diner."
"Best/freshest skillets, and fruit plate around, tempting daily specials, and awesome healthy juice drinks. ��They have one of the largest selections of veggies used for their juices and skillets. The skillets are loaded, almost overflowing with the best tasting and freshest veggies available at most of the breakfast spots I've visited. They even have wheatgrass shots. ��Just shy of a 5 star rating for two reasons:1. Hostesses have been know to be fake nice to boarderline rude. ��However, the experienced, friendly, knowledgable servers make up for this.2. A few things I've had have been mediocre: crab cakes and fritattas (too much egg kind of tasted like a bad omlette). Plus, they don't have whole wheat pancakes. Don't ��be discouraged by the long wait, the food comes quickly and the service is"
I went to Geja's 2 times already first time we sat in a booth very romantic the waiter closed the curtains for our romantic dinner.The food was good but I especially loved the melted chocolate with fruit that was the reason i went back the second time.Give this place a try you will be happy.
"Delicious food, good vegetarian options, and the owner & staff are wonderful people. ��Good energy all around!"
"Good food, Good service,Decent price"
"My favorite pizza so far in the city (and that is a big claim). The pizzas are huge. Salads and desserts are equally delicious. I really loved this place and plan on returning often. My only complaint is that its a bit small, when its busy, it feels cramped. But that is the only bad thing I can say about this place. So good! My stomach is growling just thinking about it!"
"Wonderful food, Wonderful staff. Whenever I am in Chicago with my friends we ALWAYS eat breakfast at 3rd Coast. We always have great food and great coffee, esp. the Irish coffee. The 3rd Coast is a must especially for breakfast. The staff are all wonderful people and they almost seem like they are all family, which makes the atmosphere extremely pleasant. I have tried many things on they menu and I have not had anything i did not like. When in Chicago The 3rd Coast is a must."
"This is a great date or business mean restaurant. ��We went here on a Saturday night for my birthday dinner and it did not disappoint. ��Everyone at our table ordered steak and it was nicely done. ��In my case, I had the twin fillets with shrimp stuffed with crabmeat and it was delicious. ��I had the side of the butternut squash and it was tasty. ��I tasted the sweet potato casserole and the mushrooms - to die for, just wonderful. ��This is the kind of place that you make a destination for a great evening out eating.Bring money, they aren't cheap, but you get what you pay for, as you know.I thoroughly recommend Ruth's Chris Steak house as a great restaurant in Chicago."
Great place! Very good customer service and friendly servers. Good food.Highly recommend it!
"Love this place. ��Word to the non-Koreans, best K-restaurants are ""hole in the walls"" that don't cater to the ambiance of the place, but to the taste and variety of food. ��Took my non-asian co-workers there and had a blast. ��Loved the plum wine and bottles of Kirin beer."
Carmelized �� nothing like it
I had second thoughts about posting this review because the incident I am referring to happened a couple of years back and I haven't been back to Nuevo Leon because of the incident.I went in one night during the week with my wife and ordered my usual skirt steak. I had eaten here at least 4 or 5 times before. The steak came out and I smelled something very strange and disturbing. At first I did not think it was my food and thought it might just have been my imagination. I took my first bite and realized my steak was flat out rotten. I could not believe it and let my wife have a sniff and she was shocked. My first instinct was to take the plate right up to the front counter and demand to speak with a manger/owner but I didn't want to create a scene so I quietly called the server over to hav
"I was a little concerned going there because the reviews weren't sounding too great. Also, I couldn't even look at the website to preview the menu because my computer's security wouldn't let me, it said their website could be ""harmful"" to my ��computer (maybe a foreshadowing?). I will say that when I walked in, I really liked the ambiance and liked that it was intimate. However, once it gets really busy, then you have waiters, busboys and patrons bumping into you the whole night because it's pretty tight. One of the reviewers I had read said their waiter had zero personality. And that's who we got. I'm not sure this should be his desired way to make a living, because he clearly didn't seem to enjoy it. The food was pretty good, nothing special, and very small quantities for the price. The b"
My first time there. we had a great lunch and it is now on a very short list of the best sushi places in Chicago!
"Some really tasty dishes. I particularly like the chargrilled octopus as a starter, and the other night I tried the roast suckling pig which was delicious. Some of the servings are a little small - but with an appetizer to share and 1/2 dishes of pasta we went home full. The waiters are always ready to lend a hand deciphering some of the oddly named dishes or to help you pick a wine for a certain dish.They can be pretty busy, so reservations are a good idea."
"I LOVE this place!! ��It's not just because of the convience, the super pleasant staff, or the fact that they have a nice flat screen for me to watch the games while I wait for my pizza. ��Their pizza is amazing...the ingredients are fresh, the dough light but tasty, and they have so much variety that my biggest issue is chosing a favorite. ��Ok...that's a lie...my favs are the brocolli and the margherita. ��Oh, and this is so much more than just pizza joint. ��Their grilled chicken, rice, beans and other sides tastes like something I would eat at a home. ��So whether I want something fast and carb-loaded or just a big salad with a side of chicken...this place ALWAYS satisfies and exceeds my expectations! ��I'm so glad I stopped in...keep up the quality and you'll have me as a customer for life. "
"My fiance and I love this place! ��It has become our Friday night hangout. ��The turkey burgers are the best in the city and they have great beers on tap. ��And we absolutely love the music and having the concerts playing on the TVs. ��HOWEVER - recently they have only been playing sports games on the TVs. ��Lockdown is not a sports bar! ��They are having an identity crisis. ��When we asked the Mgr, he said he was doing what the people want....but, how could the people possible want to not be able to hear the game on the overwhelming sound system. ��I don't want to go there ever again if all they are going to play is sports."
"Welp, finally was able to get over to Shaw's for a meal and it was so disappointing. We had the in laws in town and had bought them a gift certificate awhile back for Shaw's because they always wanted to try it (and so did we). I ordered the king crab legs, which you would expect to be BIG king crab legs and they were tiny. Plus they over cooked them! I would not expect a high end seafood place with crab house in their name to over cook crab legs but they managed. On top of that my father in law got the scallop dish and guess what? OVER COOKED! They were rubbery and even had sand grit all over them...Can't even remember what my wife got, I think it was a fish dish and she was not impressed either. The only good thing we had was Oysters Rockefeller for an appetizer...but that dish is hard t"
"It is a very unique place. Only one I know that is open so late! Food is good and so cheap! When I called them first time to make sure that they are open late, I almost did not go because the lady on the phone barely spoke English, so ��I thought that I would not be able to communicate with them, because I don't know Korean. I am glad that I decided to go. It is my favorite late night, eat-out spot!"
"This sadly is a case of the food was good, but the service was NOT.We arrived at the restaurant and received no direction on how to sit or contact a hostess and basically stood there lost along with a horde of other customers at what we thought was the hostess station. Turns out they don't even use it. You have to wander some 10 feet back to get your name on the list and people kept cutting in front of us due to the lack of order. Rude.We were then placed at a table devoid of any condiments and place settings. After we were seated the couple behind in line were seated next to us. Although we were seated first, their order was taken before ours. Rude.We ordered the Fried Wontons for an appetizer. These were not that great compared to other restaurants we have been to. For our entree, we ord"
i really enjoyed this place alot.. the first time i went there i was right away impressed with how beautifully everything was set up... ��the food tasted great and service was fabulous....i give this restaurant a high thumbs up on everything. it was perfect when i went and i cant wait for the opportunity to take my friends and family who haven't gone there!!
Came here yesterday with my husband and wow! Unlike any other restaurant. They gave us a tour of the kitchen and we saw the making behind their great food.
"I have always passed by this place but never had a chance to come in. Finally on Sunday I made a reservation and went with my husband. OMG!! The colors and vibrant vibe made me feel like I was part of the party. The staff was very nice. Noah our waiter was very nice to the both of us. Recommended the cherry margarita, which I tried. Very tasty. We had the mix ceviche. It had the right amount of lime juice and avocado slices. They give u one large piece of bread toast to eat with. Wish they would have given us another tho. We then shared the arrachera and a side dish that what seemed to be baked mastocholi with bacon bits. The rice was not that good tho, it tasted a little undercooked. But the meat was delicious and the sweet onions were awesome. My husband said it was the best arrachera he"
"Wow what a treat! Went to Big Jones on Friday night with a date, and like it so much we had to go back for Sunday Brunch!Friday we had a fixed-price menu that was very inexpensive but included morel mushrooms and tallgrass steak for the entree! It was a perfect dinner for spring and early summer. We had watercress salad, the steak with mushrooms (OMG the BEST steak I've ever had!) and some rhubarb for dessert with a cute little home made toffee. Everything was very fresh and seasonal and the service was excellent.Sunday brunch today was a whole new story. Great mimosas with good champahne were only $6.00 and the coffee was amazing (Intelligentsia.) I had Eggs New Orleans and my date had Eggs Benedict. Perfectly poached eggs, silky hollandaise sauce, and crazy yummy potatoes with onion and "
"I have never had a bad anything at Shaw's! Not a bread stick, an ice cube or a dirty look ?This place rocks! ?The Lobster Bisque ?is on my list of things to have at my last meal. The oysters are so fresh I get visions of the ocean and can feel the mist. I will be there two ?Sundays from now ?for the Hotel Brunch to celebrate my Birthday! ?I CAN NOT WAIT! The dining room is calm, serene and elegant, BUT the bar is loud and fun. ?I once entered the oyster eating contest. I did not come close to winning but how can you lose with all the oysters you can eat and a Shaw's Crab House ?tee shirt. ?I'll never do that again but I treasure the memory/"
"My husband and I were craving crepes in our new Andersonville neighborhood. We read the reviews about Icosium that basically all say good food, bad service, so we went in expecting that. The food was, indeed, delicious and reasonably priced. The service was actually terrific! Full disclosure - we went for a late lunch at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon. We were seated immediately, our order taken promptly, and the food arrived shortly thereafter. We didn't wait around for the check, but we weren't rushed out either. It was a lovely experience and we're looking forward to returning."
"Read all the positives reviews on Yelp and decided to give this place a try. It was a huge disappointment. We ordered the sausage pizza and it was terrible. Cheese tasted cheap and the meat wasn't any better. We would have been better off ordering a pizza from Little Caesars. Big disappointment, came all the way from Bridgeport for bad food."
"This is the first churrascaria I have ever been to and I was totally blown away. The restaurant is beautiful - it's massive in size and lavish in d?cor with a warm and inviting atmosphere. I immediately loved the color scheme of rich rustic red. We were seated in the middle of the dining room, right in front of the huge salad area and the wine room, which is really more like a glass wine wall! Inside, a woman in a black leotard tumbled around on a wire system getting bottles of wine while doing flips and spins, even stopping at one point to wave and smile at us. I had never seen anything like it. The service was impeccable, from our main server to the meat carvers to the managers who stopped by our table to check in on us. While we were never left unattended when needed, the service was no"
"I love this place. Great fondue, great wine choices, and has a really nice guy playing a guitar!"
Only Korean bbq that I would consider
"Had been wanting to visit this place for a long time and when I finally did, it did not disappoint. Refreshing take on vegetarian food with enough options to entice the carnivorous kinds as well. Had the reuben - Superb ! 2 thumbs up for the kale and daikon salad. I could eat it all day ! The chili was great too. The hoagie and chikun pesto panini were my less favorite dishes but good nonetheless. Very friendly staff too. Look forward to going back again !"
"Don't let the appearance from the outside fool you! It looked like a late night burrito join tto me. But my boyfriend insisted we check it out, and YUM-O! It is a little cramped inside, but once you have a few margaritas, you become friends witht the folks at your neighboring table anyway, right?!"
"one of the most memorable dining experience.old school/classic chicago.from the food to impaccable service, every thing was just great!a spot-on.It may look expensive and feel expensive.and yes it is pricey.but, in the end, it is such a bargain.best bread/pastry couse. spot on amuse-bouche.generous cheese couse.even amazing coffee!and they have by far the best dessert menu in the city.I am not a steak person, but Tru converted me.perfect for every occasion.ambience could seem little dated, but it's classy.can't go wrong with anything on the menu.wine list could use little more affordable wine though.don't forget your jacket.you will need them."
They just failed their inspection in June. I guess I won't be going here again....gross. http://chicago.everybloc��_
The korean style chicken was sooooo goood! ��also the staff was nice and they played great music!
"Poorly managed. My girlfriend and I went to Zed for Valentines Day and she ended up with Food Poisoning and out-of-work for 3 days. After emailing Zed they invited us back which they would comp our experience. After setting a date about a month after the incident, we returned and they had no recollection of the event since the executive chef had moved and hadn't forwarded the details to the managers. The night we returned the manager apologized and said she would make sure our meals were taken care of, I guess this didn't include desserts. They charged us for desserts even though my girlfriend couldn't stomach the courage to eat off their main menu due to the previous experience and only ordered a hamburger for her dinner. Very disappointing considering this is the place we originally met."
best avocado roll ever! great place for a vegan like myself. love love love
"Ok, the name sounds Japanese, but it's the best lasagna I've ever had. ��It helps to have a reservation, even on a rainy day. ��The do-it-yourself valet parking arrangement is a big plus in Lincoln Park. ��The place is often packed which distracts the wait staff , so it's hard to get out quickly, but the food is well worth the slower pace. ��Excellent personalized marketing by the chef keeps us coming back on special occasions at a discount."
"In my 27 years of dining , I have never experienced a menu that paired such modest portions of mediocre quality foods with 5 star pricing. My scallop entree was uneventful and the rest of the items we ordered, despite sounding enticing, were as interesting as watching paint dry. At over $100 a person one should expect a much more pronounced mastery of ingredients, techniques and flavors.In summary, Grahm Elliot is standard hotel fare of modest quality, served in small portions. ��In Grahm Elliot's defense the plates are artistically presented; if the taste and quality matched its appearance, they could be on to something. Unfortunately Grahm Elliot is less than what meets the eye and $100+ ��later you will remain hungry and underwhelmed."
The meat and poultry section is very good and seems to have comparable prices to Whole Foods. ��The prepared foods section is very expensive. ��Last week I bought a large container of roasted veggies - $11.00 - huh...what's up with that? ��I still prefer Whole Food's cheese and fresh produce sections over Fox and Obel's but Whole Foods is too far away so I'll have to settle.
I don't know why everyone raves about this place I thought it was so so. I was not at all blown away by the Lard Nar or the spring rolls which I found kinda soggy. ��But I have to say I do love the decor of the Restaurant and the people are nice.
"Much like several others I took a table of 10 to this place for a special occasion. ��I had been once before and that atmosphere and food were good so we decided to give it another shot. Pros: Most of the items we tried on the menu were very goodThe atmosphere - very cool and invitingCons:ServiceInability to take action and change the service experienceUnwillingness to accept responsibility for the service experienceLet me preface this by saying that I rarely complain at restaurants about the service (possibly two other times over the course of 20 years). ��In addition 90% of the review I post online are positive experiences. ��To better explain the service issue, this was a two+ hour dinner in which we were offered drinks upon arrival and once during the meal. ��Once the order was placed we o"
This place is fantastic. The beer selection is extensive and well priced. I haven't found a food item on the menu that I didn't like.
Went there opening week on a friday so it was really busy. The service was really quick even with the mass amount of people. Beer was excellent and so was the food. a couple vegan options on the menu so that was good. definatly be coming back.
"Great service: Our server really knew what he was talking about. He knew what types of fish they were serving that night (more than a dozen) and he also knew the different ingredients that made up the dish. Atmosphere: Not too trendy (which I liked), very pleasant homey feel. The seating is limited although there is an outdoor patio, but I didn't mind because you can make reservations which they promptly keep. Food: The all you can eat king crab (Tuesday nights) looked DELICIOUS. I had fish topped with mushrooms and bacon which was amazing as well. I tried a bite of the meatloaf sandwich which was seasoned perfectly and well cooked. Overall, great experience. Would go there again."
"I loved Mastro's. My husband and i came here on Tuesday for an early dinner, The service and atmosphere were wonderful, but the food was superb. We shared 2 crabcakes to start, which were very tasty. For entrees we both got the bone in ribeye with a side of lobster mash potatoes. Perfection. ��It is an expensive restaurant, but what steakhouse isn't in Chicago. Great meal and worth the cost."
i love it.
"The perfect fondue experience for a romantic evening. The lighting is low, but it isn't dark inside. The booths are nice and cozy if you manage to get one, but the tables are fine as well. The food is delicious! The salad and cheese fondue are amazing, and pretty filing. The main courses are great, and the dipping sauces add to the meal so much. By the chocolate course we were incredible full, but couldn't turn down a mouth watering chocolate fondue. And the wine list was excellent! Not a place for families or kids or even friends, but definitely a good place to celebrate something special or impress a date!"
"I seriously have no idea why people are waiting in line to get into the Frontera Grill. The drinks were super awesome, but the guacamole was so salty, I couldn't eat it. Totally not worth the 8 bucks. The duck we ordered was very tasty. But for 20 something dollars I would like to have a little bit more ��food. I would go back for drinks, but not to eat. The overall impression I had when I left was below average."
A+
"Went here last night with my wife, got a last minute reservation 1/2 hour before we wanted to eat. Busy, happening, good pulse but not crowed. Very classy and well appointed inside.We're vegetarians and we found some good eats! Beers on tap were fantastic I got a dark rich porter (so good I got 2) wife got an amber and that tasted great too. The we got a pickle and olive starter (great), grilled beat starter (fresh) salad and a risotto entree. It was an outstanding evening.Next time I'm downtown, I'll try again."
"I went to Piccolo Sogno with a very snobby foodie friend and the restaurant exceeded his expectations. ��Yay!We had made 8:30 reservation on Thursday night but decided to show up an hour before because we were starving. The hostess was very understanding and sat us within 15 minutes. We also run into a friend's father who paid for our drinks at the bar. Another Yay! So, just like that the restaurant was full of sophisticated Chicagoans with an old world charm. ��The waiter, an older Italian man with a heavy Italian accent, absolutely took care of us. The food and the wine was what you would expect from the former chefs at Coco Pazzo. Great place to charm a date. Absolutely have to go next door for a desert cigar!"
"My boyfriend and I came here to avail a coupon that seems to be pretty popular among its clients. Even with that coupon I did not think the food was worth it. The meat is very low grade so yes, it is all you can eat but why would you want to stuff yourself with low grade meats. I had the tuna which made me gag, he had the chicken which he said was dry, and he had the beef which he said was very tough. The only thing he enjoyed were the lamb chops. The service from the servers was nice but I found the ma��tre d to be obnoxious and overbearing. I wanted my tip to go to the hardworking servers, not some old jackass who just sat around dishing out ""I AM WATCHING YOU"" stares at the staff while waiting to pick up tips like a vulture. ��Overall the experience was a disappointment. We felt rushed an"
"I like the regular dogs, my brother loves the more exoctic dougs.Gotta try it at least once!"
"My most favorite chinese restaurant in the whole wide world, need i say more??? *winks*The Owner, Tony, just open up another restaurant, Lao Beijing, do try the House style Fish, my new fave!!!"
"Listen, Doug seems like a really nice guy, BUT, well, in a word (or two) the food is greasy, greasy gross. And expensive. And the atmosphere, well, if you like lots of fat people stuffing french fries in their mouths while unsuccessfully attempting to stifle belches -- it's great! I'm sorry but this place is way over-rated. Not so HOT after all. One star."
"The staff was very friendly. ��They even went out of their way to make a dish for me that was not on the menu, and it was amazing! ��The violinist/guitarist music was hard to take, but A+ for the effort. �� I will go there again."
"4 stars due to the overbooking. ��Why have reservations if you're overbooked and running an hour behind? ��That's the huge downside!However, the food is to DIE for, so it's worth the wait every once in awhile. ��The prices are very fair and the atmosphere is nice....You will also get a free appetizer (pizza bread) but it's a nice touch while you wait. ��The portions are huge, you will get soup, salad and a pasta dish with your meal..I can almost taste it right now. ��If you're going to make the trip, go early and don't bring the kiddos..it's not kid friendly at all. ��You'll be glad you went"
"While all of our former favorite sushi places are going downhill, the quality and freshness at Wakamono is consistent and strong. ��That's what we crave in our sushi -- predictably fresh and tasty. ��We used to be Bob San loyalists, but Wakamono has won us over...we only wish they delivered south of Division (pretty please, we are only a few blocks south)!"
"As a person who went to callege at Tulane and bummed around NOLA for some time after, I was keenly interested when I ran into Big Jones at the Green City Market benefit at Red Light. There they had an awesome succotash and a peach cobbler so good Mother's would have been humbled had the old lady been able to take a taste.  �� We followed up by going to dinner last night and had fried chicken. Wow what great chicken. Crispy with a real bite to the meat. You could tell that the chickens got to run around a lot and got plenty of excercise. Cornbread: JUST LIKE down south. White cornmeal and not sweet. It could have used more crunch around the outside though. �� ��Mississippi mud pie: Holy Wonka WOW! That was the richest thing I've ever eaten by far. �� The service was warm and friendly just like "
"We came on a Sunday afternoon. Not too crowded, we sat at the bar ordered apps and the home brews. Food was good, fresh, well above average. The beers were fantastic. We each had 2 pints, and then brought home a growler of Eugene Porter to share with friends.Service- top notch. All of the gals that worked behind the bar were on top of it, and friendly.This was a perfect afternoon treat. We will be back."
"Wow! ��This restaurant compelled me to write my first Yelp review. ��This has to have been the best restaurant experience I've had in a long time. ��When we arrived, there was a wait and I wasn't sure where the host or line was, but the owner got us water while we waited and I bought a kiwi-strawberry smoothie from the juice bar. ��We agreed that we'd take the bus to Simply It for the smoothie alone. ��We were seated after about 10/15 minutes (on a Saturday night without reservations). ��We agreed upon the shrimp papaya salad, chicken avocado appetizer, Bamboo Duck, and Grilled Salmon Noodles. ��The shrimp papaya salad was refreshing with a bit of a spicy kick. ��The chicken--how did they make that chicken so perfectly crispy? ��The mango salsa was a nice compliment to the avocado stuffed chicken. "
"Sat at the bar... total bill with wine for 2, under $100. More casual than I expected (which is a good thing), food was excellent, everything from the anchovies to risotto. We got lucky and got a seat at the bar without a wait , which was also nice. Without a doubt it would have been 5 stars, but the best part about sitting at the bar is the interaction with the bartender and ours just had nothing to her. The bar back was great--wish he got our tip!"
Great courtyard ��patio . Good italian food ! My favorite for outdoor dining.
"Rick Bayless, I don't get it! ��Went to Xoco right before lunch on a Saturday. ��We had to wait to order tortas until 11:00, so we decided to have some chocolate and churros. ��I also decided to have an empanada while waiting. ��The chocolate with almond milk had a little too much almond flavoring in it, otherwise it was OK. ��The empanda tasted Ok and would have been much better had it not been icy cold in the center.On to the tortas. ��Ordered both a chicken and a short rib torta. ��We were sitting right at the end of the serving line where the sous chef ��gives the food to the servers. ��Prior to recieving my torta my wife turned to me and said I was not going to like my order. ��Just then the food arrived. ��I looked down on my torta and it was not slightly burnt but black. ��I looked at my wife a"
"This is not a bad review regarding the food, it is however bad for the manager on duty this evening 8/29/12. I ordered food at 6:35 and at 7:44 called to see where my delivery was.... well the man on the phone said the food just left and it was only ordered 39 minutes ago. ��You can clearly see that 6:35 to 7:44 is not 39 minutes. ��When I called back to say that I do not appreciate being lied to the same man on the phone said that is what his Manager told him to tell me. ��Bad business practice. ��Will most likely not order from them again. ��Sad because they do have really good food."
"Best Chicken wings in chicago, maybe further out than that."
"The selection of microbrews is terrific but the pizza is inspired. Except for Pepe's and Modern this place ranks with best in New Haven. You go ,guys!"
"Excellent food, good atmosphere, friendly service. Worth the money, worth the wait, lives up to the hype."
great pizza!!! went there for lunch today and fell in love with the crust everyone talks about. maybe had a beer too many on my lunch break but hey... don't judge me!
"Incredible selection of some of the best beer around, great food, buzzing crowd and surly waitstaff--what more could you want in a neighborhood bar? ��A FEW TIPS OTHERS HAVE MISSED:-The 2nd floor dining room is a bit more secluded and suitable for conversation if you can get it.-If you're into beer, be sure to ask for the FULL menu, not the mini-menu that you get at the table. Well over one hundred beers...Belgians of course just waiting to be tried-Mussels are their specialty--get them in the Belgian beer sauce, and ask for extra bread-The lamb stew puts any other lamb stew in this city to shameRECOMMENDED BEERS (SOME OF MY FAVORITES)Draft_________________Leffe Blonde (as appetizer)Gouden Carolus (w/ entree)Our Beersel (for dessert)Bottles________________Atomium Premier Gran CruGulden Drak"
"It's ok for a tourist trap. Though, there are soooo many other places I'd recommend for great pizza in the city over this place. Like the ""Lou"" at Lou Malnati's, or Bacino's in Lincoln Park. Or what about caponies over on Harlem by the HIP?"

"I had heard the food was really good, but I am pretty picky when I go out to dinner, so I decided to try it out first for lunch. ��I went on Saturday and loved my food, the atmosphere and the service. ��I got the Lobster Salad Sandwich, which I must admit, I was hesitant to get it (because I am really picky with my seafood), but it was great!!! ��My friend had the turkey burger (which I of course tried) and loved it. ��I will definitely be going back there for dinner :)I am going to try out the drinks tomorrow night and will give an update on the nightlife..."
They have the BEST Clementini's! I highly suggest that everyone go get one soon:)
"I LOVE this place. ��It is by far one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city. ��The staff isn't the friendliest but it's okay because I don't go there for the service, I go there for the sushi!Their Godzilla roll is a guilty pleasure of mine. ��It's technically not really sushi, it doesn't have anything raw in it! ��It's just shrimp tempura, crab, some eel sauce and some other sauces...and avocado I think? ��Anyways, it's delicious and you should try it.I also love their tuna sampler platter that they have where you get Fatty Tuna, Maguro, and White Tuna. ��It's nice to taste them side by side and good for people who don't know the difference. ��I personally find the white tuna the best. ��It's creamy and the fish always seems to be fresh here.I also tried their Mexican roll which I thought "
Quality food at a great value.Salad bar is always fresh/stocked and the service is very friendly. The spicy falafel is amazing.
The Green Mill is an unpretentious world class venue where you can see great jazz and don't have to visit the ATM machine before you enter.People here are into music and you don't have to deal with a glorified yuppie environment.The drinks are old school and aren't watered down.I have enjoyed every event attended there.
"The suburban crowd apparently did not take to this concept so why is it in the city? The decor is cozy and modern chalet-esque but the food, drinks are service do not live up to the location and appearance. The staff are borderline polite (it's apparently a cool place to be so I guess you are ""lucky"" to get in!), the food although not bad is just average and the only redeeming factor is the roof terrace (again, it can be tough to get up there if you don't arrive early). This is not a place that I recommend at all. Perhaps the downtown location's fate will closely follow that of the suburban location."
"i find this place ok, you can find places like these all over the south side and a hella cheaper. The line thing and seating is crazy, now don't get me wrong the place has good food-but why wait for it! Im telling you good hot dogs in the city are not hard to find- so i dont wait in line!!!!"
"I was very excited about this restaurant. It has a great decoration and atmosphere, but I was completely disappointed by the food. I think it's the worst food I had in the city. I don't understand how they could screw up every single dish they prepared. If they fire the chef and turn htings around I may go back, but as long as they have their same chef, I will never go there again."
"AMAZING is the only word for this place. the eggs benedict is the BEST IN THE CITY. Fresh juices are great but a bit overpriced. The coffee is delicious, and the atmosphere, although tight, is quaint. My fav bfast spot in the city"

"Waitress who took our order apparently went off shift as we never saw here again. Food came out in stages, not all at once. Forgot to bring rice we ordered. We requested chicken dish prepared mild. It came out late. Too spicy to eat. When I asked how it was prepared I was told it was prepared extra hot. Then told No, that is how we prepare it mild. After some checking in the kitchen, there was an apology and an offer of a beer on the house. The couple at the next table also complained about something screwed up in their order. The other dishes were nothing special. Maybe it was an off night, but it looks to me like this place is resting on its laurels. Won't be back."
"Excellent food, but be prepared to wait. Or get it to go! Either way this is excellent new age Mexican Cousine."
"I had my bridal shower at Spacca and I have to say they were wonderful! ��Jonathan is very helpful, and really knows what he's talking about. ��The staff on the day was amazing and sweet, so great. ��The food, of course, is amazing!! ��I can't recommend this place enough to anyone, it is awesome!!!! ��They really want there customers to be happy."
"indie used to be a reliable favorite---though delivery times were always inconsistent, ranging from super short to super long, the green curry, edamame and gom-e were excellent. not sure if they've gotten too busy of late, or maybe our honeymoon phase is just over, but lately the food has been kind of hit or miss (especially the gom-e). come on indie, why can't it be like it was when we first met?"
"I first came to Zed 451 shortly after it had opened on a date. ��I loved the food then and I continue to love the food and service.What I particularly want to comment on is my experience of having my wedding and reception there. ��My husband and I were consistently impressed and happy to find that not only did Zed have wonderful food to serve our guests and a gorgeous event room for the wedding and reception to take place in, but also provided wonderful and thoughtful service. ��We felt like Sammy, the event coordinator, viewed our special day as being important to her and the staff. ��I can't say how much it meant to us to feel that the people we were working with cared that the event went off smoothly and nicely. ��Everyone at the wedding raved about the food, of course. ��The pricing for usin"
"i live just a couple blocks away from this place, and i love it so much i've actually had to make an effort to go there less. i just started yelping today, and ��this is the first place i could think of. the people who work at sultan's are cool and nice and super quick (though there's one lady there who likes to talk on the phone and take her time which gives me the impression that she's in charge or something---still not bad, just not as responsive as the others). i work nights, so i usually go in a post-work daze pretty soon after they open at 10.their falafel is fantastic and very well priced. their salad bar is so good and, again, well priced. their baklava is super tasty. their meat stuff looks good, but i never get it for some reason---my friends say it's good, too. then, when you go "
Really disappointing. We stopped in after a night of Christmas shopping and looking at the lights downtown. ��The waiter was almost non-existent (water glasses sat empty after the first 5 minutes) and he even stopped while taking our order to join in a conversation at the next table about living in Michigan. ��Food was not worth the price and the atmosphere wasn't anything special. Won't go back.
"Authentic, flavorful Algerian savory and dessert crepes, wonderful soups, fresh OJ and fresh roasted organic coffee.Ingredients are fresh, the lamb sausage wonderful.It was in the crepe i ordered with sauted multicolored peppers and goat cheese. Nicely decorated corner storefront, so natural lighting in the day timeand you get to feel the hustle and bustle of Andersonville.The wait staff are polite and professional.I have been there for a casual lunch as well as a small family graduation celebration....they are accommodating, you can turn it intowhatever level of formality you want.Great place to take out of town guests for the food as well as the ease of sitting, talking and getting waited on professionally, for reasonable prices."
I sat in a banquet room away from the restaurant. ��It was terrible. ��The service was good but it was not worth the money. ��The food was okay but there was not enough to taste for one person.
"Instead of making this a creative writing assignment, I'm going to make this short and sweet. �� ��I had a craving for Pho and didn't want to hike up to Argyle. ��The entry at first looks like it's just a hole in the wall, but surprised to find a very cozy dining room to the left. �� We were greeted with complimentary ginger tea, great meal and served complimentary fresh fruit and sweet rice cake. ��The host/owner was sweet and endearing. ��I will definitely come back!"
"Loved my experience, I recommend the saganaki, eggplant, and zucchini!"
"So I have only been here a couple times for lunch, and its my fave spot for Chicago pizza. The pan pizza with the caramelized crust was pretty damn good! Toppings were fresh, great selections of drinks, and good customer service! Also, Webster Theater is right there, so if I want some good pizza before a movie or even after, Pequod's is the place to go!!!"
"There's something about eating spicy food, having live fire in your face, and drinking beer that brings out an appetite. Relish it here along with a million little plates of unknown condiments and sides. Also helps to love kim chee. The service was ok, but to be fair after our table was served with giant beers, raw meat and a fire , there wasn't much to do except roll us out the door afterwards."
"A true Chicago landmark, Ive been a fan of this place for over 30 years. Food, Food, and more Food. Wine, Wine and more Wine. If you like Greek food, this is the place in the middle of Chicago's Greek town."
"This place is awesome! Have to say I was in between a 4 and 5. Ended at a 4 because the atmosphere is a bit lacking. That said the service and food are great and the price can not be beat. On Tuesday's and Wednesday's they have a phenomenal deal where you get a multi course meal for $12.50 per person. The food tastes super fresh, seems healthy, and you get to try a bit of everything. I highly suggest Simply It if you are going out for a casual meal and you want really good quality food at a great price with super friendly service."
"I'm pretty much done with Pequod's & it isn't even about their pizza. ?Although the pizza is good, the customer service is horrendous & I refuse to pay that much money for pizza only to be treated poorly. ?My work department placed an order yesterday for a noon delivery today. ?The delivery guy showed up 35 minutes early. When I asked why he was so early he said I'm here now so you can pay for the pizza or I can leave. Wow, great customer service! ?He only got more irritated and rude when we asked if we could call the manager to find out what happened. ?The manager was also extremely rude and offered no apologies whatsoever. He did offer a discount for our next order but we explained that our company was moving out of the neighborhood next weekend so there would not be a next time. ?He did"
"I've been here a few times and always had a good time(the BYOB helps). Sitting in the patio area is well worth and a great people watching atmosphere. We always had above average service, and I'd have to agree with a lot of the other comments--The Veggie Burritos are amazing!!"
Wonderful food. I especially love the fries in goose fat!
"In April I bought two groupons for Fox and Obel (spend $20, get $40 worth of groceries). I mainly got the groupons because even though in my opinion the prices and service is better at Whole Foods and Trader Joes, sometimes I'm lazy or it is raining and Fox and Obel is right down the street. Anyway, back to my recent experience. I used the first groupon in late April. I tried to use the second one on Sunday, as it expires today. After the cashier rang up my order I handed him by groupon and he went to the front desk area to talk to some guy (never got his name). He came back and had written two dates on the groupon - one was in April and the other was October 10th. He said that the groupon had been used twice - on the dates that he had written down. I wasn't even in town on October 10th. I"
"I'm torn on this place. ��I have come here about once a week for the last year so obviously I am a fan of the food. The menu is pretty good, what you order is usually great, and the prices are certainly fair. ��The real issue and reason for giving it 3 stars is the service which is sometimes comically bad. The issue is beyond having to flag down a waitress, I have on occasion ordered coffee more than three times before getting it. If your entree comes with soup, there is a 30% chance that it is going to be forgotten entirely. ��Having been a regular for a while now, I have noticed that most waitresses don't stick around for more than a few months-which I think is probably pretty average for the industry, but it seems like they don't really get any training at all before being sent out on the "
"The meat, the essence of Brazilian steak houses, is good and diverse. ��The lamb was very good. The beef was good too. The bread they give you at the beginning is AMAZING. Don't eat too much or you won't be able to enjoy the rest of the food! The salad bar (or salad and side bar) was good. However, the one at Texas de Brazil is better. The service was great with bringing ��meat around quickly. Our waiter was very friendly and also helped with wine choices. However, ��they did the whole awkward Brazilian steakhouse thing where they take away your 'salad' plate and just won't let you eat meat as the same time as anything from the sides and salad bar (which had sides like potatoes and more).The atmosphere is ok. The tables feel very crowded in the weekends or busy evenings, especially if there a"

Its really hard to get a table on the weekend if you don't have reso's. but this place is so amazing! ��I love their pecking duck and the combo meal... such a great value. ��I even love their little to-go kitchen they have. ��The chinese bbq pork is sooo good!
Cory approved.
"ARE YOU HUNGRY? In the mood for yummy satisfying food to fill the void in an empty stomach?picking the lint out of your pocket book?GO TO SULTANS!!! delicious and cheap!The Falafal is one of the best ive ever had, the lentil soup warm and lovely. I would recommend getting the Falafal spicey, it leaves a warm tingle on the lips without overpowering the delicious taste that exists in and of itself... go there.. enjoy!"
"What an amazing treat! ��Some really incredible sushi and combinations that truly tantalized the tastebuds. ��Watermelon that is carmelized and topped with unagi - incredible! ��Sunda also had an incredible saki selection - try the Green Ridge - bursted with apples and complemented our plates phenomenally. ��Remember to save room for dessert - highly recommend the ""Ridiculous"". ��So many selections that our server (Choo) helped us with some great tastings!! ��Definitely will go back - just need to save up for the next special occasion."
Go hungry! Love dipping the fruit and meat in the fondu. So yummy. Don't go for a first date because it is extremely romantic!

"I went to Xoco for the first time yesterday, expecting to battle long lines and longer waits. ��I thought I was lucky that I only had to wait 20 minutes -- my wait at Frontera last time was just under 5 hours. ��No joke.I see why the wait here is short(er). ��The food, while good, is overpriced and overhyped. ��My partner and I got guacamole, a soup, a sandwich, a cookie, and a hot chocolate. ��Total bill: $35.First off, that's a pretty stiff bill for a simple dinner for two. ��The soup (the chicken one) was super salty. ��The sandwich (jamon torta) was just ok, but nothing special. ��The guacamole was pretty small and delicious -- but kind of pricey at $4. ��The chocolate chip hazelnut cookie was ridiculously good.And the hot chocolate? ��I was so disappointed. ��I got the Aztec, which is chocolate,"
"After living in Bucktown for awile I decieded to try this Costa Rican resturant.. The only one in Chicago.. ��:-( �� ��So I had to try it .. First of all Its a long wait. This place is small . You would think with all the buisness they have they would expand. So they turned thier parking lot into a outdoor patio. Still a long wait, and Is this even legal. Is it so thier property taxes do not go up. They do not take credit cards, but they have a ATM right there. Another way to make money from you, and screw the IRS too. You get charged a fee that they make out of it. Now thier prices are high for Costa rican food. ��I dont respect buisnesses that do this. Its a way to take your hard working money from you. Now for the food. The oatmeal drink is a latin thing. I drink it every morning when im in"

"I can honestly say this is one of the worst restaurants and most frustrating places that I have ever been to in Chicago. ��The food wasn't bad however good luck trying to get any and not too many choices. ��Understaffed but some of waiters were nice an apologetic cause they probably see the problems first hand, yet there are a number of bad attitudes in there which makes it hard to enjoy the atmosphere be it that it is nice. ��I'll give them the nice roof deck. ��If you plan on going, plan on waiting, waiting and waiting for bad service and food that is okay but not very much selection and at times cold. ��No good cuts of meat really either. ��Don't waste your time or money. ��My first and probably last review, not my style really but thought it was appropriate here."
"I tried it twice to be sure, the place has great burgers! ��If your considering them don't think twice other wise you'll miss some great food. Mac and cheese is great too but I prefer the hand cut fries. Onion rings aren't great unless you like the Frenches style, hard to pick up and dip in the ranch dressing. Stick to the burgers, fries, and Mac and cheese and you will never be disappointed! ��Get there early though seating is limited and fills up fast!"

"When in a major city for a work obligation...make it count! ��That is just what I did in going to TRU. ��I enjoyed the Grand Collection, which was superb! ��My favorites were the farm ricotta and corn agnolotti with burgundy truffle consomme and the glazed veal ribeye with spring garlic, asparagus and wild mushrooms. ��I allowed the sommelier to pair my courses. ��The Knoll Riesling was incredible. ��I am very pleased that I added the cheese course, which was perfect.I enjoyed watching the impeccable simultaneous service for parties larger than just one...which I was...just one. ��As a lone diner it would have been lovely if the staff had of broken character a bit and been more personable, ��but they were efficient and friendly...to a point. ��I felt comfortable enough to have enjoyed myself immens"
"My wife and I just ate here last week for the first time. ��It is a really nice place to eat! ��The portions were very sizable, as I would expect from an Italian restaurant, and the price was actually quite affordable. ��I had ravioli, which was outstanding.They seem to have a pretty extensive wine list for those who are interested. ��Overall, it was a very satisfying dining experience. ��The wait staff was friendly, and residential parking was ample within a block, not to mention they offer valet service if you choose that route. We'll definitely go there again."
good food
"I love love LOVED 90 Miles! Went there with my boyfriend a few weeks ago without ever hearing anything about it, I just pass it everyday going to work and thought it looked interesting. ��Such a fun atmosphere...outdoor seating that's always packed, tiki torches, good music, and best of all, BYOB. ��We weren't aware of this our first trip, but we're determined to go back. ��Also, the prices are unbeatable. ��We order 3 appetizers, split their most expensive entree, dessert, coffee, and drinks, all for under $50. ��Everything was delicious, but I especially recommend the cheese and guava empanada as well as the coconut flan. ��SO GOOD! I can't wait to go back and try more things off the menu."
"LOVE this neighborhood gem! ��Friendly staff, cozy ambiance, and absolutely delicious food! ��I am completely addicted to the pumkin ravioli, and have a very hard time NOT picking it and enjoying the rest of the menu- but its worth it, because the Lobster Ravioli is out of this world... and the veal knocks my socks off... and the gnocchi... and the ribs... and the pastas... and the... well, you get the point..."

The man is a genius and it shows on every plate."
"In the city where hot dogs are king (except for those who use ketchup), Hot Doug's is the Buckingham Palace. ��Not only can you enjoy the standard hot dog choices, but Doug has opened up a exciting world of exotic encased meats that delights all the senses. ��And the buns are always fresh. ��The only problem with Hot Doug's is that I moved 10 miles away from it."
This is a great date restaurant and the staff are very polite. Our waiter gave us suggestions on food and wine and all of his suggestions were fantastic.
Irazu is the best! I'm not vegetarian but I have vegetarian friends from out of town and when they visited Chicago they had irazu on their list of places to hit. They're from Philadelphia and and they knew of it through some vegetarian enthusiasts website. I love the food there though
"My partner and I have dined here several times over the course of the last year and every visit proves itself as why we keep returning. Great food, whether you're in the mood for something casual like pizza or for something a bit more full flavored such as steaks, chicken, or pastas. Everyone in our most recent party enjoyed their meals - black scallions, filet mignon, chicken alfredo, and the skirt steaks were the dishes ordered, all receiving nothing but praise. One thing that could change? The tacky live pianist who butchers a many classics with his homage to bad karaoke."
"Food is below mediocre and over priced. ?The manager is offensive and ?ignorant. The other waiters are attentive at times, and not attentive at other times. desert is not terribly pleasant. The atmosphere, interior decor as far as Ethiopian restaurants in chicago go, is probably the best.Food: ?Every time I have been I get served plates of flavorless mush that taste pretty much the same. Incredibly unpalatable. ?Veggie combo--flavorless mush. ?Doro wot--again flavorless curry with chucks of equally flavorless chicken. ?If this wasn't served to me as ethiopian food, my taste buds would probably not recognize it as such.Also, the manager was ignorant. ?Despite ranting on and on and on about how we should try the african veg combo and how there was an african band playing later, I'm pretty su"
"Delicious food, totally amazing atmosphere. Wilde used to be an old Baroque library. When converted to a restaurant, the decor stayed. Beautiful atmosphere. The food is a little pricey, but food is very rich and filling. I recommend the macaroni and cheese (not your mom's old macaroni and cheese, I tell ya) and the lemon half-chicken. Amazing.A wonderful place for date night, a very romantic place. However, go there with friends too. Very fun. However, not a place to go if you need a place to talk, it's very loud and darkly lit."

"I came here on a field trip for my Middle Eastern History class and really enjoyed it. Contrary to what I thought, there were a lot of vegetarian options for me, all of which were really great. There were a variety of dished covering all the food groups: grain, fruits, vegetables, dairy, protein, and of course, sweets. Noon O Kabab seemed quite authentic and had an entheusaism for middle eastern food."
This is a fun place with really good food. ��I personally think it's a bit pricey for what you get. ��But the food was really delicious. ��For what you pay... it better be!

I love this Burrito more than any single food item in the city of Chicago. The steak is just as it should be. It's medium, juicy and bursts with natural flavor. The pico de gallo is so fresh it could've been picked right out of their back garden. Everything comes together in spectacular fashion.If you haven't tried the carne asada burrito at Garcias, well..."
Carnivale was fantastic. �� You have to wait to be able to sit in the main restaurant. ��Don't take a quick table at the bar. ��The ambiance is unbelievable. ��I wish I could decorate my house that way. ��All of the food was very good. ��A+ place.
"I've eaten here several times. Yesterday I was walking by, the menue looked new and I went in.As ;I hve some food restrictions I asked the waitress some questins about the food. She answered them and I said I'll think about it. I then asked if I could use their bathroom, which was no problem. Afterwards I sat down at a table and waited to order. When the waitress came I asked what was in the soup. I have it several times and live it, but now may not be able to eat it. As i was getting ready to order the owner or manager came over and asked me to leave. He said I was playing games and he didn't like it. I told him I wasn't, but I would gladly.As I was getting ready to leave he movjked his hands in a motion that meant go. I couldn't believe this. Needless to say I won't go back to this place"
the cuban sandwich and yuka was incredable. great atmosphere and service ��nice decor and music ��must go....
This place honestly has the best chicken I have ever eaten. ��Great ambience and easy valet parking. ��Awesome food. thanks will be back again
This has got to be one of the WORST places I have eaten in Chicago.. So much so that I had to create an account to tell about it.We were told that the food was good but the service was lacking... Little did we know.We were sat outside which was nice. About 20 min later we finally ��got a waitress to take our order. About 45min later we got our food. My Cuban sandwich was small and had large pieces of wax paper in the melted cheese. The banana chips that came with the meal. Well there were only 4 yes 4 of them on the plate. About 15 min later our server came out with our drinks and asked how our food was. I informed her that we hadnt recieved our apps yet OR our DRINKS. She blamed another server for taking them and said she would go get ours. She brought our drinks and then after we were all
"This place knocked my socks off on Saturday night with an amazing meal. ��The veal was on special and it was the best I have ever had. ��This place is the real deal and the atmosphere is perfect with a small group of friends. ��Get there early, though, as the place fills up if you want to hang out at the bar first."
"This is the original, and yes I cant say enough of the chocolate malt. Just enough to want you to want another. There hot dogs are of course gigantic and made just for them. You've seen this place on the food network channel so you know the rest."
"Yes this is a ONE-star rating.I am chinese and I used to love this resturant.I always give 20% tips but this time I gave them 0. What's more I'll never return to Lao Sze Chuan for anything.In the old days while the owner of Lao Sze Chuan was in the resturant, service was good and taste was nice authentic. My friends and I always chose Lao Sze Chuan as a 1st place for dinner.Things changed, the owner seldomly appear in the resturant and I see new faces of waiters. Price went up but I considered the taste could be better.I was horribly wrong. I went to O'hare today to pick up my classmate and went to Lao Sze Chuan for dinner. One waiter sent us glasses of water was just hanging glasses in his hand over the table, waiting us, customers to place glasses without any sentence. We are 5 people gr"
"Hands down fantastic! ��Each beer tasted wonderful. ��There is a beer for everyone's taste. ��The food was gourmet. ��From the awesome chicken & bacon pizza, to the mussels to the burger. Everything was prepared perfectly. ��I even received a true medium rare burger. ��It was super busy on opening night, but the staff maintained their cool and hustled as quick as they could. ��The atmosphere was casual and fun. ��The space is huge. I can't wait to go back on a less crowded night and really check the place out."
"Simply It is absolutely my favorite restaurant in Chicago. You cannot beat the price, the respectful staff, and especially the great meals you receive here. My favorite thing about this place is the lunch special. For such a small price you get so much great, gourmet food! It is also great for dinner. In the evening it is a great atmosphere with soft music and candle-lit tables. The owner, Tuan Nguyen, is always around making sure everything is perfect. You can definitely tell that this restaurant is his passion by the way he takes care of it and takes care of his customers! Once you give this restaurant a try, you will want to go again and again."
We went too this restaurant tonight and I had the most embarrasing time of my life. ?I have never reviewed a resturant. ?I have had some bad meals and some good meals. ?I cannot say that my problem was with the meal or for that matter with the particular young man that helped us. ?But with the establishment as a whole and the philosophy of the place. ?Our bill for two came out to $76+. ?Kind of hefty for a mid week chinese meal. ?But then again this is not a problem either. ?OK so here is the problem. ?We ordered some appetizers and then we ordered the main dish the Hot Pot. ?They brought the food to the table and we thought that at $16.95 per person the food they brought us belonged to us. ?But no only the food you eat is yours. ?Yes the fine print on the menu says that you cannot take aw
This place is great. ��The environment is amazing. ��The waiter was very patient with our group as we waited for other people in our party to show up. The owner is great. He really knows how to run a classy establishment. Simple menu and delicious food. I'm thinking about becoming a regular.Go there and go there often!
"Opened in 1962 by the Gutierrez family, Nuevo Leon offers a wide variety of authentic Mexican dishes that are sure to please anyone. Their menu is well balanced with choices of flavorful chichen, steak, and seafood dishes as well as many other traditional Mexican meals. If you like an appetizer before you main course, I suggest their flavorful QUESO CON CHORIZO. This wonderful dish sports chihuahua cheese cooked with onions, tomatoes, jalapeno peppers topped with their homemade mexican sausage, served on a hot plate with fresh flour tortilla chips. There is a lot to choose from for your main course. The BURRITO DE CARNE ASADA is fantastic and FLAUTAS DE POLLO will make your taste buds go wild! For desert, you must try their FLAN; its tasty and original and some of the best I've ever had. I"
"I feel a little intimidated to even write a review about this place. I truly believe it is one of the greatest places (perhaps THE greatest) place to get food in Chicago.Don't let the line that wraps around the place turn you away. Bring a book or something, because the wait is WORTH IT!I love that the owner, Doug, takes every person's order.I love that they change their specials frequently- it keeps me coming back for new things to try and for some reason makes me think the food is fresher.I love the quirky, non-threatening atmosphere.Ask for Doug's recommendation, and he will probably tell you to get the Foie Gras and Sauternes Duck Sausage with Truffle Aioli and the Foie Gras Mousse. It is incredible. But the other specials have always been just as mouth-watering.My advice, go with a bu"
"I usually avoid Italian places because I am a vegan for health reasons and talk about temptation alley .... Italian food is hard to enjoy without all the cream and cheese and butter and meat and ... well, you get the idea.We were invited to go with a group of people so I couldn't say no. ��When we walked in, immediately we were greeted with smiling friendly faces. The front room is so beautiful. It is quaint, comfortable, elegant and not too stuffy. It feels like a neighborhood Italian place should feel ... like home.And since I am a sucker for great ambiance and don't expect Italians to know what to do with my eating restrictions, I was happy with a great little glass of wine and my company. ��I truly did not expect to eat more than maybe the bread ... boy was I wrong.The waiter was excepti"

"you dont go here for the food, you go for the look of the place and the cool-factor. It doesnt dissappoint. Feels like you're back in the 50's. Good dogs, good fries."
"My failed attempt at dinner at Piccolo Sogno was the worst dining experience I've ever had in Chicago. ��The staff was inattentive and rude. ��I had called in advance to see if it was possible to reserve a table in their courtyard and I was assured it was. ��Upon arriving, I found out that they do not reserve tables outside and I would have to wait, despite having a reservation. ��When I mentioned that I was assured a table outside by the woman I spoke to on the phone, the hostess told me I was mistaken, and I was immediately brushed off. ��Despite this initial disappointment we decided to get a drink at the bar and wait. ��After being ignored for 15 minutes at the bar by all 4 bartenders, I decided to abandon the drinks and return to the waiting area. ��While waiting, I spoke with another couple"
"I wouldn't come here for basic cheap staples (eggs and milk) unless you want eggs that have been given a K-5 education out of a rustic Amish farmhouse and milk that has been slowly milked by fair Swedish maidens in the highlands from rare golden cows. (Although both sound delicious if you have money to burn). Their cafe is delightful and delicious, their breads are in a league of their own, and the wall of olive oils are fun to try. Over the years of living next door, I have built a list of ""musts"" if you are trying food from F&O. Their soups are all delicious, their grilled cheese and tomato soup combo is pretty affordable, their chocolate chip cookies are chewy and caramelized because of the copious amounts of butter and sugar (YUM). They have a nice beer selection, good olive oils and f"
"Food is excellent. For apps, I highly recommend the Brussels Sprout Salad. I've never eaten Brussels Sprouts in my life until I had this and it was worth the wait. The dressing is sweet and spicy. The Ox Tail pot stickers are great too. Everything on the menu is delightful. Enjoy!"
"w -- I went here and had the 24 course meal. ��Holy crap is that a lot of food even though each course is a bite or two.Here's a piece of advice, don't down a bottle of champagne with your friend before you get here -- I made that mistake and was pretty tipsy -- asking the waiter (who I'm SURE hated me) if every course was an 'amuse bouche'. The food was very unique and delicious. ��If I were to go back, I'd get the 12 course -- 24 was way too much for me. ��Also, if you don't like white wine (I personally hate it) -- don't get the wine pairing. ��Most of it was white wine and therefore I didn't drink most of it. The decor is really cool and while waiting for my friend to use the restroom before we left I got to watch the kitchen staff running around the kitchen like a well oiled machine. Love"
"This place is fine, not great, not terrible. ��Watch out for the after work crowd, it is full of the hippie-type bankers. ��Much better and diverse on the weekends."
"Irazu's is not effing around when it comes to delicious Costa Rican cuisine! I was highly impressed with everything I've ever ordered. The empanada's, the guac, and the horchata were all muy delicioso!Every time, I go I stop at Red+White Wine store (right across the street)and pick up a bottle of Spanish red to enjoy with my meal. It's BYOB and the perfect place to sit out on the patio and enjoy a wonderful, affordable, filling meal. My only complaint is that it's small and it's cash only, so don't forget to stop at the ATM beforehand. You will not won't be disappointed."
"Finally visited Coast because it was Sunday.This place is ridiculous to get into on a Friday or Saturday.That being said, I figured the sushi would be mind blowing....It was just OK. The sushi was average and the wait staff was overwhelmed.Not worth the 2+ hour wait on a weekend."
Great Food
"I went to this steakhouse with my company. We were placed in the private dining area. The service here was so great, we met the entire staff including the manager Kelly. The customer service was the best I had ever received. The Steak was amazing, but the sides are even better. If you are in the Chicagoland area, you should definitely pay the place a visit.."
"I went in with much anticipation due to the gushing of the masses. ��I stopped in on a Thursday evening around 8 pm, to find a line and a slight wait until a table was ready (inefficient). ��Similar to other less-than-impressed reviews:DECOR 4LAYOUT 3 (awkward)SERVICE 7FOOD 4 (see below)My friend and I ordered the Carnitas soup, the Ahodaga torta, guac / chips and the Mexican hot chocolate. ��Unlike street food in Mexico, these prices are not reasonable or representative of anything other than what Rick Bayless can charge in downtown Chicago. ��$11.50 for a bowl of soup ... need I say more!!GOOD: ��there are some interesting flavor notes. ��The chocolate was thick and rich. ��Guac & chips ... perfect and proven.BAD: ��SALT, SALT and more SALT in both soup and tortas. ��I had two sips of soup and sh"
"I went here with Mike K. for a little Sunday night noshing. Though we had no reservation I dropped my Italian last name and we were seated very quickly. ��Membership does have its privileges.The array of pizza selections is great. ��We settled on one with spicy pepperoni and pepper flakes. It was so good we ordered another one.Also, though they are not on the menu, you MUST order a bowl of the green olives. ��They are to for.I guess the only downside is that you really can't create your own pie, which is sort of a bummer, but overall a great dining experience."
This place was amazing!The food was to perfection and the service was impeccable...I highly recommend this place :)
I went there to celebrate my bday and I had an amazing time. The place is beautiful and the food was filling and delicious!!
i freakin' love this place
i love geja!!!
"i have ordered two cakes from alliance - one for a wedding shower (almond cake with vanilla buttercream frosting...amazing!) and the other for my son's first birthday (chocolate with a hazelnut/praline mousse). both were outstanding - moist, delicious, reasonably priced, and beautifully decorated. the decoration on my son's birthday cake was fantastic (they replicated his invitation motif perfectly!) - we (and our guests) were incredibly impressed.honorary mention to their stock Niagara Falls cake, which is also a favorite in our house!thanks again, alliance!"
"I've been to Piece three times. The one time in the mid afternoon was best. But the other two visits were marred rather drastically. The pizza is good, but not amazing. The beer is good. And I like to support local. But with all of the amazing craft beer available it's not worth going out of your way to get. But the real killer is the noise. And especially the music. We asked 3 staff at different points to turn it down. And it would come down for 2-3 minutes. Then be cranked back up to ear splitting. It really is pointless to go here with anyone. You have to yell to be heard. My wife was horse by the time we left. My friend said the trumpet was so loud he would rather die than have the audio assault continue. I'm glad for them that they are popular. But the people waiting for a table reall"
"Simply divine and well worth the wait. ��Go, now, and order the short rib soup, oh my!"
"I like this place a lot. It tastes better than most places I tried. However, i do not like the fact that they cook everything in pig fat. You can especially taste this in the beans and other oily items. ��My recommendation to the owners is PLEASE STOP DOING THIS as people like myself who do not eat pork, do not want the fat in my food!"
"Although the sushi is absolutely delicious, the service is horrendous! Now, my friends and I did not have reservations, but I called ahead of time and was told if we showed up by 7:30, we'd be seated in an hour and we could drink while we waited. Our wait turned into 2 hours!! And we couldn't even anesthetize our boredom with alcohol because they ran out of glasses! By the time we sat down, we were tired, hungry, and lost our mojo!! Coast, please work on your waiting area and we might return for your great sushi!"
"My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with this restaurant. The address is a Western address, so we thought we were going to a quick hole in the wall place. When we walked in, this place is huge. We didn't realize there was an entrance on Lincoln and cute windows/doors that are open if weather pemits! The food was good, the queso fundido w/ chorizo was amazing!!! ��The skirt steak fajitas weren't the best steak fajitas I've ever had, but they were good."
"I love their pizza. I was worried when it was on Check Please that people would start going there and it would be too crowded. So far that hasn't happened.http://www.wttw.com/main.taf?erube_fh=cp&�_cp.submit.restaurantDetail=1&cp.id=349I always plan on trying something else, but the pizza is so wonderful I can't help but order it."
"We were in Chicago at the end of August, visiting from Ann Arbor, where Rick Bayless is considered a local celebrity being a U of M alumn. ?We had visitors from France (my sister and my brother in law) and we wanted to take them to a truly special restaurant for dinner. ?Many people that I asked here at U of M where I work highly recommended Frontera Grill. ?Given the expectation, our disappointment was much bigger than it would have been had we never heard of this restaurant. ?First, we called and asked to reserve the table and were told that they do not take reservations, but that if we come we would have to wait for an hour for a table for 4 (on a Wednesday night). ?We decided that we would sit at the bar while waiting and order some drinks and appetizers. ?Waiters were rude and pushy. "
"The little shack is the best! ��You won't be needing any ambiance. Just order a burrito or some tacos and eat in the car . Not out back mind you. You don't want to mess with the people trying to find parking to get in there. ��I live in Cali now and miss this place so damn much. Imagine my surprise when ��I ordered a steak burrito over here and it was filled with rice. ��I was like, what?! ��It's not like I never ate at another good taco place in Chicago. It's just that every time I did, I said to myself, this is good but not as good as La Pasaditas."
Not really worth it if you're not 21...
"I thought this place was great. ��Huge menu, fast service, and very tasty food. ��I went for lunch today with 2 friends, and every dish was great. ��Cheap too!"
"VERY crowded on Sundays around brunch/lunch time, but I can't stop thinking about the delicious eggs I had here. So good. Go here."
"Atmosphere is stuffy. ��Music is lame and too loud. ��The service is pretentious and sloppy. ��The food was so so so so so SALTY. GEEZ put that salt down chefs...I want to actually taste my food!The prices would be right if the food was phenomenal but sadly, its not."
Loved the selection of breakfast food and the spaciousness. Service was OK but it was opening weekend. Have gone back several times and am glad the food has been consistent.
"Fusion aspect is unique. ��Food is yummy. Ambience is beautiful. ��Lychee martinis rock! Was there with a group of 8. ��Sharing appetizers is a wonderful way to try many dishes. ��Vegetable rolls, shrimp with sugarcane,... all good. Macaroon, chocolate mousse are great. ��Will definitely go again."
I could live off egg and cheese pie's. but someone needs to convince them to start putting bacon in them. ive had everything on the menu and its all really really good and those vegan cookies ROCK!
"Nice atmosphere-I would have liked to eat outside but it was too hot. ��I like the casual attire of the wait staff, as it gives a home feel to the place. ��The polenta with meatballs was obscenely good! ��The only letdown for me was the risotto-a little mushy and minimal taste. ��Otherwise a nice meal and I would definitely come back."
"Huge selection of beer, wine, and cocktails. ��Small but decent menu with slightly higher than normal pub prices. ��Service was great compared to your typical pub."
"Great place actually. ��Beer is fantastic and the food is very good and unique. ��I have to say the management seems lacking so far however. ��and I got some attitude from the hipster bartender last night. ��Even so, it's great to have in the area."
"Best persian food I have had in the city.It's like being at home...(if you happen to be persian)IT's not pretentious....the service is good, and the food is fantastic as well as reasonably priced.I suggest Kabob, Gormeh Sabzi, and Ghameh Bademjan ...for the main dishes. ��So good."
This is the Best deep dish pizza in town. so good
"I give them one star that they were open and acknowledged our presence .The service is terrible. We were rushed through the whole thing. Our dinner took maybe 20 minutes since the waiter kept on coming up, interrrupting our conversation and asking if we need anything else. Yes, I might have needed a WARM dinner. I'm vegan/vegetarian and food tasted nasty. The waiter had no idea what was going on in the restaurant and was unfamiliar with their new menu. Mac/Cheese and veggie gyro arrived cold and tasteful. My friends nachos were cold as well and covered in strange cheese mixture ( not fake cheese, realy cheese but strange tasting). ��Place was dirty, way overcrowded for the quality of food, bathrooms in bad condition as well. I would have overlooked all of the above if my food was good and w"
"This is my absolute favorite Italian restaurant in the city! The food is amazing, the atmosphere is fun, and they are always accommodating. ��I can truly not say enough great things about this restaurant. ��If you haven't already been there, you are doing yourself a huge disservice."
"If you wanna take a girl to a sweet romantic restaurant and not worry what she orders, take her to Calos. ��The food is good... the pastas rock... even the steaks... but the atmosphere looks like.... well... they designed it to look like it's an intimate five-star place. ��So the food is good, the ambiance is great, and you're going to get in and out and still have cash in your wallet."
"Loved the food again, will keep coming. Loved the ambience and the waitress was great. I've read the reviews and didn't realize that they had live music and hope to come when they do. This is my 4th time there and won't be my last, but am slightly disappointed that the past two times I was there the very cordial owner wasn't there nor was his very pretty girlfriend. It was nice to see them enjoying the restaurant and schmoozing the customers. ��Oh well, I'll keep coming whether they are there or not."
"First went there in 1995 and have loved it ever since. The bread is always hot and the food perfectly prepared at a great price. Many of the staff have been there forever. Be sure to ask for Lemon Drop shots with a side of a thinly sliced lemon circle, covered with sugar and espresso grinds."
"Great Pizza!!! This place has the best selection of slices at all times!!! Every single time that I have ever been there they had 12 choices of hot fresh slices ready for you to enjoy. ��Usually it consist of 4 Thin Crust, 4 Stuffed (Chicago Style), and 4 Pan. ��Not many places can you go and always count on hot fresh slices of any style combination and ingredient that you'd want. ��I usually go with one thin and one stuffed. ��Their pan style, ��still tasty, is my third option. ��I find it to have way too much bread and not enough sauce. ��Good thing the guys at Art of Pizza keep the big selection hot and fresh at all times!! I subtracted one star because the place is always seems dirty, when you walk into the restaurant you typically see garbage on the tables that looks like it has been there f"
"Okay, so I probably came here over 20 times. ��IT IS SO EFFING GOOD IT WILL BE A MISTAKE TO NOT GO. That is all."
"This place has the best pizza if you're in the mood for stuffed crust pizza. Oh baby, this stuff is good. Especially good on a cold night when you don't want to cook. I think that they take maybe an our to make the pizza but it's awesome. The food is good even if you're not eating the pizza. My thoughts are that the food is good if you get it delivered, but you should really go eat there."
"Had lunch with my family today to celebrate mothers day. I was expecting much with the restaurant since recommended by a friend. The loompya (egg roll) was not so good, the nasi goreng (fried rice with salmon) is not so exceptional but I love the salad crispy salmon, it's yummy. Ebi (sushi) is okay, while spicy ""tail of two tunas"" is good. No fruit juice for kids. When we got our check, 4 items totalling $60+ was added to our bill. Although the waitress apologized, they could have done better. Check what you ordered. ��The servers and attendants were exceptionally fiendly and fast service.The food are expensive. You'll enjoy more if you eat in Joy Yee's.I will definitely not recommend this to friends."
"I love this place. The atmosphere here is nice and the food is fantastic. I love the lamb shank here. I also have tried their kababs (lamb, beef, chicken), and loved them. Atmosphere: Nice atmosphere. nice decorations on the wall. Food: Love the food. Lamb shank was really soft and the sauce that was with it was great. Also gives an abundance of rice and a grilled tomato. Price: Sort pricey but well worth it. I'd say the dishes are probably around the $15 dollar mark. Service: Service was great. I never really had to wait that long for a table, even when it was busy. waitresses were nice and attentive. Overall: I would probably say that this is one of the places in Chicago I can keep going to and not get sick and tired of going to. The food and service are great and it has a nice feel to i"
Love Vietnamese and this is a good place to get some nice and hot Pho.. Fresh ingredients and sometimes there is a bit of a line (which to me points to good food)..
"I was in town visiting my sister and she wanted to take me to this new 'hot spot' which had just opened. ��I lived in Chicago until a few years ago so I am always interested in checking out and keeping up with the newest bars and restaurants. ��Fifty/50 was great, it had a new, fun vibe to it. ��As an upscale sports bar I think it's in the perfect location. ��The people of Chicago like to be chill but they also like to look good! ��I'm a seafood fan but I'm picky so when I ordered the calamari and salmon for my meal I was impressed by the quality. ��They were delicious! I highly recommend it and hope to go back on one of my many annual trips home to Chicago.The management and service was very accomodating and I didn't feel any attitude which I read mentioned in an earlier review. ��I think they w"
Delicious and slurpee.
"Incredible pizza and beer, but the wait can be extreme (90 minutes plus on the weekends). Can be very loud too, but hey it's wicker park and everybody knows how great it is."
"This place is decent. ��It looks beautiful, but the staff has more attitude than the food. ��The food was greasy and it doesn't compare to the incredible, authentic asian restaurants that pepper this great town!"
"Found this Bistro on groupon. Wonderful atmosphere, friendly host, the Salmon was fantastic and my girlfriend loved the vege goulash. The owner, Bronco, even gave us a complimentary ride to the Brown line station in the Limo after our meal! What a guy! Try it out!"
only thing i can say an unbelivable experience everyone should go at least once 5 star all the way
"Feels like amtypical old school establishment, the ambiance is great.The menu is very varied and, on the advice of the waitress, we settled on crab. It was ok but not particularly special. ��At $150 for two with only one course and glass of wine i dont think the price reflected the quality. Another restaurant living off it's reputation but not delivering against it"
"Texas de Brazil looks great when you walk in the door. The waiters are completely helpful, especially if you don't know how a churrascaria works. The salad bar itself could be an entire meal with the delicious shrimp salad and outstanding lobster bisque soup, s in addition to the wide array of cheeses. When the meat starts coming around, it is overwhelming. There were so many choices, I didn't know where to start. My favorite was the picanha, a traditional Brazilian meat. I also loved the filet wrapped in bacon. The service was outstanding. As soon as I flipped my card to green, more food started coming. I also had a beautiful view of the wine artists which were a pleasure to watch. I would recommend Texas de Brazil to anyone and will be returning in the future."
"I've already been back here a few times and I love it! ��I've had a burger, the fish and chips, the cornflake fried chicken, and all are great. ��I've also shared the nachos nirvana and guacamole&salsa&chips, and they are amazing as well. ��The people I've been with have gotten the pulled pork sandwich, portobello mushroom sandwich, grilled cheese deluxe, and various burgers. ��All have been great!! ��The deserts are DELICIOUS... I love their oreo shake, and their brownie in a bowl and it is so chocolaty and warm, yum! ��And if you have to wait for a table, the bar service is also great!! ��Maybe next time I will be healthier and visit the soup&salad bar - it also looks amazing :-)"
"I want to like this place. There are times the food is absolutely mind blowing (the vegan mac and cheese and the vegan nachos have never failed me!) and there are times where the food makes my tongue numb from the salt (reuben! I'm calling you out!)The atmosphere is wonderful and the music is a win for the most part, but man - avoid that reuben at all costs unless you just enjoy licking salt shakers..."
"Easily the most romantic and special date I've been on. This is someplace you go for a special occasion in my opinion, probably not your average going out night. A very helpful staff and the absolute best cccktails I've ever had!"
"I have been here 2 times now. I was blown away the first time and had a great meal the second time. We did the 4 course menu both times and it is a BYOB restaurant, Yay!!. Everyone at the table must do the same amount of courses. If you are lucky enough to experience the scallops as one of your courses, clap your hands and jump for joy because they are absolutely amazing. We only had one disappointing course in our two visits, but I forgive them, as they graciously gave us another course. The lamb chop was under par in the opinion of our entire table. It was just a bad cut, very fatty and extremely difficult to cut. They gave us some yellowfin sashimi afterward and it was very good. This time around, dessert was a delicious, warm molten lava spice cake with a pear galette and vanilla ice c"
So this review is long over due but this place was the worst!!!!! ?the perverted owner practicaly molested my gf....very touchy feelly kinda old euro guy....the place was empty as always when i drive by and we had wanted to check it out for some time....the food was nothing speical i felt like my meal was under cooked and most of all like i mentioned the owner was over the top bad....after he offered my gf & me a shot in some clear white tube and while she was drinking it he kepted saying..suck it yeah ...suck it..ha i was like man should i punch this guy in the face......anyway we wanted to try something new in the area and we were very much dissapointed... i say NO to little bucharest bistro...also they could use some extra lght blubs in that place i felt like i was in dracula's lair....
"Basic point: ��cheap, fast, and good quality. ��While the people taking orders behind the counter sometimes look like they are ready to beat you over the head with a stick if you do not know exactly what you want to order when it is your turn, it probably makes sense for them to have adopted this attitude given that the lines are often all the way out the door at lunch and dinner."
Delicious.
"My favorite place for live jazz in the city. The martinis are perfect and the crowd is suave and delightful. Not the average person goes here. you know I here there is a secret backdoor upstage the Capone used regularlly to escape from the po po! Yes I said it! the PO PO's lol.Anyway, the nice thing about this place is you get there early enough you can great a great seat up front, order a great drink and really enjoy! A must go to legendary place of Chicago!"
"I love this place and i love Italian food. Valet Parking Huge dining room , Portions are beyond generous nice service and a place to go back soonThe owners, the staff, and the bartenders are wonderful people. Highly recommended"
I have to say I really enjoy the food at Le Colonial but I don't appreciate the way the host treats my husband and I. ?We have been coming to the restaurant at least 2 times a month for a couple of years. He still doesn't recognize us. Admittedly our checks are only in the $120-$150 range but come on...he doesn't recognize us? ?Could care less if we got a table or not. We often go in very early (5:00-5:30) and he will tell us he has nothing except the table right in front of the hostess stand and the balance of the restaurant is empty. Then he wants to show us the book as to prove he's not lying to us. Last time he said for us to go upstairs and have dinner on the couch. ?We love the food and long for a night when he is not there. My husband always orders the red snapper and I have tried e
"great vibe.really great cocktails.really, really great staff.really, really, really fun menu!!!"
"I met some co-workers after work on Thursday for a beer and some wings. A friend of mine told me they had great wings. I ordered the spicy wings but was not too impressed with them, they were a bit soggy, the spicy wing sauce was good though. They did not have a huge selection of drafts and the place was kind of small. I don't have any major complaints except I was hopping those wings would have been a bit better. The vibe was OK, I would go back!!"
"I must say that this pizzeria is far from authentic. ��Living in FL, my girlfriend and I go every Sunday night to a pizza joint to experience the best pizza maker this side of the Atlantic. ��I will not mention that restaurants name nor his name because I want to validate my displeasure with Spacca. ��Both of us have spent time in Italy and know the flavor, taste and experience of an authentic Italian flat pizza. ��We were excited to have Spacca recommended to us from the same chef in FL. ��He assured us that the owner did his apprenticeship and purchased his equipment from Napoli, thus making him a good cook.So, we made the trip from River North on the train. ��Once we got there, the owner of the restaurant was running himself tired. ��We knew right away that if he was the owner, he couldn't be "
"I was extremely happy when I first heard about Longman and Eagle. A place that would be serving delicious foods til 1am that's only 3 blocks from my house and specializing in whiskey? Have a door connecting to G-Mart comics and I would never leave. But unfortunately, I've been soured.The food is great. GREAT. I've had the rabbit pate, burger, sweetbreads, and marrow bones and I've never left disappointed with the food. I literally savor every bite. My hats off to the chefs. HOWEVER, all my experiences there have been ruined by the bar staff. I have sat at the bar every time I've gone and every time, I've had awful experiences at the bar. Granted I know its a busy place and pretty new, but when I enter an order for a drink, it should get there before my food. When I'm spending my money on f"
"OMG, Welcome to my new weakness. ��The burgers here are amazing! ��I got the Ponzi Scheme with apples, fried prosciutto and Swiss cheese and I added a fried egg (don't forget the pretzel bun!). ��I don't know what kind of meat is in these burgers, but I have not had a burger this good since I was in Miami at LaTub. ��The beer list is extensive which I really like because I like to try out new imports. ��I think my favorite thing yet though was the Mac and Cheese!!! It has cheese imported from Ireland and it has a little kick to it. ��I wanted to take an order home. ��The music here seems to get heavier at the night goes on, and I think the food is offered until close. ��I will be tipping a few back here and can't wait to try other items on the menu. Highly recommended! :)"
"I am a bar snob, hands down. ?I want good drinks, great atmosphere, but honestly, when my ?husband and I go out- we just want to have a fantastic time. ?And here, we always leave super happy, and super tipsy. ?(thankfully we live down the street) ?So what if our wallet is a tad lighter. ?Thats why you go out, duh!! ?And at the violet hour, I feel pampered. ?We always sit at the bar, its like witnessing magic the way they make the drinks- especially when they have to crack an egg. ?oh so fabo!!Last time we were there, I think Troy was our bartender and he braved through all of the questions that my hubby was throwing his way. ?Whats that? where's that whiskey from? How many Pisco's do you have? ?etc. ?Kinda embarrassing normally, but Troy was happy to educate my liquored up lover even when "
Loved this place everything was just amazing. ��This is a great BYOB a gem of Chicago!
"I went here on a first date. We have been together for almost a year and a half now and whenever we want to celebrate something special, we go back to where it all began. The fried pickles are so yummy. you really cannot pick a bad item from the menu. Try the blood orange Mojito you will be amazed at how tasty it is! The service can be here nor there on a busy night but overall, this place is one of my favorites. I have never been able to try dessert but I vow to try it and give you a review!"
Always like this place. Love it for classic breakfast
Great Pizza.
"I was one step from giving Sultan's 5 stars! The only thing holding me back is that I know what it was like before they opened thier second store! The falafel sandwich is still the tastiest in the city but before the franchise it felt like the employees making the sandwiches took much more care in listening to your order and gently making the sandwiches.I never had a falafel sandwich burst open or fall apart until that change over when some of the folks from the Wicker Park location were moved to Lincoln park. ��Customer service is down two points but, the tasty factor is still there!Also, new smoothies not so good! Stick with getting the Naked juices!BUT OH BABY THE LENTIL SOUP! That's off the hook! ��So really...Sultan's still comes out as a winner in my book. I just wish they'd take care "
"I took a good friend :) of mine here last night and really enjoyed the food! we sat down at our table and it was nicely laid out the room was really cozy very family like. I had the gnocchi with bolognese sauce which was divine :) it's a BYOB place and without a corking fee made everything really affordable. A really great place good food, home like atmosphere and great prices."
"Meat lovers, rejoice! This place is definitely not good for your budget, or your waistline; but I suppose, that's what makes it so good! If you can splurge, do it here. Their meats, and there are so very many, are all cooked to perfection and seasoned just right! The salad bar should be renamed in order to include what's available here at Brazzaz. Breads, cheeses, sushi, pasta, vegetables, salads; whatever, it's there. There wine list is as wonderful as their staff. When I visited Brazzaz, it was 9:30 on a Thursday, and they still let us eat. Not only were they accommodating enough to even serve us, they were still sure to ask if we had any requests from the grill. Whether it be beef, pork, chicken or lamb that you crave, don't choose just one, Brazzaz has got your back in all categories!!"
"Don't waste your time or money. After leaving messages for a reservation for 3 weeks without getting a return call, they called and said they had a spot that evening. We went but couldn't stand the hip hop music that was blasting so loudly that the entire dining room vibrated. Who wants to spend $110 on dinner and not be able to hear each other talk? When we asked if they could turn it down, we were told, This is the music we play here and it will be on all night. If a restaurant doesn't care about giving the diner a great experience all the way around, why go there????? There's much better dining experiences in Chicago."
The Korean BBQ cooking system is good and the taste is great.But service should be more improved and changed the dishes and so on...
"Tried to give it 4.5 stars. We never do 5, so this means awesome to us.This review is kind of a 4fer. Each of our 4 diners contributed to this review.Experience was awesome, like nothing any of us has experienced. All of us foodies, and actually one is a national, award winning hospitality consultant.This is not for the weak pocket book. Get over this concept before you arrive and you will have an exceptional dining experience.Initially we weren't too excited that the whole table had to subscribe to the same general order ( for instance, all must do one of the tasting courses or order ala carte. And if you order the tasting course, they all must be the same number ) The table had the attitude to go big or go home, ergo the 15 course tasting menu it was. Right choice......no question......f"
"First of all, can I just say one thing? This place is so SMALL. What a tiny bar! I was surprised. Their second level is about the size of a closet with only 3 tables. Luckily though, my friends and I snagged one of those tables on a crowded Saturday night (woo-hoo!)One of the waitress/servers was an absolute sweetheart! I didn't catch her name, but she had short dark hair and was always smiling (which is refreshing for a change! Most waitress' glare at you the second they walk up to your ��table as if trying to convey the ""tough bar bitch"" look). She was super-friendly! My girl friends & I weren't sure what to order since it was our first time there (the place just opened up that week too) so we asked her for suggestions and she was extremely helpful! I absolutely ADORE the fact that they p"
"They have perfected the art of cheap delicious deep dish pizza. The thin crust pizza is not as impressive, but they have the deep dish and stuffed pizzas down pat. Even better than the fancy expensive places downtown!"
Very slow service here with a group of 10 and it has been 2 hours and still no dinner. Drinks are pure alcohol
I've only been here once but it was some of the best damn Chicago deep dish i have ever had.
Stopped in for a snack and this was just what the doctor ordered. I had the lengua and my wife got the salami plate. There were tons of excellent wines to choose from and a wide-ranging charcuterie menu from the sopressata to the lengua. ��We'll definitely be going back for more.
"I actually liked this restaurant particularly because its open till 5am however i've went there recently and found a BUG in my soup... i didn't want to make a big deal so i called the waitress and confirmed her that there was a bug in my soup however instead of the waitress and the owner apologizing they said it was not a bug and it was an ingridient in the soup that looks like a bug and they tried to squish it to hide the evidence so i took the picture of the bug and asked the other customers if it was a bug or not... ofcourse they all agreed with me it was a bug. ��There food might be decent however there customer service and the ""INGREDIENTS"" is not so appealing. ��The owner finally agreed it was a bug but it was not there fault she said it was a bug with wings so it fell into the soup. ��"
"The food was unbelievable! ��The guacamole was absolutely delicious, fresh and authentic! ��The salsa was fantastic and laced with fresh cilantro - I suppose some people might find it a little hot but it was perfect for me. �� My brother ordered the enchiladas. ��He thought it had a nice sauce and lots of flavor (and he normally doesn't order enchiladas - so he was a bit nervous). ��We raved to our waiter Alejandro. ��He was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about our choices. ��In fact, everyone there was extremely enthusiastic. ��And for anyone that is a vegetarian: the chips are deep fried in vegetable oil!"
"When our neighborhood restaurant closed, we were looking for a new place to enjoy some good Italian food. ��Our friend, Chris, became a waiter at LaVilla and suggested we try out the place. ��We have now become Thursday night regulars and besides always enjoying great food, we have gotten to know their staff. ��From their hostess, Gwen, to our favorite waiter, Chris, to the busboy, Roberto, and to the bartender, Jose, we are always greeted warmly and assured of great cocktails, wonderful pastas, pizza, steaks and chicken dinners. ��It's the next best place to having dinner at home!"
"First you guys need more staff , seriously two bartenders? We waited 30minutes at the bar before figuring out were not getting served."
This is my favorite for vegan/vegetarian. ��Great menu. ��Love the reuben and sweet potato fries. ��I ordered the sangria which I was told was not vegan. ��This is where I learned that not all wine is vegan. ��Who knew. ��Tried a little of my date's gyros and it was pretty darn good too. ��Maybe next time. �� �� Never had dessert there since I couldn't even finish all my dinner but it looked pretty good. ��Next time I'll save some room.
"I have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant since I never really developed an appreciation for Chinese cuisine in general. Sadly, this restaurant didn't help. They were out of the pea shoot dish, so we ordered the Chinese broccoli and it was tasty. We also order chicken sizzling rice soup, which turned out to be inedible goop akin to pork and beans. Yes, we ordered soup and, instead of broth, a bowl of liquid with the consistency of pork and beans arrived at our table. GROSS. We also got the fried chicken that comes with szechuan peppers. I didn't really care for the dish as it wasn't discernibly spicy, the chicken meat was almost non-existent, and it was oilier than a little ceasar's pizza. There seemed to be a language barrier (even though I went with a person who spoke Chinese) an"
"I was excited to visit Big Jones as I had heard great things about the place. ��Upon arrival, I was impressed by the aesthetic and atmosphere. ��We were immediately seated at a table by the kitchen. ��Not a great a table as the staff seems to congregate by the kitchens' window. ��The lighting is horrible. ��We had a spotlight glaring down at our table. ��It was quite distracting. ��Our waiter was less then friendly but not rude. ��My friend inquired about the vegetarian selection and to his dismay, the waiter explained he was vegan and never tried anything on the menu. ��My suggestion to the waiter is to just fake it and make a suggestion based on advice from the kitchen and previous guest. ��My friend ended up eating a dinner salad as his entre. ��We were kind of surprised by the poor selection of v"
Outstanding !! ��Fine dining in a casual setting . My husband and I went to a underground dining night which is by invitation only and we were blown away . The Chef greeted us at the door and we were seated right away . The server was attentive and very knowledgeable about the food and ��the wine we brought in with us . They are BYOB and will kindly pair your wine with your courses as they come out . ��You can find the nights menu online so you can choose your wine accordingly. ��We had a five course meal that was truly spectacular ��from start to finish . The restaurant is very small but very cozy and relaxing . They do need a credit card to hold your reservation which is understandable since seating is limited . ��Bonsoiree is a wonderful and welcomed addition to the neighborhood. ��We will cer
"This was some of the best chicken I've eaten in a long time! ?I would definitely come here again. ?My friend and I went during Jeopardy and the employees were really cool about playing. ?Mr friend told me about a cool thing they do there. ?Ask if a dude named Alden is working and if he is and you tell him Zach sent you, he'll let you put the TV on whatever channel you want!"
"I normally do not like eating at chain restaurants like Ruths Chris, but it is decent. ��However, their cuts taste more like choice than prime. ��There are better steakhouses in Chicago that you should eat at; you can eat at a Ruths Chris just about anywhere. ��Service was excellent."
"Superdawg is a family favorite. Kids love the car hop service, hot dogs and burgers are great and the grilled cheese is really yummy too. Thick shakes and fantastic onion chips. Love that you can now order a dog, burger, etc without fries for $2.50 less and you can also get drinks for a buck. This is great for our family because the kids never eat all the fries, so we now order at least one meal with no fries and save a little $. Superdawg isn't cheap, but it seems they are trying to provide cost saving options, which I really appreciate."
"We placed a catering order from Simply It for a party of 50. ��I spoke with the owner, Mr. Tuan, several times in the process of placing the order. ��He was wonderful about walking through the menu and making suggestions. ��The food arrived on time and was delicious. ��He threw in a few dishes for free, and we had more than enough food for the group. ��I got more than a dozen compliments on the food - it was a huge hit!"
"I love Lockdown's theme and food! Delicious! My favorite burger to get is the Fat Elivs, it's sweet meet's salty and AMAZING!But, I am mainly doing this review on a particular server. Sigh.I usually come in the evenings but the past few time's I went in the AM when it isn't so busy, figuring I could get in and get out during my lunch hour. Psh. NOT the case. Each time I have gone in the AM it was the same server, I don't even know her name as she barely talked to me. It wasn't busy so I sat myself at a table and waited (the busboy came over immediately and game me a menu, water and silverware, he was truly awesome). Each time I knew what I wanted so I just sat and waited, and waited and waited some more. The server (they only have had one when I have came in she bartends and serves) was pl"
"They don't have mustard, mayo, cornichons... heh. I wonder if the waitress even new what pickles were. Before I could let her finish her uneducated excuse that the chefs were really particular.... I gave up. If I were her I would have given up 5 weeks ago when they first opened. Mario Batali's protege- you should be ashamed- no mustard? f... man."
"My husband and I was looking for a good brunch spot and saw the awesome reviews on this local spot. It did not disappoint. I got the french toast special with vanilla bean sauce and topped with strawberries and chocolate crumbles. Omg, it was soooo good! The house potatoes were awesome too! There was an hour wait but it was totally worth it. Definitely recommend this place!"
unlike others I did not have to wait long for dinner! plus for me! and Dinner was really good.
"Went to Lao Sze Chuan on 12/27/2011 with the family. ��As one of the other reviewers wrote - CONSISTENCY IS KING! ��We've eaten here many times and loved the food, but this time we were seated upstairs. ��My family (with two young daughters under 5 years old) were seated at a large table by the staff when the Host started yelling! ��Everyone stopped talking, looked at us and wondered what was happening. ��The Host told us the table was for a large group AND KICKED US OUT - very, very rude! ��I told him we were seated by the staff upstairs and he yelled at them. ��I have NEVER been treated so badly at a restaurant and so embarassed.The food is great here, but service has killed my appetite for this restaurant. ��Do not recommend."
"You can't find a better place for seafood in Chicago. Great oysters, crab, lobster, etc. The sushi is very good as well. The lounge is a great place for a casual dinner and they also have music a few nights. Not cheap but worth the money for fresh seafood."
This place is the same as it was 20 years ago!The hotdogs were still steaming hot for the 30 minuteride home (February) and delicious!Love this place. ?LA has Pinks but we have Super Dawg.!
The only better restaurant I could think of could possibly be... El Bulli's. Possibly.
"In a nutshell, it is a sophisticated place with good food. The only thing I dislike about Alinea Restaurant is you need to book room months before actually visiting the place. I guess, this comes naturally with being one of the world's top restaurant. Coming to the food, I was pretty much impressed with the way it was presented. Forget about the actual taste, but only the presentation manages to convince you psychologically that the food is awesome. Having said that, I would also like to advice Alinea Restaurant to work on its service. The service you get here is definitely not anyone would expect from a high-end restaurant. This is the only disappointing factor I came across."
"Let me just say that join to The Bongo Room is an experience that I will never forget. My friend and I make join for pancakes an event, a girls night out. Honestly I may never be able to go to iHop again.  �� �� Anyway we got to The Bongo Room in Wicker Park around 10 and had to wait about ten minutes. By the time we left, the line was out the door. Word to the wise, get there early. One look at the menu and you know The Bongo Room is far from normal. We ended up ordering bacon and banana pancakes & pumpkin and chocolate cheesecake pancakes. They were both delicious. strange, but delicious. Also the coffee and service were excellent.Why only 4 stars?? because I am a college student and one breakfast of only pancakes (albeit large orders of pancakes) and coffee was close to 30 dollars. This p"
"Well I have been going to the Greek Islands since 1972 or so and have never had a bad meal there-- but last night was the best-- Perfect broiled octopus appetizer,perfect lamb dishes, perfect desserts (baklava of course and galaktoboureko-- smooth as I have every had)...mousaka-- salads-- perfect--- and the great service where food comes quickly but you are not rushed to leave...And the salt is way down from it used to be-- I think that is a great improvement-- I amnot thirsty for the entire night. Oh-- bread terrific as always."
Pretty good hot dogs. Enjoy the drive up experience and getting the food in a box.
"I would give this place zero stars.My husband and i heard the Mac n cheese was really good so we decided to try it.We never found out because of the rude ""hostess"".We came in at 9:15pm and it was not too busy and there were plenty of available tables. As soon as we walked in the hostess looked us up and down and barked that MAYBE if a reservation cancelled, we could have a table. We should wait at the bar.There were at least 15 tables open and we did not want to wait at the bar. We walked out immediately and they just looked at us confused.I am disgusted by their rude and unfriendly behavior.Life is too short to waste money in establishments that do not appreciate and value the customer.TERRIBLE SERVICE"
"I decided to check this place out when Groupon offered a deal and I'm glad that I did. My BF and I went for brunch and were pleasantly surprised by the live guitarist they had. The food was very good...I had the Cuban steak sandwich which have very nice flavors and my BF had the honey jalapeno pork chops which he loved! I also tried their pomegranate mojito which was yummy and a nice size. Prices were not bad either...our Groupon was for $40.00 and we had to order a couple of extra things to make sure we made the amount! The only small complaint that I have is that the service wasn't the best. They weren't bad, but they weren't as on top of things as they should have been. However everyone was very friendly so that helped to not make it that big of an issue. We're planning to go again and "
Tank noodles was really fun. The bubble tea was super yummy and creamy. The spring rolls had nice and crunchy bean sprouts =).Serice was ok and it was real real busy. The Pho was yummy and warm also.
The restauraunt is small but the food make up for the lack of space and the wait! The waitress got our order wrong but we ate it wanyway because everything on the menu is delicious!
"Went here once a few years ago after a day shopping on the Mag Mile. ��Remember having a really nice meal. ��Can't recall exactly what I had, but it was good. It had an elegant atmosphere, but was not too pretentious. ��I didn't feel uncomfortable in jeans there, but felt thoroughly sophistocated in this beautiful restaurant. ��It is pretty convenient to everything downtown too. ��Overall, a great experience."
Always great service. Food is really good. I love vegan comfort food and this is the place to get it in Chicago!
I love this place! Not only is the food awesome but the staff does a great job! We hosted a rehearsal dinner party in July for our son and fianc��e and the staff did a fantastic job. The Wine room worked beautifully for the party and we had access to the whole upper floor. Mary Catherine and Stephanie handled all our arrangements exactly as I asked including a wonderful custom menu card with the couples names and picture. The whole event was wonderful! Thank you!!!!
"Shaw's offers great fresh seafood, with 2 choices of atmosphere. ��Feeling a little casual? ��No problem, they offer the full menu in the bar. ��And if you're looking for something fancier, make reservations in the dining room. ��The dining room's ambiance is nice, it makes a great romantic location. ��I thought the service was good, but the food was great. ��Not a bad place to surf n turf, the steak was very good also. ��If you are looking for strictly seafood, you will be hard pressed to find something that tops Shaws."
"5 stars for lunch....We go here mostly during lunch and it is always wonderful, but I went there last night for dinner and wow, what a disappointment. ��When we arrived, the place was packed and it took a few minutes to get anyone to greet us. When the hostess did see us, she was very cold, hard to understand and barely looked at us. ��I didn't think much of it, for they were really busy. ��There wasn't any room at the bar, so we just stood there. ��It would have been nice if someone would have offered to get us a drink while we waited. Waiting that long without a drink was a bummer. I asked if they could hang our coats up and was told no. ��We stood in the front and watched the male manager greet and take care of regular customers, yet he never said anything to us. ��Calo obviously has a lot of"
"In Chicago on business and gave this a try. Went for dinner and a weeknight when it was about 1/3 full.The positives: Nice atmosphere, great service, vast menu, and large portions of quality food. I liked the complimentary naan and marsala dip. Naan was very good; buttery crispy yet soft in the middle with flakes of cilantro. Getting a hot towel at the end of the meal was nice too. The not so positives: ��While the food quality was very good and the portions were large, I felt the actual taste/flavor of the masala curry was lacking. I ordered my favorite chicken tikka masala. I wanted lamb but they wouldn't do it. Which is strange since they have tikka masala for other meats (even shrimp) but not lamb? They can make a lamb chili masala but not tikka?? Seriously, over like 100 menu items and"
"Great service, just ask for Dino (aka Dan), and awesome food! Highly recommended."
"We had the 8 courses menu.very disappointing experience.The baked potato was very average - the cheese and cracker was simply bad and we couldn't finish it... definitely a lack of flavor in most of the ingredients. The trout was just ok, probably a bit too cooked.Some of the chocolates were just awful - the white one was tasting like a piece of butter.A third of the restaurant was empty - weird when you think how difficult it is to get a reservation.deconstructive cuisine requires a real talent... otherwise it looks like very very pretentious.Service was very average as well ?(keep your bottle on the table or you'll have to ask more than once to be served).The only thing we finally enjoyed is our wine - yes, it's great, it's a BYOB.For a much better experience, go to North Pond!!!"
"l must say, l wasn't as impressed with this place as most people seem to be. ��Don't get me wrong, the food was good. ��lt just didn't send me into any fit of delight. ��The saganaki was ok... and my meal, l had a gyro platter, tasted like any other l have had before. ��The salad was good, the gyro good, l cannot complain about it, it just didn't have that YEESSSS factor. ��THe service was good, we went at non peak hours so l can't say if it is any different under stress.l am going to have to try it again to see if l didn't miss something. ��l hope so since l do love a good Greek place!"
"I was finally able to try this place after hearing excellent things about it from my other friends; let's just say I didn't know what I was missing out on!I recently moved into the area and was looking for some good Vietnamese food to satiate my craving. I previously ventured around the Argyle area, but once I tried Simply It's food, the restaurants in Argyle became very mediocre in comparison!The service here is great--attentive and friendly (especially the owner!). Upon entering, the owner jumped out of his seat to greet and seat us. My water glass was never too empty and empty plates were never on the table for too long. The atmosphere was cozy and warm, which definitely helped me get over the Chicago chill.The food itself was delicious. I split a bowl of the beef noodle soup (pho bo?) "
Carnival Restuarant....1/16/2010 If you are planning to go to this restaurant with your friends....DON'T If you are planning to celebrate a birthday with your friends and want to go here....DON'T If you are looking for a good plate of Hispanic cuisine and go here thinking you will get it......then you will be WRONG!!! If you think Carnivale served the best Mojitos in town....you will definitely be.....Wrong!!! If you order coffee here and ask the server what kind of coffee they served...be carefull cause you will get a smart ass reply of we don't grow coffee in America The food here sucks and is overpriced!!

"Holy crap this place is uh-mazing! I had some of the porkbelly soup and was blown away by flavors. The pork belly was crispy yet tender, and the broth was just so tasty. It had plenty of avocados, and my mexican friend tells me this is how it should be. ��I also had the the churro with chocolate, and I could not get enough of it. I don't even like churro (at least the ones I've eaten from Sams club - LOL)! I docked a point off since parking sucks in this area and the seating is lame."
"Try their delicious vietnamese sandwiches (aka banh)! Tender, juicy, marinated roast beef or duck, topped with pickled radish, carrots, cilantro, peppers and mayo. Perfect for a quick and inexpensive lunch!"
"(1) I love the food here -- sooo good, reasonable prices, etc. (2) The staff/owners really appear not to give a #@$ about their restaurant. ?Three times now we have gone and been told that they are either closing in 10 minutes or the kitchen just closed -- Sorry! usually an hour or more before their scheduled closing time. ?This is so NOT how to run a restaurant -- especially given their central location in the middle of Andersonville -- and when their web site says they're open until 10 pm, why are they closing at 9? ?I would understand if it happened once, but three times?!? ?We went to Antica down the street -- had some awesome pizza instead, and while their door advertised a 9:30 closing time, they [gratefully] welcomed people until easily until 10pm (on a Wednesday night)."

First waited in line for 40 minutes, kept reminding them only to hear that they forgot about my party as i stood in front of the host stand with frequent reminders.Chaotic host stand, chaotic service, was told only 3 wait staff for over 200 seats????? Pretty insane, especially if they moved from one location to another, without thought of service needs.i wanted to like this place and help out our restauranteurs in this economy.Service was not to be seen, and when present, they looked under the tables for seating numbers for identification, trying to figure out where to bring food. Chaos.Duck looked good, and am sure was good, however, hard for me to return.Food "

"Great Pasta, Pizza, and more! ��Calo is an excellent place for dining in or grabbing something to go. ��If you like a lot of cheese on your pizza, this is the place to go. ��Chicken is always very nice. ��They give you lots of food, you can definately split dishes or take some to go. ��Make sure to call ahead. ��Parking isn't bad as they have a lot across the street. ��We go on special occasions as it is a little pricey, but worth every penny."
"Good food and nice local. ��I really liked the bartender, she was funny. ��Also, across from Green Mill. ��Dinner can get crowded but that is cool with me."
I was there for dinner this evening. ��Overall I'm pretty happy with the quality of the pizza here. ��I will give them credit for speeding up the ordering process. ��If there is a wait outside they order your pizza right away for you and get it started cooking (the deep dish pizzas take 45 minutes). ��Upon sitting down at your table you might only be there 10 minutes and your hot fresh pizza is delivered to the table. ��Here is the big problem that I have that many might not notice. ��I went there with my girl friend and we ordered a large deep dish pizza. ��Half sausage / half pepperoni then garlic on the entire pizza. ��The big surprise to me was that they actually used CANNED garlic on the pizza. ��By canned garlic I mean it was not a fresh garlic clove that was then chopped up...nooooooooo...th
"I had a wonderful meal here. Very tasty coconut curry shrimp, which was not too spicy and very flavorful. The details weren't as impressive. The service was nothing to shout about and the upstairs closed-in deck area where we ate was very crowded and cramped. Intimate feel, if you want to be intimate with all those surrounding you. While waiting for our table, we sat in the upstairs lounge where the country and alt-rock music didn't fit the quaint atmosphere at all."
"Amazing pizza. ��Only tried the stuffed pizza and the small was twice as much as I could eat. ��Huge crust, loaded with cheese and that real tomato sauce Chicago is famous for."
"One word - disappointed. ��I have Celiac and must eat gluten-free. ��I said that in my reservation and the ""girls"" at the front desk looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language. ��The salad bar looked beautiful but since everything was sitting in a sauce, I couldn't eat much. ��The meat offerings seemed slim. ��Not as much offered as advertised. ��I have eaten at Fogo de Chao where the manager came out and walked me around the salad bar and explained which dishes I could not eat, and that there was one meat I could not eat. ��Brazzaz costs the same at Fogo de Chao so unless you have a buy one/get one coupon (like I did), go spend your money at Fogo!"
"Avoid This Restaurant ��- Enjoy this restaurant if you don't mind eating at an establishment where the owner considers it his choice whether to pay employees. I write this because the daughter of one of my friends hired to work at their Lincoln Park location on weekends was never paid by the owner. She only worked there a few days, but because of her school demands had to take another job with a better schedule. Despite repeated phone calls and letters and promises by the manager that the owner said she would be paid, the owner in reality has ignored all requests to pay this 19-year-old her justly due wages. The owner is dishonest as far as I'm concerned. I"
"DELICIOUS! ��I have lived in the city for about a year and never stepped foot in this little gem of a restaurant. ��The food was outstanding and the atmosphere was wonderful. ��We were able to walk in and be seated, but I think that as the night went on you needed to have reservations. ��5 stars!"
"Walk around Lincoln Park Zoo for about an hour then walk across the street to the birthplace of the salad bar. ��I have seen bigger and better salad bars, but you can't beat the homemade soup. ��Great cozy atmosphere too."
"I like wildfire better, but it is still top notch"
"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and tasty food."
"I really Like Hot Dougs. I think he is an innovator and pioneer in this area. After going there many times, I believe each time is a little less great as the previous time. I guess this is statistically consistent given the standard deviation of your first and ultimate experience; it would be nearly impossible to replicate that feeling every future visit.The only thing that has changed for me as far as Hot Doug's goes is that amount of time I am willing to wait in line.After going over 5 times, I wouldn't wait more than 15-20 minutes to get in, and for those who know, this is almost an impossibility."
"The food was good but I've had better, the service was poor, and the all you can eat wasn't exactly that."
"I went last nite 2/17/11 I sat, I ate, I felt sad. ��Here are my reasons: I have visited in the past and the food was prepared excellent in a very succulent manner w/ in-depth flavor. ��But this time I felt cheated and unfortunately feel the ramifications this morning. ��Our complete meal was discouraging especially when the waitress told us there was no more meat to serve. ��After that stement everything went downhill, our beverages were warm, customer service was lacking and there was no satisfaction in our dinner. ��Needless to say, I wont be returning again especially after being red-faced with my friends since I really spoke highly of this restaurant."
"Two words: FOIE GRAS. On a hot dog. Get the duck fries too, and make sure to get a cup o' cheese for dipping!"
We love Calo. ��We have been eating there for the past 20 years. ��My kids love to go there for birthday dinners. ��We order pizza from them just about every friday. ��The service is great and the prices are right.
Rabbit salad is AMAZING and Billy is always wonderful. ��Great winter hang out! ��Nice scotch list.
Delicious! ��What an incredible menu....absolutely perfect dining experience. ��I can't wait to go back again. ��Perfect place to bring a date.
"Decent pizza, convenient delivery"
"It's pricy but I like their hot chocolate is one of the best. Lobster sandwich is good as well but for 20 bucks? Well.. I'm not sure,,,"
the back bar makes you feel as though you have been transported to China - super cool! ��the best pear martinis in the city!! ��great apps too. ��cash only.
"great food, great prices, delivery is super fast. ��flavors are fresh and bright. ��love this place"
"Came in for the great wings and to watch sports. The wings were great, the sport watching was a little tough as this little spot got very crowded. Great for them - bad for me. That being said, a good spot to meet up with friends during the week to avoid the weekend crowds."
"Go to Schwa if you can. ��It was my 18th birthday dinner, and this meal kicked the ass of my dad's ��60th birthday at L20 a year ago. ��The service was great, the food was amazing, and the entire experience was laid back in a way no other fine dining experience would be. ��We ordered the 9 course meal, but ended up with 12 dishes (possibly thanks to a bottle of wine gifted to the kitchen crew). ��Highlights included a fig and scallop dish, the infamous quail egg ravioli, a smore with campfire smoke, and the perfectly cooked octopus with pineapple. ��As the night ended I made a trip through the kitchen to the bathroom. On my way Chef Carlson asked how the meal was. ��I said it then, i'll say it again, it was amazing. ��Thank you Schwa and Chef Carlson, you deserved at least 2 stars, if not 3."
"I am in love with the Grunt Burger (blue cheese)!! ��Also MUST have the cookie & ice cream dessert, SO good :d ��I've had the fish and chips before too, which I liked a lot. ��Great location, open late, reasonable prices, fun casual atmosphere. ��Can't wait to eat there again!"
I was just curious after reading everyone's wonderful reviews and seeing the challenges of making reservations (which seems well worth it)How far in advance to you start trying to make reservations?
"This would be my first and absolutely not last visit to Wildfire.the restaurant boost a low key atmosphere with very knowledgeable and friendly staff.Now for the food, and being spoiled with succulent juicy shrimp in other parts of the world there shrimp falls bleak in comparison. You'd swear they are serving us up with a bowl of crushed ice and 5 pencil like worms that had the color of shrimp. I did not enjoy these. Sorry guys but I am going to give you an F for trying.My wife has an french onion soup, hmm I am not sure how to describe this one but I believe they wanted to serve us a bowl of brown water and a heap of sugar. I have yet to find out when french onion soup has changed to a sugary very sweet recipe. Yes another F for this dish.Funny all of us went for the sirloin steak I had m"
"This is my favorite Pizza spot in the North side of the City! The pizza is nice and thin with the perfect amount of cheese to sauce ratio. The beer selection is also great. They make their own beers, plus they carry many other brands as well. My wife is a huge fan of the Chicken Cesar Salad, she says they have large pieces that are always very lean. Definitely recommend this place, the atmosphere is also great for just a casual meal or game day."
"Great place, i went by yesterday 03/31 with my friends.We all decided to come back again,everything was great.The food and the personal are the best.They have my vote!"
"Came here for a late lunch, early dinner. ��The service was horrible. ��First, we sat there for over 10 minutes before we were greeted, when finally a waitress came over and tool our drink order. ��As soon as she walked away another waitress came over with the same robot introduction. ��It was mid afternoon, and not busy. ��We received our drinks and ordered appetizers. ��The house made meats were good. ��Cheeses were also very good, and a great assortment. ��Our waitress never came back to take our order for the rest of our food. ��Never in the dining room so I couldn't even get her attension. ��She was chit chatting with the bus boy and the other servers while we were waiting and waiting. We finally ordered the rest of our meal and it was good. ��Not anything amazing or memorable. ��Definatley not w"
"The food is great, however, the prices have recently skyrocketed, its still affordable, but not as good of deal, used to be i could get a flaffel for 3.00 and hummus for 3, and itd be like 6 something total, or whatever they felt like charging me, i was there a few days ago, and the same thing cost me 10.00.... again, not out rageous, but a big price hike in just a few months span"
fantastic food. awesome service. great place to bring someone that is visiting or new to the city. has a cool wow factor and you leave stuffed!
"I was so excited to go here all summer. Me and my girlfriend got sat right away which was nice. We ordered drinks and the cargo shrimp appetizer which was delicous but it stopped there. First i had to request a new app. plate TWICE because they were both dirty. I ordered the mahi mahi the sesame sauce had NO FLAVOR , and my fish was extremly over cooked , not to mention the 2 pieces of asparagus were so hard i could have cracked a tooth. I asked my girlfriend how her artic char was and she say BLAH! I was extremly disapointed especially cuz everyone i know has liked it."
I always have a pleasant experience at Chicago Diner. The staff is super friendly and almost everything I have tried is tasty. My newest favorite is the firehouse chipotle chicken wrap or something to that effect. The reuben is excellent as well! I also love the buffalo seitan appetizer. It seems to have improved recently. It was always good but it was extra crispy the last time I had it. The vegan desserts here are also outstanding. I recommend the cheesecake and the tiramisu cupcake! Can't wait to return!
"i went to Mayan Palace for dinner last Saturday with a group of 10. ��We didn't have reservations but were seated in 5 minutes. ��The staff was super accomodating. ��The margaritas were just ok but the food was delicious. ��The mole sauce for the enchiladas tasted like actual mole sauce instead of ketchup, salsa and bbq sauce mixed together like most places i've tried. ��they also have a back room so don't worry if it looks crowded. ��i would def go here again!"
Have been coming to Wishbone for brunch since I moved to the neighborhood a few years ago. Great food and quick service. Definitely recommend their southern specialties like the jambalaya omelet paired with ��home fries and the warm corn muffins. We almost always take our out of town guests here and they love it...my sister and brother in-law insisted that we go two days straight after their first visit. Family friendly with lots of strollers in the early morning (before 10).
I would eat a homeless man before I would eat their duck fries again. ��THey smell like ass and you people seem to like that.
"Having eaten here over 100 times, I can write you an honest review from many angles. 1. The Pizza - some of the best I have had in Chicago, despite being from New Haven, CT. ��It is thin crust, and the flavors are a mouth massage. ��Usually I get their traditional red sauce pizza, but sometimes I get crazy and have the white pizza with sausage and banana peppers. ��That is one of the best pizzas I have EVER had. ��Often I get extra cheese, because they don't slop a ton on there and well I like mine cheesy. ��2. The beer - AWARD WINNING for a reason. ��My favorites are the Dark n Curvy and the Worryin Ale. ��They also have a great bottle list in case you want to have something outside of their own brew.3. ��The appetizers - a very short list, but the warm spinach and tomato dip is very tasty.4.

"Needed to update this review. Remember how I had mentioned they had taken away our dining table during the middle of our meal in order to move us and accommodate a large group of diners who had just arrived? After the group's table was set up, they sat down. ?Then, suddenly the group stood up and walked out of the restaurant..."
"My sister had an event for work at Sunda last night. ��I have never heard her so upset so I was compelled to write about how horrible it was. ��Tenia was the name of the girl she worked with and she was so rude and unaccommodating. ��Neither my sister or I ��would ever come back here based on the service she was given during her event as my sister who does events often said you can find better sushi and better customer service at Shaw's, Japonais, Hub 51 or Union Sushi. ��Take your money someplace else Sunda doesn't appreciate it."
"Had the braised short rib torta, carnita bowl and churros. Everything was fantastic!"
"It's all about Buds. It's all about those two senses you almost lost drinking mgd and eating buffalo wings all the time. Prepare yourself for a transformation. Take your nose for a ride; put your taste buds to a test. Loose yourself in this wonderful journey of aromas, flavors and textures. Forget wine tasting. It's not challenging enough anymore.This is ultimate test of your brain capabilities. Turn of your cell phone forget your girlfriend. Focus. Transport yourself ?to a different time and place. Nirvana is just two sips away. Pay attention to the Magicians/Pharmacist/Gourmet Chef pretending to be your bartender. ?Watch carefully their skillful hands creating your ticket to happiness.

"Excellent, excellent burger and beer. I tried their Bottom Up Belgian Wit with a Smokehouse burger that was just awesome. Great flavors for both...I tried the a couple of the other beers that people had at my table and they were all enjoyable.It's a bit pricy, but not outrageous, and definitely loud, but I will be back for sure."
"Yummy food, great service. We tried the homemade honey wine -- it was very good. Highly recommend!"
"I've never had Ethiopian before, so I was a little bit nervous. ��I always like to try to find the menu online beforehand, so I could get an idea of what I'm in for. ��I found a number of things I'd be interested in trying, but I needn't have done that, because the group I dine with decided to order as a group, and not individually. ��We had an eclectic mix of vegetarian and meat dishes, and there was not one thing I did not enjoy! The wait staff was very friendly and informative, explaining all the dishes as well as the drinks that were brought. ��The food was so good, I can't wait to go back! ��The ONLY downside is we did not ask for utensils, and as we were utilizing the bread base to eat with, we all got full rather quickly, leaving a lot left over. ��In all fairness, I could give the restau"
Excellent
"Best upscale dining experience in Chicago to date. I had the privilege of going to Sunday brunch yesterday with my friend and we had a 5 star experience. It had been rumored that in order to get a table, you had to have a reservation at least a week in advance, so I followed the protocol and made a reservation for 2 at 10:30a.m. I watched Dale on Top Chef and he was my favorite! I was like an excited, school girl waiting for the doors to open. From the moment we walked in, we were treated like royalty. The service was amazing. They took our plates as soon as we were finished with the appetizer, brought us fresh silverware for the main course, and our glasses were never below half full. Ambiance: Before reviewing the menu I was taking in everything about the restaurant. We sat in the middle"
"Nice restaurant. Would definetly come back, food was really good and a great experiance for anyone that has not had Ethiopian Food before. The ethiopian beer was very good."
"Apart from that special-night-out-feeling that Sunda lets you have, I am also happy to say that their food is excellent, while the service is friendly, discrete and professional. We love Asian food and Sunda offers both ��innovative as well as delicious dishes! We ordered sushi rolls, the pork tuna salad, truffle soaked tuna, the 'toast and jam', Malaysian fish..it was a great dinner (for my husband's b-day) and we look forward to a next visit!"
"I've been going to Alliance for years. They serve Intelligentsia coffee and it's good. Sometimes the pastries are hit or miss - want to know what's always a hit??? The cinnamon rolls. I'm not sure what they put in them... might be crack in the icing... because once you have one you'll start thinking about ways to get another... and another. It's dangerous. Other Alliance Goodness: Free wi-fi, great place to study, outdoor seating, good service, friendly staff."
What can I say? ��By far the best restaurant in all of Chicago
"So against my will i went to try them again (girlfriends idea), she said we should order ahead so when we walk the 5 mins it takes to cross the street it will be there, and we can enjoy lunch and not spend most of it starving. ��Ok, so at 11:55am i call them and tell them i want to place an order, extra cheese caramelized crust, simple. I ask how long will it take to make it, she says approx 25-30 mins, ok so i tell her i work right across the street and i will walk over there at 12:25. everything seems to be going good, I'm in high hopes. Arrive there, everyone was friendly, seated in a corner booth, for more than 2, not the one we wanted but ill take it. So after saying multiple times that i ordered ahead, they finally understand. so here comes 11:50 roughly 20 mins after we were seated, "
"This is probably my favorite restaurant! The drive from the south suburbs is well worth it, and we've never been disappointed by this place. We always get so much for our money--we typically order two appetizers, soup, two entrees, and sometimes dessert--and our bill is pretty reasonable (and there are ALWAYS tasty leftovers). The ��staff is very friendly and they always remember us, even if we haven't visited in several months. The best part is that even when you're stuffed, it's not a why-did-I-eat-that stuffed. The food isn't heavy or greasy, and you can actually have a very healthy meal here."
"This is my first review (new to the whole yelp scene) and I just had to start with my favorite bar in the neighborhood.The beer selection is incredible. ��Anyone who goes to Hopleaf will find something they love...or have a really good time tasting their way down the beer list until they do! ��It's a Belgian-style joint but there is beer from around the world. ��They also have some tasty mead choices and wine.Hopleaf has it covered when it comes to comfort food, as well. ��The mussles are fabulous. ��There is always a great selection of cheeses and sausages and the toasted nuekse ham sandwich is absolutely delicious! Aside from the wonderful libations, the place has such a great vibe. ��I have gone a number of times by myself and have always ended up meeting someone friendly. ��The music doesn't "
"I love this place, it's great!!! And now that they have delivery it's even better. I have to give the credit for delivering to me in downtown. There all the way in 4600 N, i'm at 800 N, yet they delivered without a question. great food, great service, a customer for life."
"Two things - Incredibly slow delivery, far far beyond the hour they say it will take - and I live 4 blocks away. The other... the food arrives cold. Slow delivery. cold food. um, um, yuck! Just order from somewhere else."
"They have great food, good service, and if you phone in a carryout order it is usually ready within 15 minutes. ��If you choose to dine in, the atmosphere is pleasant and it is a byob."
"If you asked me to review Icosium Kafe two weeks ago, I would have given a 5 star rating, no question. Unfortunately, that has changed.... After my last visit this past Friday, I'm not sure that I will ever return. I suspect that many of these rave reviews are soon to change upon their next visit. Everything has changed. The crepes that were once over sized and stuffed with a variety of amazing fillings are now meek little cigars that make me oh so sad. When I asked about the price change, I was told that the crepes were too expensive and this is more affordable. Not true. The crepe that once cost approximately $9.50 came with soup and would more than accomplish it's job in filling you up. Now, crepes cost $6 each and you would need to get two to come close to satisfying your hunger. This "
"Don't make reservations!!!! Never again!!!! �� �� ��Thank you so much Brazzaz!!! ��You took my reservation 3 days prior when I called your establishment. ��Then tonight, our anniversary, you say you don't have our reservation???? ��The only resolution is to rebook our reservation and we would wait 2 hours plus like walk-ins??? ��After reading some past reviews, this seems to be somewhat common. How unprofessional?? ��You have lost our future business and future recommendations!!"
"Been here twice, found it thoroughly underwhelming both times, especially when there are significantly better restaurants in Chicago that deserve more hype.Service is a bit tacky, with waiters sprinkling in odd bits of faux-italian when they're talking to you.Food often comes in massive portions (never a good sign), but quantity clearly doesn't deliver on quality. The pasta I had was about an hour past al dente, the risotto on another visit was curiously gummy, the beet salad was limp and flavorless.The setting is nice, but they need to do a lot more work on improving the kitchen."
If your looking for an escape from the daily grind or just want a great place to eat at a reasonable price then The 3rd Coast is the place to be! The laid back atmosphere and attentive staff makes you feel right at home. The menu has something for everyone especially for guys like me who enjoy a good breakfast anytime of the day!!
"What a rip off! I took my wife there for a nice meal and here is what we had: we split the calamari which was very good, I had the lobster bisque which was nothing more than tangy tomato soup with no hint of lobster, the seafood sampler that came with a good (small) crab cake, scallops that were bland, and 3 grilled shrimp that were so over cooked they tasted like leather. My wife had a shrimp cocktail, hard to screw up, and the crab cake appetizer for $15!!! For a single crab cake! Then we split the moosetracks ice cream which was soooo frozen that we had to use a knife to cut through it. With 2 drinks each it came to $120. I wouldn't have paid $40 for that meal. Next time I'm going back to Bone Fish."
"Based on a recommendation, I took my wife for her birthday. ��It was absolutely delightful, from fare to atmosphere. ��My wife- ��she loved it too and she has a very high standards. ��We will definitely go back."
"I will NEVER go to this place again.My boyfriend and I had made reservations for Valentines day over the weekend. As soon as we got there, they told us that even though we had a 6 o'clock reservation, we would not be seated until 7 because of how many delays they were experiencing. My boyfriend explained to him that we had tickets to see ""Million Dollar Quartet"" at 8 so we needed to be seated as soon as possible. The hostess said that she understood, but they had overbooked for the weekend. While we were waiting for our reservation to be filled, a man walked in with his date asking for a talbe and was told that they could not seat him because it was reservation only. He must have slipped the hostess some cash because he was seated 45 MINUTES before us and still sitting at a table near us w"
"Great, great, great, creative menu, definitely a treat. ��I loved the atmosphere. ��The service is what makes this place stand out from many fine dining establishments in Chicago and New York, it was such fun to watch, like synchronized swimming. ��Impeccable. ��I loved having the menu with our anniversary date on it as well as our names, so sweet, and something to cherish and remember the night by. ��Fine dining at its best."
"My favorite neighborhood sushi!! Great atmosphere, good staff, quick service, fresh ingredients, BYOB although connected to a unique little Asian-inspired bar you can wait in or drink at after, love it!! I'm always pleased at Wakamono, I've been there countless times, the only downfall is how packed it gets on weekends, so try for a week night.. and It's totally worth the extra dollar or two per roll. Alaskan roll is amazing!! Totally recommend!!"
"great lengua, great burritos, and very good everything else. byob doesn't hurt. 5 stars if i am eating here late-night."
"Insanely good. ��I had flashbacks sitting in little Guandong holes eating the best BBQ i've had outside of China. ��Seriously, their BBQ pork is no joke and doesn't pull punches.There is something to be said about a place that has a wait for a table for 2 close to 45 minutes, but instead you can choose to spend a cool sawbuck and walk out with Pork/Duck combo over rice in less than 5 min. ��This place is true to it's bones and easily the best in the area... I haven't had their Peking Duck (with all the accompaniments) but I have had some over rice and it's delicious.They take reservations so don't hesitate! ��However, how is this restaurant closed on a Thursday night??!!"
"I will admit that I still wonder why do people waist their time and wait in long lines, but thats just me a go guy looking for affordable quality. ��I was there for a birthday party and reallyt enjoyed myself. The food was delicious and the service excellent. Thank you!"
You can't go wrong with Rick Bayless
Great food. ��No complaints. ��Loved the atmosphere. Knowledgeable and helpful servers. ��Fried green tomato BLT. ��Best split pea soup (Even if you don't like split pea soup--TRY THIS!). ��My boyfriend had the fried chicken. ��I just don't think you can go wrong here!
"Good Chinese Style BBQ!!! The food seems fresh and fairly priced. Go for the small BBQ combination(good value over there), try all of the meats, check out which one you like better.The BBQ skin duck is really tasty.If you go with a group, go for the Whole Duck BBQ, its a nice experience, they actually cut it all for you and serve it to the group... Good Stuff!!!"
"I am definitely a fan of Rick Bayless having watched his show Mexico One Plate at a Time as well as watching him compete on Top Chef Masters. ?My review is based on my only visit so far and the one item I got which was the Wild Mushroom Torta. ?It's one of the vegetarian options and although I'm not totally vegetarian, I do like to incorporate vegetarian meals in my diet. The torta itself was a great idea although for my tastes I found it a bit too salty . ?It came with some kind of crumbly goat cheese, and the wild mushrooms were also seasoned of course. ?The baguette-type bread the torta came in was a little hard in texture also but I suppose this is needed so the entire sandwich doesn't become a soggy mess. ?Overall though it was a little hard to eat and could get a bit messy (I ordered"
"I had never before been to a costa rican restaurant, and wasn't sure what to expect. ��But, my companion and I were new and town and decided to try something new. ��The restaurant is right off the blue line, and it's BYOB, which is great.If you like Mexican food, but you've never tried any other south American food, you should give Irazu a try. ��The portions were a good size, and everything tasted great. ��Their rice is very good. ��The beef is good as well. ��They have a nice menu of specials, another plus. ��chips and salsa were good as well.We sat outside b/c we went in late September and their patio was nice. ��The building is pretty small, so if you go on Friday/Sat. night, you might have to wait a bit for a table, but you can always have a beer or something while you wait.looking forward to"
i like this place because its ready made and super quick when im tired after a long day at work. ��It's also pretty darn good!
"What can I say about Doug's that everyone else hasn't already said? It's amazing! I've been going for around 2 years now (minus that 7 month stint I lived in Brooklyn) and I'm so happy to see how popular the restaurant has gotten. (Not to mention wildly jealous that he hung out with Anthony Bourdain.)The long lines are a drag but it gives you plenty of time to catch up on all your Words With Friends games and ponder which specials will be up on the board that week. Or.. skip out on work, go to Doug's around 2:30pm mid-week, and there's generally never more than 10 people in line. I haven't read all 1,000+ reviews, so I'm sure it's been noted, but for anyone who has never been, don't try to run inside and snag a table while someone else in your party holds the spot in line. It's rude to eve"
"I only waited 10 minutes while sitting at the bar in front of all of the so very busy bartenders and even then had to ask the barback for a glass of wine. He might I add was so very nice and professional. ?Then, minutes later one of the blond bartenders hands me my glass of wine with my check out and a curt thank you. Seriously, I have been treated better at McDonalds! ?I really do not think I would have been the courtesy of a hello if it was not for the great bar helper whose name I did not get. ?I guess must be so busy that it forgets to say hello or ask if you would like something to drink.I don't feel it is that great of place to have to wait or be treated so rudely to come back. ?I told the manager, Nick of my experience and he listened as they all do and politely ask I come back(for "
"One of my favorite Chicago breakfast spots! Super family, kid, and baby friendly. The coffee and cheese grits are a must. My 10 month old loves the colorful walls and toy store next door.Very helpful, fast, and nice wait staff and parking is plentiful on side streets."
"Our group was shocked by how rude the staff were. We arrived @ 6:40, which was only 10 minutes after our reservation. The extremely rude host told us we are 15 minutes late and they had to cancel our reservation. We told him we are only 10 minutes late and ready to be seated. Then he asked if our entire party was here. I said we're missing one person, but we are ordering for everyone. He said if everyone wasn't present in 5 minutes, then they will have to cancel our reservation. The rest of our party arrived with the 5 minutes. Then the host came back to us and said he called us earlier in the day to confirm our reservation, but since we didn't call back to confirm, it was canceled.Why didn't they mention this in the first place? Why give us a hard time about being 10 mins late and not hav"
Great place to go for cocktails! Chic atmosphere and all around fun time
"It was my birthday on May 26, 2011. ��I called 3 days prior to make a reservation. ��Spoke with a woman on the phone (ie. Not Open Table). ��We arrived and they did not have our reservation. ��The host/manager looking guy asked several times about how we made our reso but seated us right away (nice recovery)--BTW, never told them I was celebrating a birthday. What was off-putting to me, was that as our server (finally--longer than expected) came to the table, I was opening some birthday cards at the table and I told him ""I'm opening some birthday cards"", and he said, ""are you telling me this so I'll give you a free dessert?"" ��Awk moment. ��Natch we told him no. He struck up a convo with my husband about fishing that was unusually long (ok, I can over look this), but then when he gave us dessert"
"Disappointing experience at Frontera Grill. When my meal arrived after ?receiving the wrong entree, steak was overdone and sweet corn tamales tepid. My companion received undercooked bitter rice 10 mins after his entree. Server was unapologetic, saying mistakes happen. Yes, we made a mistake thinking Frontera would be as good as when we dined here several times a month. I was excited when we spotted Rick Bayless in the kitchen- but Bayless is master chef no more."
My date and I dined at Shaw's on Thursday night. Our reservations were honored right away. The waiter was a little slow. The waiter did apologized. We order calamari which was great but it was the smallest size ��that I have ever had. My date ordered the crab cake which was excellent. I ordered the fried shrimp which was more than enough 8 very large prawns. Fries came with the shrimp but they were awful. They were over cooked and very hard to digest. This was my first time in the formal ��dining room. I usually eat in the oyster bar. For now on I will stick with the oyster bar. I will order the Lobster rolls wish are great (no fries).
"Forget any notions about veggie restaurants not satisfying your hunger if you eat meat. I've dined here a few times, and everything I've tried has been really good.You'll spend a little more, but the quality of the food and service is worth it. Good choice if you're in the neighborhood. Parking can be a challenge, though."
"I love Hopleaf. Everybody I know loves Hopleaf. It's the best gastropub I've ever been to, and one of my favorite places in Chicago.Hopleaf has the best beer in Chicago -- everyone knows that. I don't think I even need to say anything about the beer -- it's truly the best in Chicago. But the food is incredible, too. The CB&J is awesome -- simply awesome. And the fries are the kind of fries I find myself daydreaming about. Oh, delicious fries...Everything on the menu is great. My girlfriend swears by the Heirloom Tomato salad, the onion rings are amazing, and the mac and cheese side is exactly as good as you hope it's going to be.If you're vegetarian, it's the kind of place where you take a quick look at the menu and pretty much know what you're getting. (They used to have a polenta dish th"
"Well, they have maintained their quality of service and food yet once again. ��This was a repeat visit and well worth it. ��Service staff is outstanding and friendly from the valet, to the front desk, to the table. ��Bravo!!! ��The Chefs did an excellent job on the appetizers, soups, main courses and the deserts. ��I would highly recommend this restaurant to the avid Greek restaurant goers to the adventurous looking to take on a world of new flavors for their taste buds. ��I have eaten in many Greek restaurants both in the US and in Greece and would rank this restaurant in the top ten category. ��A must for anyone who likes Greek food or looking to try something new."
"Sprout was amazing. If you go, do the tasting menu- it is worth it. My favorite dish of the night was the licorice salad. Sounds weird, I know, but it's so good! We went the night we were engaged and we got free champagne to celebrate. The staff was wonderful."
"I have been going to Coast for years! I love love love it! Good sushi that is simple but tasty and the best thing is it is a BYOB, my favorite type of place! Save money and still feel like you can afford a lux sushi dinner."
"Living in an area where there are Mexican restaurants on every block, and none of them particularly interesting, I was looking forward to Frontera Grill. ��I have to say that everything we ordered was very good. ��The flavors were fresh and distinctive, and the presentation was very good as well. ��Although it was still crowded when we arrived at 2:30 PM on a Saturday, we got a table immediately and our service was good throughout the meal. ��With restaurants that have received considerable national attention, it's sometimes safer to plan for a meal not at one of the peak times. ��The line for XOCO was ridiculous, out the door and down the block. ��Considering that it's the same food as Frontera Grill, I'd have been a lot less willing to spend that much time waiting for take-out food."
"My husband treated me to Fogo de Chao for my birthday. If you are a meat lover - look no farther. It is the absolutely best place in the entire city of Chicago. The staff working together to serve each of the tables, you get full attention.The way they serve their meat is unique. The meat is fresh and is many to choose from. Great food, expenxive - but it is well worth the occasional visit. You won't be disappointed. All the good comes with a high price tag :-)"
"This is the only place where I have wanted to pay to leave with 6 courses remaining. ��And others at my table wanted to leave before that! ��It is all flash and little substance. ��If gimmicks, pomp and salty, fatty, goop is what you want, you will get plenty of it at Alinea, unfortunately, you won't get much else."
"in a neighborhood filled with good food options, this humble cafe on the corner often gets overlooked. ��personally, it took me a few years of living in the hood to finally try this place out. ��boy, was i missing out on something!my boyfriend and i went on a sunday morning, and there was no wait - perfect. ��we had the amazing turkish coffee and then split a bowl of seasonal fruit, complete with sliced almonds and mango chutney. ��now, as someone who eats fruit on a daily basis, it takes a lot to make fruit stand out, but ��this was the best fruit bowl i have ever tasted - literally!! ��i've been thinking about it ever since....for our meal, we each turned one of their crepes into an omelette and we were both delighted by the yumminess. ��the ratio of ingredients to egg was superb, which is not "
"Crisp is the Shit.Great food, awesome service, great food, awesomeness.I love Crisp. Everyone should go."
Great service great atmosphere great food will go back frequently
I love Sultan's.. so fast. healthy. I only wish they had even more menu options and they got someone out to wash the tables down in betweendiners.I recently took my sister in for her very first falafel. What's that? she asked... GASP!She is now ADDICTED.
"this is a great little sneaky place that has some wonderfully authentic costa rican food. ��it is family owned and run which just adds to the draw. ��the food is amazing and for the price prob one of the better deals in the city, the horchata is ridiculous too. ��it is byo and in the summer if you can get by the baby stroller parking lot they have a great little outdoor patio that faces west so late sunny days are perfect. ��go for the boiled yucca with garlic and the chicken casado with gallo pinto, ��pura vida!!! ��say hello to Henry too as he is finally back from CR to enjoy the rest of winter with us poor souls."
"I'll say for delivery they do just fine. Standard 45-50min wait, (and I live at 5400 N. Any st. drive) but get this, they delivered a complimentary beef pho with all the trimmings: bean sprouts, lime, mint leaves, etc. literally etc..and I was in shock. And they comped some other stuff just because it was Tuesday. ��Good stuff!"
"At the advice of some friends, we had made reservations at Caro Mio for dinner. ?We're from Canada and are in town to run the marathon on Sunday. ?Although a long cab ride from our downtown hotel, we were eagerly anticipatipating some great Italian food and the wonderful American hospitality we've come to expect. ?After a $20 cab ride, we arrive only to find out that since we had originally made the reservation for six, the fact that we were only 4 people, we would have to wait even though we could see our table empty and waiting for us. ?As far as we could see, there were no other diners waiting for tables. ? We couldn't believe our ears!!! ?We explained that we'd just driven 9 hours from Canada and come here because we were told it was great . ?The fact that two of our friends backed out"
"I'm giving it two stars for the environment they have created inside not for the service or the food. Now to the food, first off my order was messed up and instead of turkey I got lamb, I don't see how that could have been done. Secondly it took unusually long for the food considering it's just ONE crepe.There was no apology as to the mess up in the order. I went to the place hoping to make it one of my favorite spots after reading so many good reviews but sadly I will not be going there again."
"Went with my family on a weekday; it was easy to get a table. I had an omelet, which was light, but lacked flavor. The apple butter with the toast was awesome. The potatoes were plain and salty. Definitely lacked the sophistication I expected from the chef, and needs improvement. My husband had a few eggs and pancakes. The pancakes were ridiculously wonderful, and his eggs were better than my omelet. I will have what he had on our next visit. ��Also, we both had raspberry mochas, and agreed they were the best coffee drinks we've ever had. Now that I know what to order, I think it's worth the money. We will visit often!"
"Still not very fond of this place. Came back a 2nd time and tried some other options off the menu and it all just came back very bland. Ive eaten at other vietnamese resturants and the food has so much flavor! but tank noodles always skimps out on flavor, and fills up the dish with too much raw vegetables (a nice gimmick to keep the prices high and the actual food portion low)."
I have been getting sushi X delivery for years but there is one dish that stands out for me and its the spicy tuna salad. ��I love that its basically the inside of a spicy tuna roll on a salad of greens topped with avocado. ��The best thing is that it is an entire meal for $9 there is soo much tuna on top. ��I have to admit that there have been some issues with a couple of orders over the years but the customer service is great. They fixed any problems quickly and very courteously and what more could you ask?
beats a kick in the nuts
"Staff is super nice, the food is really enjoyable and light with unique flavors, and the atmosphere is upbeat and just fun. Bar is a little pricey but also has delicious unique cocktails. I am somewhat boring and like the shaking beef (it's paired with a lime sauce that works perfectly) but the soup dumplings and beef lollipops are also great. Sushi is not normally my thing, but I enjoy it here."
The food was great! ...http://forksandcorkschicago.com/2011/01/30/90-�_miles-and-running/
I've tried to like this restaurant. ��A few times. ��My friends and some family like it... ��but I just can't seem to enjoy it. ��There are far better places in Pilsen...
"Irazu serves good food: many beans, sweet things and lots of other things. We always get a coke and the milkshake."
"Delicious food, and amazing vibe from this rustic and cozy location! Only issue was that the waitress was wearing a very low cut shirt and made and effort to make that apparent; this fact made my girlfriend and I feel mildly uncomfortable."
"Having been at Gilt bar twice now, I wanted to wait to write a review based on how new this place was. First of all, this Gilt Bar has nothing to do with Gilt bar NY. The atmosphere is very elegant, dark and cozy, sexy and intimate all at the same time which is surprising for such a big space.The first thing you should know about the menu is that the pricing reflects some of the most inexpensive food you can get in river north these days. The cuisine is rustic, inventive with very fresh notes (homemade pastas, etc) and with the owner's background, I would have not expected anything less quite frankly. The wine list features most of the wines under $30 and both times I dined here, the sommelier recommended a great bottle.Overall, service was friendly and attentive and, if we might have wait"
Great for a date and movie. Alittle busy and loud if you want a quiet andi intimate dinner.
"I like the most of their food. One cold dish is not so great. Other than that, everything taste nice..."
"Excellent pizza, excellent spinach dip, excellent karaoke Thursday nights. ��Everything is great about this place. ��You stay away it's mine!!!"
"I just love this place. I love how everyone goes here, from the working class to the wicker park hipsters. I love the ever rotating sellection of sausage and I especially love the duck fat fries. I have never had a bad experience and doug is such a sweety!"
"Best restaurant in Chicago by far! ��From the moment you walk in it is a beautiful journey. ��I was nervous because I just dined at Moto, and it was poor at best.The inside of the restaurant is breath-taking. ��The service and food is impeccable. ��The servers were not in my face, but if i needed something they were right there to help. ��There were different homemade breads with every course just getting better and better. ��Moto needs to take notes on how to cook and execute! ��I opted for the 22 course because my husband insisted, ��but I was so enthralled that we did. ��It lasted about 4+ hours, but went by so fast. ��I have only heard about the hot potato cold potato- and i still am thinking about it! ��I asked the server if the chef could sign my menu, and he DID!! Truly, a memorable experience"
"MMMMM....I went twice in one week! Chicago has such a variety of food choices, but it's hard to find a good soul food restaurant. I liked that they stick to a specialty and didn't have a 6 page menu but proved that they could do one thing well: COMFORT FOOD!Wishbone isn't expensive and I appreciate the two sides included on entrees. It's not grandma's Sunday dinner...but it's close!"
"BAD CRAPPLE!! ��FALSE ADVERTISING - BAD BUSINESSI would strongly suggest not attending nor supporting this bar! They false advertised their prices on their website, and when this was brought up in a polite manner, the owner Craig was unreasonable and extremely rude! ��Upon realizing their falsely advertised prices, I very cordially informed him of the fact that pricing at the bar was significantly higher (over 20% more) than clearly stated on THEIR OWN website (which I verified at home later that night that I didn't miss something and i was at fault) - his reponse was to lecture me on his woes of paying his staff. keeping his bar open, and that he was not a webmaster and therefore not responsible for what was on THEIR OWN website and they would not honor what was advertisied. Too much info!!"
Decided to take my buddy there for his 32nd Birthday along with my Girlfriend and Daughter... We made reservations for 7:30PM and arrived at the parking lot adjacent to the restaurant which was nice as they validate and it only cost $12 which is far better then the $32 it would have cost had they not. Upon entering we were promptly greeted by the host and seated within minutes. After sitting the waiter Antonio showed up shortly after and we were on our way. Pulled out my Daughter and Girlfriends chair which they blushed at and then we were off to the salad bar. I found the salad bar better then the one in Schaumburg but the Girlfriend says it is not... The Waiter was fantastic and attentive and my Daughter was over whelmed with joy and had the time of her life everytime she flipped over he
"I received some promo card that Sunda is now open for lunch. ��Hey, any new river north lunch area is great, so I tried it out with some colleagues yesterday. ��When we walked in, we were greated by a friendly hostess at an awkard host stand, told her we were three people to become four. ��We were seated at a hard to get to table, but hey, its lunch, whatever goes goes. ��The decor was great, but they needed more noise reduction material, I had to shout accross my 2 foot table to talk to everyone, and the place was only half full. ��Our server was very lax. ��It took him about 10 minutes to get our drinks, and another 15 to take our order - not good in a business district lunch spot. ��We ordered sushi to not waste any more time. ��When the fourth member of our party joined, it took 8 minutes (tim"
"We were visiting Chicago for several days from out of state. Eating out all the time can be really expensive but we wanted at least one great sit down meal. ��I highly recommend Wildfire. It is a moderately priced alternative to Gibson's or Morton's that will not disappoint. ��I'll start with the food. Our party split two appetizers. ��A small thin sausage pizza and a goat cheese dip of some sort. ��The goat cheese was so-so. The pizza was very good. ��Next was a greek salad. Very tasty with a nice mix of feta cheese and garbanzo beans. Highly recommend the filet trio for your main dish. ��You can try their different crusts that come with their steaks. ��I went with the horseradish, mushroom, and parmesan cheese. Terrific dish. ��We split a piece of key lime pie for desert. ��The service. Our waite"
"it is all good - but salad bar is great all meat is very salty - so you fill up on drinks and salad �� , o well"
"I'm usually the type of person who thinks that places like this are completely overrated. This is NOT the case with Sunda. Sunda was the best meal I have had in a long time. I went with my parents, brother, and boyfriend on a Saturday night. We had a pretty early reservation for 6:30 PM and they definitely don't screw around with their on-time policy. If your entire party is not there within 15 minutes, they give away your table. No questions asked. We were seated at the bar, and while initially annoyed, it turned out to be a great experience. Why?The bartender (who is supposedly a reality tv star) was SO nice and took charge of ordering for our table asking us only what we definitely would NOT eat. The best dishes included: spicy tuna roll and the brussel sprout salad (who would think!?),"
"Overrated.However, I will start with the positives...- Very nice, friendly wait staff and busboys. ��Prompt and helpful without being overbearing.- Great gelati! ��Pleasantly surprised. ��Truthfully, I just wanted something cold in the heat (we'll get to that in a second), and it shocked me with the subtle and memorable flavor!- The bread is good.But, the negatives outweighed the positives...- Hot as h-e-double-hockey-sticks in there. ��It's called air conditioning - use it. ��- I felt crammed in like a sardine. ��Look, if I wanted to be on a date with the sweathog @ the next table (he was affected by the temp too), I'd ask him out. ��I'm not asking for a private room...all I want is to be able to feel like I could move my arms without checking to see if I elbowed said sweathog.- Appetizers & ent"
Best Chicago latenight pizza. I wouldnt survive without this place!
"This is the best place in our neighborhood to dine, ��breakfast , lunch and dinner. ��It is mr kitchen"
"Fun atmosphere, great food...but no Thai Grill. ��English was a little broken, but I guess that proves true ethnicity! ��I stuck to Thai versus Sushi; it was reasonably priced. ��I would recommend the Indie Cafe; however, will not become a 'regular' anytime soon..."
Extremely awful customer service but very good hot pot.
Cool bar with GREAT beer selection and BAD service.
"Since the hostess & our waitress were incapable of handling the crowd (at least when we were there), we practically had to beg for their attention the entire time. ��It took awhile to even get our name down for a table. ��The server was so overwhelmed, she walked away while I was mid-sentence talking to her at one point. ��When she finally decided to quit chatting and running around empty-handed after we'd waited an hour and a half for our food, we were rewarded with a dried-up room temperature pizza. ��Because we have eaten there many times before, we know that when more adequate employees are scheduled the dining experience can be amazing. ��Not this time, though. ��:/"
"I love this place. ��It's very quick and easy to get a bite here at anytime during the week. ��Somehow there always seems to be at least one extra table where you can get a seat. ��The prices are very good and it's a great first date place. ��It may not be fancy, but the atomsphere is very good and it's easy to get to know someone here. ��At the same time, my family wants to go here all the time when they are in town. ��The food is very good too. I suggest the sandwhiches or artopitas. ��Also, always go with the pasta salad over the potatoe salad."
"This establishment has the best beer selection in Lincoln Square/North Center by far. Go just to have a beer or two, add an appetizer and a burger. I recommend the Warm Goat Cheese Fondue Dip and the Edmund Fig-Gerald burger. This is a family/kid-friendly restaurant, so expect some screaming if you're there before 7pm."
"Right on, Matt B. ��I took my wife here for her birthday this past June. ��What a mistake. ��I can't even remember the fare, all I remember is that it was inferior to what we've eaten at Everest, Alinea, Blackbird, Bistro Campagne, etc. �� What I do remember is that the jerk who served us (who I understand is also the chef/owner) scoffed at our decision to arrive sans wine (wife was pregnant), perhaps concluding that we were unsophisticated, one-time tourists. ��The rest of the evening, his service was at best standoffish, as if it was a nuisance to deal with us. �� Does he think he's such a great culinary artiste that he doesn't need to treat his customers with warmth and courtesy? ��In a town teeming with Mozarts, he is a Salieri."
"I love The Bad Apple! ��Great food, great beer, and friendly staff. ��Certainly refreshing compared to some of the other bar/pubs in the area. ��Welcome to the neighborhood!"
"Must taste it to believe!!!Good Points: ��Best, the sauce is perfect and love the burnt edges. Get fresh garlic on top it makes it spicier but so good. ��Their pizza is not too thick with fillings like GIordanos or Lou Malnottis, its better. ��They are only rivaled by one pizza in the city of chicago and that is My Pie.Bad points: ��the only thing bad about the deep dish is it has too thick of bread on the bottom and not a lot of cheese, i wish they would thin it out! �� It's like eating a huge amount of bread. ��Last, everything else here besides the pizza is disgusting, do not get appetizers or pasta, stick to just pizza."
"Big Jones provides a superlative dining experience. ��The cocktails are ""spot on"", the staff is attentive, young, and hip, and the food is delicious and healthy - suprising for Southern food. ��I have to say that I don't necessarily love the South, but I love Big Jones - a little bit of Alice Waters influenced to be sure... NorCal southern with a great cocktail and wine list that compliments the culinary adventures available. ��I especially love their brunch.P.S. ��Que C is trippin! ��He doesn't know shit from apple butter!"
One of my most fav restaurants in the area. The torta is succulent and the presentation of the dishes are nice. I had a wonderful waiter very knowledgeable and friendly.
Love this place! BYOB. Try the lobster ravioli. Delicious.
"I had lunch there and was excited because of the positive things that I've heard. ��I asked the waitress for a recommendation...she didn't understand English and offered little help. ��I decided to order my old stand by...shrimp with lobster sauce. ��I also ordered egg drop soup, which I thought was pretty good....very flavorful. �� The shrimp with lobster sauce had canned peas and carrots, canned mushrooms and canned water chestnuts. ��I complained and was offered something different. ��I asked for fried shrimp and spring rolls. �� The owner, chef came over and explained that szechuan cuisine doesn't use fresh vegetables, that they always use canned vegetables!!! �� I looked at the website, where they boast on their use of fresh vegetables. He went on to say that noone uses fresh vegetables in sz"
"Serious disappointment. I brought my wife here for her 44th birthday. We were given the best table in the house and that's where the fun ended. Our service was slow and apathetic once it was clear we weren't going to spend $400.00. We did spend $200.00 and got two glasses of wine, two beers and the chef's tasting menu of the most disconnected flavors I have ever experienced. When we complimented the one decent dish (rabbit w/ sour cherries) the server's response was yeah, everyone likes that one. We ordered lobster and were served the most pathetic langostine I have ever seen. In short...pretty much everything was over cooked and then set to luke warm..and we both found ourselves being able to make only so much conversation and complimenting of the surroundings between tastings before we f"

"This place rocks! ��The food is awesome! ��You can do casual or fancy. ��Fries with elk ragout (it's very good) and a beer, or a lovely piece of fish with an intersting high/end preparation and a glass of wine.We've been here several times, and it's always a winner.It's popular, so it can get noisy - but the food is worth it."
"Hands Down 5 star rating for Sabatinos.I love everything about This restaurant.  ��Staff are very warm and friendly, they welcome you like a regular customer. Food was always excellent. Very nice ambience, good place to celebrate a nice date, anniversary, birthday or just a simple dinner.Very nice, friendly staff, makes you feel welcome And come back.I just love Sabatinos. Good Job guys."
"LOVE IT. The house band alone is great live music, and seems most people go just to see them. Only been here a few times, but each time I met new people very easily, everybody is just friendly and cool! No dirty looks, no trouble, no attitude. WHEW! Glad I walked in."
"My Oldest daughter woke up yesterday morning asking me if we were going to meet the beautiful Indian Lady at the restaurant. ��I realized my daughter was asking me about the India House restaurant we went to last weekend, and the girl who greeted us and seated us at our table. Both my daughters were amazed by her Indian Costume and she was supernice talking to our daughters and answering their questions, so they now think we would go there every Saturday as they heard me telling the girl as she was seeing us off that we will be going back there for sure. This was our First experience to Indian Food as a family, even though my Husband had tried it several times before, and it was his strong recommendation that finally made us decide to introduce Indian Cuisine at India House to our kids.

"Let's see, where to begin...I made reservations a month in advance for some friends visiting from Boston - old friends. This place was recommended by two good friends, one who works at a restaurant and one who has even helped the chefs prep. Highest recommendations - allegedly a great time.I was contacted yesterday to confirm my reservation. Today I was contacted again to confirm my reservation (by the same person - Seth) which is kind of retarded considering I specifically confirmed my reservation the day before over the phone. At 5pm I received an obsequious call - we're sorry, the chef has been called away, we have to cancel for the night. Is there anything we can do so that you don't hate us? This was at 5pm for an 8pm reservation, after I had confirmed twice. I asked what that meant -"
"the best kebab in town,kebobs are full of flavor, moist and cooked to perfection.every dish i had was great!"
"Luckily, after all the buzz about Longman & Eagle, I went last night for a friend's birthday. The food was astounding...I almost couldn't believe what was happening in my mouth. I started with a 2 oz glass of Rittenhouse Rye and we tried the roasted beet salad with goat cheese, candied walnuts and bacon vinaigrette. The smoky bacon flavor and earthy beets were an extraordinary pairing, finished with a smooth, milky goat cheese. We also had the kobe meatballs with cheesy polenta. I don't know what happened but I think it made me black out for a minute.For my entree I had the kobe burger with cheddar and neuski bacon and beef fat fries. I have to say that my burger was a little overdone but given my ravenous appetite the thrill of the moment, I soldiered on. The bacon was mind-blowing, fries"
more than 5 * in my book!
"Checked this place out with a couple friends today. The atmosphere is very cool. The food was very good. I ordered the Flemish Beef Stew which was delicious. Also tried the wings and the fish and chips. The wings had a good flavor with just the right amount of kick. The fish and chips was pretty good, a little more breading than fish, but still tasty. I ordered the Pale Ale first, but got the Workingmans Mild by mistake. I'm not one to waste a beer, so I gave it a try. I wasn't a big fan of that one. However, the IPA was very good. Very flavorful and strong, but not overpowering. It's not cheap, but you get a decent amount of good quality food. I will definitely be back."
"For the past year I have lived and worked within walking distance of this restaurant, so I was a bit surprised that I had overlooked it in my first 9 or so months of eating out more or less every night. Granted, there are plenty of good options in the area ranging from the Rick Bayless restaurants to the Purple Pig, but that's still no excuse.The surprise was a pleasant one given that while the restaurant was not busy, the food was great! It got off to a good start with the complimentary bread and dipping sauce and was followed up with well-spice renditions of the classic dishes that I have at a million other Indian restaurants for better or worse. For a first visit, I tend to go for safer options - chicken korma, saag paneer are good candidates. If those are done well, then a follow-up vi"
"Fantastic playfull take on fine dining. The service was exceptional, but it really is all about the food. 8 course meal that left us trying to rate which dish was the more outstanding (dessert plate won, but the crab/scallop dish was a close second) They like to have fun with food, and we love to eat it!"
"Eh.I guess the whole ridiculously rude staff gimmick is amusing enough.If you're going to wait outside for 75 minutes like cattle, you might as well have some borderline-satire horrific people making the experience more of a worthy story. It was a bit odd when I dared order a dirty martini and the bartender laughed and said with a snark we don't DO olives."
Their food is great but the service is horrible. ��The staff walks around like they don't have a care in the world and act like they are not there to work. ��The best thing on their menu that I have had is the Cochinita Pibil. ��The pork is so tender and juicy.
Really enjoy this place!The beef w/ oyster sauce is particularly good (and mild for those complaining about the heat!)
one of my top 5 restaurants in Chicago.it's an all you can eat place with the most extensive salad bar I have ever seen and the tastiest meats. Wonderful wines from South America and nobody rushes you to leave.all is wonderfulEd
"OMGosh - This place is AMAZING, My Girlfriend took me there for a Birthday Celebration ( then to see Blue Man Group -which is right down the street) it is absolutely amazing, Please watch out for their Oreo and Andies Mint dessert - it's splendiferous."
"Really!?!? Best chicken in America by Yahoo? I mean, it was pretty good, but I guess a little overrated if you're saying BEST fried chicken. I tried the Seoul Sassy as well as the original. Their wings are HUGE which I liked, but my friend didn't. Smaller = juicier wings?? I don't agree. Anyway wings by themselves are definitely a 4 star rating. However, their Buddha bowl leaves a little to be desired. I know its a fusion type restaurant, but I suppose I'm just used to the kind in the stone bowls served hot with the rice all crispy on the edges! Also the service was meh. Overall, 3 star rating. If you like wings, go thy them here. They're good, but don't expect to be wowwwwed."
"I love this place, JB I think you couldn't see the difference between a Roll Royce and a Yugo !!!"
"One of the sad facts of my life is that I don't like Thai. My husband, on the other hand, loves it. So, what do we do? We eat at (or carry out from) Indie Cafe! And I absolutely adore their sushi.We've never had a meal there we didn't like (and we've had many). We like the atmosphere of the restaurant. Both of us has a some favorite dishes. Mine are gyoza, asparagus tempura maki, spicy tuna maki, and spicy sake maki. A perfect meal. Sigh. He loves the miso soup and the edamame, and has a few Thai dishes that are standards for him.Everything is always fresh. ��We're going to miss it when we move (next week).Not enough for me to lower my rating, though my husband might - apparently the gentleman who takes the phone orders has problems with communication.

"This is a really poor choice for brunch with friends. ��Like most places, they won't seat you before your entire party arrives. There's not really a good place to wait, but if there's space, you might be able to sit at the bar. ��The bigger problem is that, once you're a complete party, there really aren't any tables for groups over 4 (only a few of those) and once you've gotten a table, you'll still have to wait in line to order. ��They are SERIOUS about getting people out quickly, and have no patience for sitting around after you're finished eating. ��You tip when you order (even though there's no table service) so there's no consequence for rudeness while you eat. ��It's loud and tight, and not a great place to sit and chat. ��I went there with some friends recently and found it pretty unplea"
"The band that was playing was good, and that was about it.The bartender was a miserable old lady as my friend and I decided to order a bottle of wine, and she brought us an open bottle. When I complained to the manager AKA Chris the dick head (as I later called him) instead of apologizing for the bartender's stupidity he decided to join her in rudeness, ?asking me why I did not say something to her in the first place? My guess is that he was not smart enough to deal with such a gigantic issue. Next, we were also asked to be quiet! But obviously they say that to everybody just to feel important...?Last but not least, when we were ready to depart, I decided that I needed to let the manager Chris the dick head know how I felt about my evening's experience. So, I told him the place was great a"
"We had an absolutely delicious and fun meal celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. The wait staff was fantastic and the decor is classic for a steakhouse. We had the scallops for an appetizer (at the suggestion of our waiter)- some of the best I have every had. I had the big eye tuna special and my boyfriend had the Kansas City strip. The tuna was seared perfectly and he said his was the best steak he had ever had. They were complemented perfectly by lobster mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. ��For dessert, the waiter brought a chocolate pudding cake with a birthday candle and Happy Birthday written on the plate in chocolate. This was a completely memorable meal- I whole-heartedly recommend Mastro's to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion!"
go across the street - same money nicer people - Meli
Service is AMAZING food is FANTASTIC!!! Try the ceviche and the rasberry mojitos!! This place is AWESOME! Absolutely beautiful and be sure to check out the rooms in the dining area they have AMAZING art in the rooms!!
"This place has it all..... awesome beer list selection, unique drafts on tap, family friendly, nice decor, great prices!!! This is my new go to place for burgers and beer when guests in from out-of-town, I want to take my mom to lunch or just grab a late night burger and beer. Pretzel roll bun is a must, they cook the burger perfect, when you say rare, it is still rare and pink on the inside. Warm goat cheese great starter or the cheese curds! Burgers I suggest, the Texan with onion rings the size of your head on top of pulled pork and the burger in under there somewhere with the Texas toast!!! If they have the lamb meat burger (its a special usually) order that, melts in your mouth! This is a great place, try it out!!"
"After reading the reviews on Yelp, I was almost scared to make reservations too far in advance, so I started calling 2 weeks prior. Got a reservation without a problem, showed up, ate, and the food was awesome! No one called me to cancel, and the evening was great. I do have to say, though, that the whole cancelling last minute thing is very disturbing. You would think that a place this pricey would keep their customers happier... the anxiety alone from reading those sort of reviews is enough to make me say I probably won't go back. It's good to have tried it though!"
"I love Hot Doug's, but the wait is usually outrageous! ��They also close quite early... : ("
"The food here was great! I love Mexican food, and I have eaten at several different places, but I have found that this one is the best for authentic Mexican food. I have looked all over, each place has delicious food, but here it really tastes authentic! I love it! I can't wait to come back here again!"
"This review can not possibly add anything significant to the Yelp/Hopleaf discourse as everything great about this place(and everything really is fantastic) has been said. The superb food(you must try the Belgium style mussels!), splendid beer selection, timely service and friendly staff has all helped to ferment an unrelenting love in my heart for the Hopleaf. If only it was located in Logan Square...but its well worth the trip!"
"So just ate at Shaws as part of their 25 cent Oysters on Mondays. It is a great idea but the execution could be a lot better.Have you ever eaten at a restaurant that is under so much pressure that it reminds you of a scene from Apocalypse Now. The scene where there is this kid in a bunker trying to find out who his COO is. He doesn't know whats going on, and he is going to find out any time soon. Shaws was that kid in the bunker this afternoon.So I got to Shaws at 3:20 pm and the 25 cent oyster deal had only been offered for 20 minutes. the grill room was packed and it was obvious that the staff was under pressure. After a 15 minute wait I got a stool by the bar (really nice host got me a seat and I was able to get enough elbow room for myself). And then the waiting started..........I even"
The food was really great and the service was awesome as well. ��My friend had a birthday and they brought out an incredible dessert platter! ��Thanks Susan! ��She is the owner and her card is in the front of the resturant - can you believe it! ��Smart cookie!
"It seemed like a carnival was going on in my mouth from the extensive salad bar that was fantastic. The meats were extraordinary too. The dessert was marvelous. The servers and managers were extremely attentive. The best, by far, dining experience I have ever had. Can hardly wait for my next visit."
"Very good food, many varieties that are very tasty. ��Food was comparable to Brazzaz, enjoy the sides a bit more there. ��The service was quick and attentive."
HANDS DOWN THE BEST BREAKFAST IN THE CITY!!! Great fast service and very large portions for the low prices.
"Why are people complaining about service? ��You don't come to a place like this for service, you come for the food. ��You knew going into the experience you would have to wait so why post a complaint when you arrive and SURPRISE, there is a wait. ��You also don't come for the ambiance so why comment. I had-1. Chips w/Guac and Salsa- So so but didn't come for the chips/salsa.2. Ahodaga Torta- Golden pork carnitas, black beans, tomato broth, spicy arbol chile sauce, pickled onions. ��It was delicious, a must get. 3. Aztec Hot Chocolate- Very good. Best Hot Chocolate I have had, love the fresh chocolate made in house with the touch of chile/all spice. 4. Churros- nice touch to end the meal.Come for the food, leave your complaining at home. ��One of the waitresses will warn you of the wait when you"
"Good place, and very inexpensive for sushi. Nicely decorated and perfect for a first date. I would definitely recommend!"
Kid Unfriendly. They asked us to leave as our baby was being cranky. Don't ever go there will your young child.
"Ok, so I'll preface this by saying that I am NOT a vegetarian. ��I was kidnapped and taken to this strange place where people only eat green leafy things and the menu contains items that are listed as chicken to tease us meat eaters. ��Needless to say I was really impressed. The ONLY downside about this place is that it's tiny. ��If you don't mind possibly rubbing elbows to the person next to you then you shall be ok. ��The wait staff was greatThe food was good And they have a tiny parking lot located behind the restaurant. ��Oh and the cheesecake in phenomenal."
I love this place. High quality sushi.
Absolutely the best sandwich in town! Worth the wait....
"I don't know why it took me so long to discover this place, but it's wonderful! ��I've had catering to host several parties from Artopolis, and the guests are always impressed. ��Lately we've been going there for coffee and dessert late-night, or to grab a quick lunch. ��Every employee there is very kind as well. ��Some of my family's favorites include the spinach pie, the salads, and the yogurt mousse cakes from the pastry section."
good place... ��been there a bunch but have had great food but a slow server. ��over all I'll always go back even though its a little pricey
"Took a cab up to hopleaf on a suggestion from a coworker, being late sunday night we thought it would be a quite place to grab a beer and a late dinner. We were pleasantly surprised to see the place full of people when we found it. After finding a table in the bar we waited for service only to find we had to order both food and drinks from the bartender. The menu was was mix of quirky comfort food and pub-eats, I couldnt make my mind up, besides on the fact that I will come back to try everything I couldnt on the first trip."
"Can't say enough good about this place. Took a couple of friends from LA. We went at opening. ?We got there at 10am and at 10:20am a line began to form. After they opened the door, we ended up 5th in line. When we left 45 minutes later, there was a line around the corner and up the block. Absolutely amazing - the lines and the food. I don't like waiting in any line, but this place is worth it. Best encased meats I've ever had. Duck fat fries? Addictive. The is 1 problem with this place - it's hard to make up your mind what to eat. I wanted to try one of everything. When it gets warmer, I'll be back...and standing in line."
"Walking into Sprout, I immediately felt comforted. The vibe of the staff and ambiance in the room is very inviting. It felt particularly cozy on a rainy fall night. We started out with some specialty drinks that were recommended, a cider cocktail and a blueberry bourbon cocktail. All of my favorite things so my expectations were high, but the bartender absolutely delivered. We had to order a second. Our waiter was quite charming and enjoyable, and everyone that approached the table was polite and genuine. The chef's pre-meal taste was particularly delicious. I was happy to see a couple lamb offerings and tried the lamb chop appetizer, which was also excellent. I found the menu had a number of intriguing items; different twists to old favorites. I would have appreciated food source descript"
"Been going to Milk and Honey for 5-6 years. ��Continued giving it a chance, as it is 300 yards from where I live. ��Protocol has always been questionable. ��By the time I stand in line, order, pay, take a number, find a table, get my silverware, and get my water, I feel like I want to get in the kitchen and make some eggs. ��I The menu hasn't changed, nor the general attitude of the staff. ��Everyone there seems to resent the popularity the restaurant has enjoyed. ��Walked in for coffee on a recent Sunday at 7:58. ��Didn't realize that they weren't open yet (coffee shops are usually open at 8am on Sunday in the USA, yes?). ��I was greeted from the back of the restaurant with a ""Yeeeeeeeessss???"" ��The girl at the front counter didn't realize I was standing there. ��She promptly turned around and tol"
"It was great. The only thing that prevents it from being 5 stars is that I'd love to see a better selection for those with shellfish allergies. A few of the rolls sounded 95% great, except for they would add lobster or shrimp and that removed a number of options. Even still, I'll go back, but I'll keep pressing them to be more allergy-friendly (can we get our own deep fryer, at least?)"
"Thought we would watch the Super Bowl game here- had to RSVP on Chicago Social Network (CSN) site- REALLY You have to make a ��reservation for a Sports BAR?? Must be awesome, right? ��Got there early, found parking (didn't use valet-- omg, going too far now!) went in and gave my name. ��Of course, they couldn't find me (strike one,) andcall over the manager, who says the RSVP on the CSN was really for investors and ��their clients- WHAT? you mean you're not in busy for regular customers, just your investors and their clients???- bottom line they have no space (strike two.) Of course I make a fuss as its too late to go anywhere else, and I DID get a confirmation for my RSVP. ��All he can offer is two seats at the bar downstairs. Thanks! We thought we were golden (back to only one strike.) ��Noooo"
"Location is good, but you get a small place with its location. So, if you understand the space and go for the food...then you will enjoy yourself here. ?I always get the wings. Big and tasty. Try all types, I do. However my favorite is Seoul Sassy. Surprisingly some of the best wings in the city. Forget bars or wing places. ?This is where you get some of those great wings.The bowls are good too and there is plenty of food in them. I like the names, like Baby Buddha. This is a place to try and you will find yourself coming back for the wings. ?Just remember, since the wings are popular, sometimes they run out on weekends."
"Like it, not love it but good food!"
"Mmmmmmmmmmmm! Alinea was a gastronomical love story with a happy ending. By no means is it cheap but for the ultimate foodie experience, you have gotta try to this place. Presentation is amazing and everything just wows. ��I am definitely going to save up to eat here again."
"Kind of long line, but the food here was great. ��I was very pleased at the different menu choices and the price was reasonable. ��Would go back again"
Great food great service !! ��Even though price is high value is great for the tasty meats
Oh man due i love Garcia's! Ive bin coming here since 2001 since my boy Kevin brought me here for the first time.....this place rules......great Mexican food...prompt service...and the corona's are always ice cold....i was hanging out with my buddy Luke and we were trying to figure out what to eat and he threw out Mexican so i said Garcia's and to my surprise he had never bin there....i had the #1 Combination plate which included 1 Chile Relleno-2 Steak Enchilladas-Rice & Beans and a small salad for $9...it was fantastic....Luke had the Steak Torta with rice and beans which he loved...and again the beers were just freezing everytime a new one was brought...For 50 bucks total we both ate and drank like kings!
"If you're feeling for a korean bbq fix, this is a great place to get it at.Once you order everything comes out promptly and of course, cooks in front of you. Tons of tiny side dishes everywhere it also keeps me chewing yummy! The only complaint I have is that the kalbi was a bit bland of marinating. I'm pretty sure it was only that day because the second time I came back it was pretty good then. Typical pricing for korean bbq, great food, service was typical. I'll come back within the next few weeks when i'm craving for bbq again."
"ok... not a fan of the pizza crust... but... other food is good... when it doesn't have hairs in it... then... lets not forget that our waiter didnt get that you dont mention anything about ""catching cancer"" when the 10 people at the table are all wearing cancer walk t-shirts... ugh... what i wouldnt give for people to think before they speak...idiot."
"LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.The atmosphere is amazing. Bright colors, sky high ceilings, fun artwork...this place has it all. The raspberry mojitos are to die for, and the sangria is excellent-a little on the stronger side, which is how I like it. The food makes my mouth water just thinking about it, and I always leave feeling way too full because I HAVE to end the night with the churros!Service is always prompt and knowledgable. They offer great suggestions if you need help deciding on a menu item. Word of advice-ask to sit in the main dining room. So much more fun!"
Overrated....
"I did not know I would be paying $50 for food that sat out all day. How many people sneezed, coughed, and spread germs on the food before I ate it? I can tell you enough that I now sit here with the flu. I spent around $180 for my wife and I to eat. Next time we go out to dinner I will not dine where I have to serve myself off a buffet. If your looking to go out and try small portions of different food, I recommend one of the many tapas restaurants in town. You will pay less and have higher quality food."
"Although it wasn't officially opened yet...I had the pleasure of attending one of Sunda's advance tastings. ��The food, decor and service were all amazing and some of the best I have had in Chicago. ��The menu has a wide variety with a little something for everyone. ��From creative Asian appetizers to full dinners, sushi to Asian inspired cocktails, everything was tasty and exceeded my high expectations. ��I especially recommend the lemongrass beef lollipops, steamed bao buns, crispy shirmp toast with tuna jam and the Food Buddah's classic crispy rice with Kobe Beef or spicy tuna on top. ��A special shout out to the #10 sushi roll - I don't know what's in it but it was one of the best tasting things I've ever had.I'm sure this place will be crowded once it opens but it is well worth the wait!"
"I'm not a vegetarian, but I used to be, so when my vegetarian sister suggested we hit up The Chicago Diner for brunch yesterday I was a bit excited since she'd been telling me nothing but good things about the place since she moved downtown.We arrived as they opened and we were the only ones there.That being said I was a little disappointed in the service, they were prompt with the food, however 5 or 6 people, all employees, were lounging at the counter as we ate talking and joking (some of it rather crude, which is unprofessional to me but maybe I'm making too much out of it). That being said, the food was spectacular. ?We split the BBQ Wings which were out of this world. ?I never would have thought that meatless BBQ Wings would taste better than the real thing. ?I had the Biscuits and Gr"
"We went there over the weekend for a birthday celebration this past weekend and knew there would be trouble from the beginning. ��Called ahead of time to verify they would not be too busy was told when to come in. ��Got there 15 minutes prior to reservation. ��They were extremely busy. ��Got the last table. ��The pizza bread came on an ice cold plate. ��When we told one of the servers that a hot hor d'ourve should not be on an ice cold plate, he took the plate and we do not know where he went with it, but came back and placed the plate down in front of a person and did not say that the plate was extremely hot. ��The person picked up the plate and burned their fingers. ��Then the person whose birthday it was ordered the New York Strip steak. ��When the dinner came, they could not even pierce the ste"
"Save your money and time. ?We're fans of Top Chef, and as Rick Bayless won the first season of Top Chef Masters, when we were in Chicago we were excited to go to Frontera Grill.As others have mentioned, the wait can be interminable, and one wonders what the problem would be with taking reservations. ? Maybe its that they would not sell as many drinks if they didn't have the bar packed with people waiting an hour or more for the table. ?Well, it was a good margarita, but not a great one. ?Our local bartender makes a better one.But here's the worst part: ?the food was nothing special. ?It was OK, but it was NOT the exceptional. ?The pork I had was a bit dry. ?The black bean soup that they said to dip the pork in was good, but not spectacular. ?The tortillas were fine, but also not exceptiona"
"I have fallen in love with Sabatino's since day one. Everything is soooo good. Oysters Rockafeller are my fav and the Veal Boulinaise is where it's at. It's not on the menu, but if you enjoy a cheese/cream sauce and veal this is the dish for you. I look for excuses to go there, it's just done right from start to finish. Be prepared to sit and eat. Good food takes time and eating at Sabbey's is a process. Well worth every penny!"
This place is very nice..dimmed lights wit lit candles. The food is great and so is the price.BYOB!!!
All I can say is good. Super good.Enough to give five stars.
"Recently Simply It catered to my party. It was amazing!Ordering with the owner Tuan was very easy, I just told him what I wanted, the day I wanted it and got a total. A few days later, as promised the food came on time, fresh and ready to eat. All the finger foods like eggrolls, spring rolls, and salads were delicious.I also got a tray of beef and asparagus, and also had the sate shrimp made for us as well. With enough chicken fried rice to cover those two entrees. My guests loved it, I loved it and I definitely love Simply It."
"Try to hit Bongo on weekdays for lunch if your schedule allows. M-F there is never a wait for a table, yet the place stays busy, the energy level is still a good and having breakfast for lunch is always a good idea.People love the pancakes, but the omelets and sandwiches are also amazing!Wait staff is wonderful, many have been there for years, and they always remember you. Owners John and Derrick are always welcoming as well. If you are looking for something as a replacement for the sun during this cold, grey, endless winter, I suggest Bongo -- After this review, I'm heading over there!peace . love . goathttp://www.bucktown.org"
As good as it gets . ��Pizza tasted delicious and the ingredients were fresh and tasty. �� We had an excellent experience. ��remember to take a marker so you can be a part of the history by signing the walls. ��A must eat if you like thick styled pizza. ��A 5 rating in my book
I ate at Sunda with my family and thought the food was ok the place looks really nice and the service was ok I only went here from ��recommendations from friends
When I think pizza. I think Calo's. ��So delicious. ��They also have great Gnocchi and Fettucini Alfredo.
"Pros: Very affordable Italian BYOB that has lots of fans.Cons: Despite other reviews, I found the food marginal, and given the wealth of dining opportunities in Chicago, I cannot fathom the appeal. ��But taste is a matter of opinion, so here are some facts: the salads are not made to order, but instead are obviously pre-made (the ice cold dish and soggy/brownish lettuce remind one of a Holiday Inn wedding.) The pre-sliced bread tastes and feels day-old. The service is also hit/miss, as people in my party had their meal served cold. ��Further, since they only take reservations for large parties, and the restaurant lacks a bar, waiting parties are forced to congregate outside, or in the 4x4 vestibule. ��No fun during our long cold season.My advice: Affordable Italian is commonplace. Take a pass"
"Great decor, amazing food and amazing drinks! It's a place I will return to several times!!!"
Definitely like this place. ?One of my favorite places in Bucktown. ?This place has a great atmosphere and the pizza is good too. ?Not a bad place to be single either. ?I'll never forget the time I sang Band on the Run during a live Karaoke gig one night. ?Parking is a major challenge so grab a cab or take the Blue line if you can.
Very classy. Great beer choices. Excellent food. What more can I say!
"the worst restaurant this month. Its too expensive, compared to the the price, the taste isn't that great."
"The short of it: ?heavily garlic and salted tomato based sauces I would say are American Italian...not authentic to the least. ?Service was horrendous...which makes it worse since italian restaurants cater to not only the food, but the hospitality. ?Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen in the city, do not make the BYOB be the only reason you go there. ?Can't believe this place gets 4 stars. ?The long of it: My hubby and I were craving italian food and our usual spot was booked solid. ?So, we looked on yelp and saw that Caro Mio was well rated and that they make their own pasta...figured if they take the time to do that, it has to be good. We got there early-ish on a Saturday night at 6pm and walked int the door. ?We stood there for over 5 mins while the head of the house stood on against"
I love this place! The food is great! Try the chorizo con queso or Al Pastor on top of the nachos! The manager Elias is a nice man. CHEAP!
"i'm a fan, ��i just wish they still did wholesale delivery, we order'd alot of stuff for dollop coffee co and then they just stop'd doing it, tasty treats affordable, looking for a replacement that delivers.. anyone?"
"The food is great. I never thought I would like a savory crepe, but this place turned me around. I also really like the turkish cofee and the fruit bowls are always delish. I admit the service can be a bit slow, but that is pretty typical of a true Cafe' experience where you come to catch up with friends and family. I also really enjoy the atmosphere. I always feel like I am being transported to another country. Bottom Line: Great food, Great Price"
"Great place to hear old (and new) school jazz. Points given for excellent atmosphere, great music and a decent beer selection. Points deducted for a sometimes snooty staff and certain clientele who seem to feel above the place itself. Often the crowd can feel touristy. Show up early enough (8:00 when the set starts at 9:00) or you'll be standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the socialites. A great place...I just wish it were a bit less known to the trend-seekers."
"JUST GROSS! 2 of us went on 7/10/11 and lunch was $50.00 the pork was overcooked and dry, then covered with a small jar of garlic and oil to make it seem moist. Best part of lunch was the water, the sun, Henry the waiter, the drunk lady behind me for her birthday and my date Tim!I will never return to this 90 miles to Cuba, it is under new management and even though they wanted me to try something else or give me a free dessert i took neither, I would have desired them to remove it from my bill. I only took two bites and ouch!one word ""don't"""
Went there on my birthday and had a blast. ��They have half off margarita pitchers on Tuesdays which just hapen to be my birthday night. ��I got wasted and ended up partying with one of the waitresses after she got off work. ��It was a blast. ��Besides that though the atmosphere is wonderful with an authentic Mexican feel. ��This place also has a porch in the back which is nicely decorated as well.
"MI was excited to go here because I had heard great things about the lobster so we went hoping that it was a place to have a nice dinner . We had called ahead to see if they could fit us in and they said they had plenty of seating and she would put our names on their list , when we got there person in the front said our names were not on the list and gave my husband a dirty look. He said to follow him and he lead us towards the back of the restaurant and then he said it was a short cut he took us though the back kitchen and server area , there was plenty of free tables. But he left us next to the waiters serving area and sat us next to the kitchen and serving area I was upset that there was so much space and the person sitting us decided that was a good place to sit us my husband is a prof"
Great beer list.Really yummy menu.Lot's of beer geeks working there - fun!Staff was kind of rude (which is why I left off one star!)
great foodlong linesworth the waitwow
I loved this cozy restaurant!!! We started out with the Francesca Salad which was delicious! ��My friends are not shy about sharing so I can attest that ALL of the dinners were great. I'll be back as it's some of the best Italian food that I've had since moving to the city.
Best pizza in the city! I wish I lived in their delivery range still....
"I dont understand why some restaurants feel the need to play their music so loud that its hard to have a conversation. ��Really-- why? ��Its just not necessary. �� The food was ok, service inconsistent (from door to wait staff to bar), decor is beautiful, but the chairs are a bit uncomfortable. ��I really want to give Big Jones another chance. ��I've heard very mixed things, and so many experiences better than my own-- but, please- Turn Down The Music!!!!!"
"my cousin and i stumbled across f&o while on the way to riva for dinner. it was closed for the night but we decided to come back for breakfast the next morning. i had the pancakes-the BEST i've ever had! i've brought my daughter in here a couple of times (we live in the super-boonies). food is yummy and the grocery store has very interesting items! yes, it's pricey-but it's a interesting place to check out."
"""Eh""... explains it all. The food is nothing special and the price is ridiculous."
"We decided to try this place because of the name. But we'll go back to this place because of the beer list, friendly service, and the amazing and unique burgers -- and I'm a vegetarian! The decor is kinda Snow White meets tormented art student. Our server was very helpful in narrowing down the overwhelming selection of beers (which also could be chosen on interesting names alone ... ie the cereal killer).This place is known for their burgers, but I'm a vegetarian and even I walked away smiling! They're veggie burger can be substituted in any of the burgers on the menu -- I certainly didn't want to miss out on a burger topped w/corn salsa and avocado. The veggie burger is made out of chickpeas and yummy spices, with the consistency kind of like a falafel. Delish, is really all you need to k"
"We were blown away! Unique spin on pork dishes, and what we tasted was incredible. ��We had beets with goat cheese (a must), pigs ear (sounds weirder than it tasted... delicious), and pork shoulder with mashed (the best of the three). If there's a wait, just eat at the bar. Worth a visit, for sure!"
"I loved (past tense) this place. ��Not now. ��The breakfast berries were old and wrinkled. ��The stuffed french toast tasted like bad fruit cheese compote. ��And when we - I took a visiting friend from DC - spoke to the owner, he was rude and not at all the professional his mother Nana is. ��I'm looking for soomething else. ��You should too."
"I personally feel that when someone goes on a TV show with synapse cooking, they should not feel entitled to open up a restaurant. The service was HORRIBLE. There is no coat check, so my giant poofy coat was trapped between my chair and the chair that was resting against it. We were basically sitting in the fucking walkway. The decor looked like someone spent $40 at a Pier One outlet mall. Right as we sat doesn't at 8, I ordered a vodka tonic..... It arrived at 8:20. The waitress was so busy, that she actually only came over twice during the whole meal. Now the menu- ahhhhhh. It's one thing to Be complex, but this guy obviously felt he needed to make the dishes complicated to seem gourmet. Farro risotto with RAW celery root, duck(which was the only edible thing) and cherries? See, if any o"
"I joined Yelp just so I could add some information to all the fabulous reviews about Alinea. ��The food, wine, and service are as good as everyone says - there's not even a question about that. ��Here's some info that I was looking for before I went but had trouble finding:Atmosphere - Very cool. ��Good noise level, fancy but not too fancy. ��Dress code for men - jacket required, no tie necessary.Dress code for ladies - cocktail dress or dressy business clothes, but you don't have to go all out.Price - $200+ for the dinner, wine pairings are $150 or $300Are the wine parings worth it? - YES! ��But plenty of people were ordering bottles.How much wine is it? - 10 tastes, equal to four glasses total. ��They top you off occasionally for bonus wine.Food allergies? - They happily accommodate them in su"
This is one of my favorite Italian Restaurants. ?It has a great old school atmosphere and classic menu. ?The food is really good and they give you a basket of delicious pizza bread when you arrive. ?Easy to get to and free parking (I always tip the guy).
"Okay, I'll start with saying that I'm a cocktail snob, appetizer fiend and and desperately crave originality. ��That said, The Violet Hour has become one of my favorite places in this City.They had me at the lack of front window (or any other sign of existence beyond a single light bulb and knowledge that it was there before hand. I won't go over every detail about this spot (got to see for yourself) however, I will say... GET the fried peanut butter and banana sandwich and anything with gin in it. ��Oh yeah Absinthe. The real way man.GO!"
"Had a great lunch here today! ��The tomato soup was excellent and my avocado sandwich was fresh and delicious. ��The place was bustling and we had a really nice time.Good value, homemade treats, and a nice feeling place!"
"How can you go wrong at place who's slogan is Cheese, Swine & Wine?...and it's boldly erected in metal on the front gate as you walk through the entrance! ?My wife and I chose The Purple Pig for our date night a coupe weeks ago because it was newer place we had never been to and not to mention that it is backed by some Chicago heavy hitter chef's from Spiaggia, Heaven on Seven & Mia Francesca (all places we love).We happened to be staying downtown so we were able to walk to the PP as it is located basically on Michigan Ave..we had no reservations, we were just talking our time because we were in no hurry. ?The patio, right outside the front door, was hopping.Fate was on our side because we got two seats at the bar, which is where we wanted to be. ?The bartender (who basically serves drinks"
Love the great pizza and the new brews. ��The Disfunctionale was my favorite!
I love this place! ?It's like going to South America without having to pack and find your passport. ?The food is great. ?The atmosphere is energetic. ?The drinks are strong. ?My friends and I frequent this place at least once or twice a month.
"Not worth the one star! Dreadful service, really bad staff. Average food. Now understand why it's half empty at 8pm on Saturday night."
Great pizza!
"Id glady pay 10$ for their pancakes, have you seen them? this place blows orange out of the water. the wait is long but you can window shop up and down the street, and have a cup of joe. I ��really like the place, they get in in and out."
This amazing restaurant is my new favorite place to eat. ��The food is absolutely delicious and the people are so friendly you want to just keep coming back for more and more. ��The owner is a gem too so so and support this amazing local restaurant- which happens to be 100% authentic.
Nice place for a sandwich and coffee. It can have a long line and not many seats.
"Having eaten at Michelin 3-Star restaurants all over the world, I can easily say that Alinea leaves all the others in its dust. ��It was worth every penny not only for the exquisite and unique food, but for the entertainment value. ��Where else can you go for a meal and never eat off of anything that looks remotely like a plate -- and where every item that is used to hold or contain each morsel of food is something you've never seen before? ��Where else can you go where you feel like you've died and gone to Heaven after every bite? ��The word inventive is wholly inadequate to convey how off-the-charts the food is. ��I spent the entire meal with my jaw on the floor, so to speak, and was utterly depressed when the meal was over and we had to leave. ��Save your shekels, and then run, do not walk, t"
"Simply It is Simply excellent! ��Great, authentic, Vietnamese cuisine, at very fair prices. ��This is my 'goto' place for Pho and Spicy Beef Salad. ��The people that work there are extremely friendly, and the owner is usually there to welcome us with a smile. ��A big two thumbs up to Simply It!"
"Great hot dogs and selection, Very nice owner and staff as well."
My first review and my first five star rating. This is the place to get the best food in chicago. Cast aside any reservations and try it today.
"This is one of my favorite restaurants EVER! I make a point to visit every time I am in Chicago. ��The food is out of this world. Great ambience, excellent service, and a fantastic menu! ��Try to get seated upstairs and don't spare any expense- the soups, appetizers, entrees, drinks and desserts are all pricey, but sooooo worth it."
"Great little neighborhood Italian restaurant. ��The service is a little slow, but if you're looking for a great place for a romantic dinner or for a group of friends, then part of the fun is lingering over the meal. ��Huge portions of great tasting food and you can't miss with BYOB."
Love this pizza. I'm a fan of the pan. SO GOOD. Decent ranch too.
"This place has that elusive independent coffee house feel, but with some rather tasty food to go with it. I love going there for breakfast. Try their orange brioche french toast, or the pancakes du jour. Just try to get there early... they get packed VERY quickly."
"Simply It is simply it for the best Vietnamese food in Chicago. ��Their Saigonese crepe is to die for. ��Magnifico pho. ��Clay pot chicken, lemongrass anything. ��Open Mondays now. ��Great Tues/Weds deals.Easy to miss amidst Lincoln Avenue bars. ��Don't!Chuck"
"I used to live close to this restaurant, so I've been here quite a few times. ��I always had the Coconut and Mango Beef, which was amazing (and fun- its served in a coconut bowl). ��Wish I still lived in Chicago so I could go back."
"Move over Lou Magnattis, Gino's East, Giardanos, and any other great pizza place you can think of. ��If you think you've had the best pizza than you haven't been to The Art of Pizza! ��This place although not fancy but what pizza place is is an absolute amazing place. ��The taste of there pizza cannot compare to any I have been to before. ��I wish there were more The Art of Pizza in and around the Chicagoland area. ��Whether your looking to sit down and eat or on the go this place is ready to serve your needs. ��My business partners and I have had a couple of our meetings there just so we can have a pizza. ��I always get the deep dish and it is delish. ��Pricing is very affordable and a bang for your buck~"
"We were here on on Sunday, it was an amazing experience. The service, food and atmosphere were superb. Great place for families or even a date night. We will definitely be back."
"Came here last night and had the Aruchetta (pork chops). ��Fantastic. ��I love the decor of the place and everything was presented fantastically. ��Our server was very friendly and I loved the margarita I ordered. ��I was not a particular fan of the coconut mojito, but that could just be me.Overall, a great place. ��A bit pricey but you're getting quality food. ��Will be back!"
It is super fun here!!! ��I will be back soon. ��The food was good and the service was better.
"This is my FAVORITE Italian restaurant in Chicago. The ambiance is so charming, with exposed brick, sparkling lights and small rooms. The pasta is all homemade and the sauces are delicious, but it also has great seafood offerings. I love th e salmon! I dream about the tiramisu, because it is so tasty and such a generous portion. They have a great wine menu, overflowing bread bowls, and a charming head chef who will send you generous monthly coupons and birthday coupons once you get on his mailing list. This is the first place my husband and I take people when they visit, and it our birthday tradition to go to this neighborhood gem."
"If you want to impress a date, or even a spouse, try this place. great quality, well prepared, and served superbly. Not to mention a kick ass salad bar. One problem with some brazilian places, is that the different meats seem to taste the same after a while. Not here. each cut had its own marvelous and distinct, (and truly tasty) flavor. All in all, this is a great place to experience some beautifully prepared and served meals. Definitely a place to come back to."
This place is so good. I would go here everyday if I had the self control not to devour everything in site.
"This is a great place for Roast Duck/Peking Duck 3 Ways. I call for a reservation, specify the duck, and it's always been there. Only Duck Chang's in Annandale, Va beats Sun Wah, and Sun Wah beats every other Roast Duck I've had in SF, NYC, DC area, and Toronto. (I just wish they did 4 Ways.)Sun Wah's approach is a bit different - they serve buns instead of pancakes, and the vegie dish is fried rice with duck. The soup could be richer. OTOH, they get more meat from the duck than other places.They still haven't got the service part down pat, but they seem to be improving, but the duck makes any glitches worth the wait. Don't go for an elegant meal - go when you want good food."
John and I have been here at least five times in the past year or so now and it's great every time. It's wonderful just the two of us to have a nice long delicious meal. But it's also a good place for a special dinner with friends. If you go early in the evening you can get a booth (which is much nicer than the tables) without a reservation. ��Otherwise definitely call ahead. The service is always top notch when we've been here.Once things pick up there is a live Spanish guitar performance up front (which you can hear through out the restaurant). That always sets the mood for a relaxing night out.The food and wine list are always great as well. I won't stop recommending Gejas!
"This use to be the best place for authentic mexican food. Unfortunately, after remodeling the food does not taste the same. I use to go weekly, now I only go rarely."
"This is the best AUTHENTIC Mexican Restaurant in the city.....hands down. ��If you are use to chain types like Chi-Chi or Pepe's Tacos...this is not for you. ��If you want to experience the TRADITIONAL and homemade foods try the guisados and tacos for starters...they are flavorful and authentically spiced and garnished. My family and friends have been coming here since the early 1970's and the food is still excellent and the service is average. At times, you get a small complementary taster plate of what they are cooking that day. The chips and salsas are good, the bathrooms need an upgrade and the quarry floors can get slippery when its crowed. ��They take CASH ONLY but its cheap and fast and you can BYOB! ��Loaded with locals and students...still the best in Chi-Town."
Good food
"Definitely overpriced. $12 for macaroni and cheese and cole slaw? That didn't even taste outstanding? The menu did not have a lot of choice. ��The wait staff was annoyingly absent most of the time, forgetting several requests. ��The food was basically just ok. Not worth the money or effort."
Friendly staffBone marrow forget about itMussels not worth itChicken goodThe restaurant run out of coffee Loud music
"We are originally from Boston. I took my boyfriend here for our 2 year anniversary and it was in one word FABULOUS!Our waiter (I think his name was Fred?... sorry been a while) was awesome! The food was to die for and our waiter was very helpful in helping us pick out different Tapas to try.The portions are small but with Tapas you shouldn't expect to busting at the gut.When we told the waiter that it was our anniversary, he brought out a complimentary assortment of their desserts.My boyfriend tried Rabbit for the first time and it was one of the best things we have ever eaten. By the way the dishes are presented you can tell that someone has taken alot of time and care on presentation and on taste!The decor was gorgeous and the website pictures does not do this place any justice.I would h"
"It was my first time here for a birthday party with 13 friends. I would have to say it was definitely a surprise to me how great this place was. I never thought to venture because I'm not usually into chain restaurants. I ordered the filet and actually enjoyed the sizzling butter on the plate. At first I thought it would be a little to greasy, but by the middle of the steak I was dunking every piece I cut off into it. (surprised myself) The sides were ok, could have been a little better for my taste. (tried a bunch of them, since there were so many of us). They had a decent wine selection and I enjoyed that as well. The desserts were definitely worth getting and I won't be such a stranger to this restaurant even though i had my doubts originally"
"We have been to Geja's several times and it is always a wonderful time. ��The food is excellent, the service the same. ��The entire staff is helpful in explaining the menu items and how to cook each of the courses. ��The waitstaff makes sure you have everything you need without making you feel rushed. ��Drinks are replenished as needed without having to look for staff. ��It is a wonderful place to celebrate a special occasion, or just enjoy a dinner with friends or family. ��Because it is a small restaurant, I would recommend going early (we had reservations for 5:30). ��We were seated promptly and the restaurant was relatively quiet."
"Huge portions, lots of old world charm. A great place for Italian food at reasonable prices."
"Gino's East has joined the ranks of other big name deep dish pizzerias. ��They no longer are deep dish, they are just a thick crust pizza. ��Including their frozen pizza. ��More dough and sauce. less cheese and meat. ��It will be a sad day when Chicago loses its deep dish title, because these pizzerias are cutting corners due to the economy. ��These big pizzerias will lose loyal customers. �� I'm sure they will gain customers who never really had a deep dish."
This place was nice and cozy The chairs were hard to get comfortable I liked the melting pot.
"My first visit to this restaurant was OK. ��Our server was very nice and offered a few specials, but the food for person in our came out about five minutes later than the rest and one appetizer never came at all. ��Given this is a neighborhood place and BYO, I am willing to look past this point. ��The food is very average, I challenge someone to point out a dish at this restaurant that is done better than at any other Italian Restaurant in the city save Buca di Beppo. ��Went back...err...tried to go back for seconds last night and have never been treated so poorly in my life. ��Our entire party was not there and the host made it a point that we needed all people there to be seated (OK) and informed us that at 6:15 that our reservation would be lost. ��Mind you the restaurant is half-empty at thi"
"Order here every weekend, sometimes twice a week. The lasagnia is tha bomb....as is the pizza, ask for a menu for the cupons....the biggest thin crust w/ cupon is the best deal!"
"OH MY GAWD! This is like a carnivore's heaven! And that SUCKS for me, because I can't eat red meat :( At first I thought, ""well, this is gonna suck, paying almost $50 and I can't eat sh#$??""Well, I was SOOOOO wrong! When I first walked in, I saw those succulent raw oysters calling my name from the salad bar, along with the most amazing mushroom risotto and different variety of salads and sushi. Well, I didn't pay $50 just to eat at a salad bar, right? The waiters swirl around as if they are in a ballroom, holding huge racks of meat. For non red meat eaters like me, there are still much to choose from. From the Parmesan crusted pork chops, roasted chicken and freshwater shrimp, to the always oh so amazing grilled pineapples. Let's just say, I walked out as a happy girl :)"
"Stay away, has rats in the kitchen, too much MSGServices are terrible, they just want your tipsAfter eat over here, ��i am sure that your whole body will smell so so so stink !!! Many other 'Pho' places around this area have better qualities at the same costs."
"By far the best deep dish, stuffed pizza in the city!! ��I have not even ordered anything else because their pizza is so delicious! ��They do offer great day to day specials and awesome prices. ��The sauce on their pizza is unlike any other, they don't over do it with the grease and cheese like Gino's or Giodanios. ��They use just enough cheese and a good amount of crust. ��I love their pizza so much I always order more than I can eat in order to have left overs! ��I suggest making sure to have left overs and pop a slice in the toaster oven for lunch the next day!"
Absolutely amazing. ��I had the Epanandas and the whole red snapper. ��I sat on their outside seating area and sipped a refreshing limey drink that mad the hot day seem to melt away! ��Love it and highly recommend it.
"Expensive food, but really good. Sit outside if you can, since the outside seating is an amazing spot for people watching. Just remember that they are probably watching you back!I would go back."
"Food was average and the service was fine but the bar itself is nothing that a Chicago bar should be. Way over the top corny atmosphere with a weird prison theme. People who actually enjoy hard rock don't need a ""theme"". So many bars in this area. Choose one that's a little more authentic."
"5 Stars, BUT - I come here for one thing and one thing only - the Pho with Beef, Brisket and Tripe. ��And man is that delicious. ��Service is usually fast and friendly with lapses only when they are jammed, so I totally get it.I've been here with family and friends and have gotten a variety of foods here and everyone has always liked everything, even the vegetarians! : )"
"Great pizza...just brutal service. ��After some bad experiences in the last few months--bad charges on CC, order not being correct, no record of order--might be time to go our separate ways."
"I wish I could give five stars, because the food is really delicious! ��Always well-seasoned (I think they use crack cocaine on the chips though, because I always get hooked after the first one!) and lovingly prepared. But today, I opted to not get water (or any drink) because I picked up 2 glasses from the stacks (water is self-service) that were FILTHY! ��How disappointed was I today?? ��I love XOCO, but they need a new dishwasher."
been eatin here 4 ever i'll never stop loving this place
"This was the best brunch I've ever had, flat out. ��I was taken there as a gift, and it truly was one. ��The waiter was terrific. ��The food was amazing. ��The art on the walls was a wonderful addition to the experience."
"Please please open a place closer to Skokie or deliver out here, it sucks that I no longer work across the stress...those sassy wings remind me of some wings I had in Portland from a place called Pok Pok, a thai street food concept..which means some of the best wings I have ever had, damn crack wings..."
"I suggested to my friend to meet me at the Devon restaurant due to its location. ��I had fond memories of Uncommon Ground in the past: good mac and cheese and a very comfy bar. ��My experience yesterday was bad, however.I asked for a rose' wine. ��I was given a choice between a sparkling rose' or a bottle. ��Not wanting a bottle for myself, I ordered the sparkling. ��My fault for not asking the price first...$12.00 per glass.My dining friend showed up and ordered the $5.00 Mimosa special, listed on the chalk sign at the front door. ��She was told by the bar staff that it was a mistake - the cost was $6.00. ��If so, it is easy to change a chalk price to the correct price. ��As it turned out, the bar staff was wrong - the correct price was $5.00.At the dining table, our waitress was very nice. ��At o"
"This restaurant is an old favorite and I'm happy to say it is just as wonderful as ever. Our server was knowledgable, pleasant, accomodating, and timely- really good at her job. Our food was absolutely delicous from the appetizers to the entrees. Although the restaurant was packed we never felt crowded or rushed. The sugarcane-speared shrimp lettuce wrap was fresh and flavorful, the skate appetizer was savory and rich. The whole, crispy, sweet and sour snapper took the prize- I highly recommend this dish. We also enjoyed the spicy grilled shrimp entree- just hot enough and juicy and tender. The entire evening was delightful and the perfect romantic experience for me and my date."
"back to gilt bar this weekend. ��You better reserve ahead especially for weekends. ��I waited for a table for over an hour but eventually grabbed a seat at the bar.food,Peach salad = amazing! wasn't sure what to expect with the combination of peaches and manchego but it worked beautifulHamachi crudo = light clean and refreshingPork meatballs = just ridiculous! you gotta try them.and la chouffe on draft is a must"
The food is great at Calo's. ��I do have a problem with their packaging. ��Every item of food is at least double wrapped. ��Not only in containers but aluminum foil ��and paper as well. ��In a time where it is clearly apparent that waste and over consumption is leading to global problems it seems absurd that they are almost flaunting waste with their packaging..They would get 4 stars if they had greener practices.
We were able to bring our own bottle of champagne and make mimosas. ��We mixed it with the strawberry orange juice; it was delicious! ��I ordered the cinnamon roll french toast and it was unbelievable! ��The french toast came with frosting that you were able to spread over each piece. ��I cannot wait to go back there again!
Now let me establish that I love my hot pot!I studied abroad in Beijing for over a year and tried multiple hot post establishments and loved every single location that I had ever been to.When I showed up to Lao Sze Chuan the waitress was quite unfriendly (which I was accustomed to in Beijing but not USA) and she Immediately took note that I was not Chinese so when I said I wanted hot pot she said OK you want buffet and just walked away. ��I had to go get her and tell her I wanted to pick the items myself.Once the hot pot arrived i was thoroughly excited but the hot pot which I asked to be spicy was not even near spicy....It also lacked the tongue numbing flower pepper that every hot pot place I had ever been to had in the broth. ��The pig stomach and intestine were not the Chinese style I wa
"You are so right Lauren. ��The owner is a total jerk. We had been at our table for about 30 minutes, when the jerk owner came by and told us he needed our table. What!! ��We were going to order dessert and coffee but we decided to pass. ��We lingered over our water for the next 15 minutes, while the owner fumed. ��We will not return."
The food is so good and the key is to get there just before the stores close. If you need to wait the bar is open. The molton Chocolate cake is worth the wait.
Awesome! Best traditional greek food!
"Low-priced and delicious. ��I am always full for 10 bucks or less. ��The spicey fallafel and lentil soup are my standards, sometimes I throw in a cheese and egg pie."
"From making our reservation to paying the check, this place is amazing! The staff is wonderful, cheery and hard working. The decor is so welcoming and warm. The food is delicious AND great for you. My Vegetarian sister-in-law and I went with my 3 picky young children and all of us loved our food! I live an hour and a half away and cannot wait to get back here!"
Wow...This place is super sensual and bring out conversations for adults.Great wine selection and very educated staff.The fondue is well executed and the service is attentive.I would come back next anniversary.
The food and service is always terrific. ��Wildfire is great for their consistency with good and guest service. ��Never disappointed.
"One word: ROMANTIC. The entire atmosphere is set up for a great intimate evening. The three courses will completely stuff you, and it's something that is a little different. Not every restaraunt you basically cook your own fooe. The Fondue itself is just fun! The add some wine, mood lighting, and cozy corners and you get again-ROMANTIC. Perfect for dates or a sweet night out!"
"Great service, great food - had a wonderful night at Ruth Chris"
"I can't tell you how much I enjoy this place...but I will certainly try! This is my go to burger bar and I love introducing it to my friends. Everything I've had there has been stellar. The Veggie burger is especially something of note; not too dry but packed full of flavor. If you are really in the mood to indulge, try the belly burger; a burger, topped with crispy pork belly and horseradish mayo! Service has always been great and the beer/wine list is extensive."
"Shockingly, stunningly good. ��Each course was refreshingly unique, and exceedingly successful. ��I'm one-hundred-percent positive that I want to eat Jellyfish pad thai for the rest of my lunches from now until eternity. ��My girlfriend and I went to celebrate her birthday and my recent move to Chicago. ��I work in the restaurant business and we go out quite often. ��Because of that we both are averse to putting out fellow restaurant workers, and so try to be as low maintenance as possible. ��That being said, we have food restrictions (i.e. allergies, vegetarianism) though we try to get dishes already on menus rather than trying to get special meals. �� We didn't have to worry about that at Schwa. ��Executive-chef Michael Carlson personally tailored a 10 course meal for each of us. ��Mostly it was "
"This place is great for encased meats/sausages/whatever.. The line's a little bit ridiculous and I won't go as far as to say that this place is overrated, but waiting an hour for sausage and luke-warm fries didn't exactly live up to my expectations when standing outside for an hour on my bday. I'd still go back, no doubt about it, I'm just saying, the line's a bit much.."
"just ok! ��decorated great! warm cozy feel! food was not outstanding, it was just ok. ��nothing to brag about. prices are a little steep. ��i would think this is a great place to catch a game and if the place is packed and all cheering for the same team its probably a lot of fun. the place draws you in because it looks so good from the outside you just want to try it."
"After one visit, I am ADDICTED!!! My boss told me about Simply It and that she wanted to use them to cater a huge meeting coming up. I NOW KNOW WHY!!! The food was out of this world, the service was outstanding, and the entire experience left me grinning from ear to ear for at least an hour after eating. (I'm not kidding!) You will leave with your stomach and wallet full because Simply It is beyond reasonable for the quality and portions of food and it's darn tasty. ��What more could you ask for for a family owned, authentic restaurant? Well done, Simply It!!"
"I love this place! Im a big eater,and the steak burritto fills me up! The steak is the best.Big ol' Burritto! The service is great,and so is the food.Not too expensive.The steak burritto is only like 7 bucks.And it's huge! Check it out!"
"A particular foreign songs starts playing in my head whenever I think about this restaurant. The song isn't important, but the experience is. You may think by the time you take your first step into the place that you're under-dressed, but that might have been just me and my significant other. That all changed the moment they greeted us. Such open, generous, genuine smiles will make you feel really welcome. once you're seated and they start serving your meal, you'd start thinking things are over priced, but as they keep on serving such delicacies on and on, you start to realize the amount of food that your going through. Imagine a table filled with delicious hors d'oeuvres, layer upon layer (in ��a neat way), all hidden away. Something like that. This is definitely the place for a romantic f"
"Great BYOB sushi place, quality sushi and the miso soup is great too. ��I always get a version of the Dragon roll at every Japanese place i go to, and i still haven't been able to match the one at Friends Sushi in the Gold Coast. ��I have moved out of the Gold Coast about a year ago and still trying to find my roll. ��The sushi is good quality here and the BYOB can't be beat, definitely worth a check out."
"If your intention is eating 30-40 oz of meat in 1 sitting Fogo is the place to go....Otherwise steer clear. ��While I've not been to many other Brazilian steakhouses I am quite sure Fogo de Chao is among the best. ��However, I feel this concept is nothing but a worn out gimmick.I was totally unimpressed with the over salted and bitterly smokey meat. ��It is nonsense to take what is undoubtedly prime meat and smother it in sea salt and then cook it over smoke. ��If I wanted cured and then smoked taste I would buy some Ekrich smoked sausage for $2.99 at Jewel.The other major flaw I see in this operation is the piercing and subsequent carving of hot meat. ��If the intention is to create shoe leather consistency then mission accomplished. �� The service was outstanding and the atmosphere was pleasan"
I loved the food!!!..The service and quality are awesome!!!
"I go to the Oyster bar about once a week with my boyfriend. Obviouslyif we go every week we LOVE this place. They know our names and I feel like family whenever I walk in. Needless to say the food is fantastic. I have yet to order something and be disappointed. Oh, and the oyster shooters are top notch. Be careful though, they are powerful and deliver quite the kick.Yummm"
"Although it is a splurge (in Mexican food terms) to eat here, I most definitely plan on returning. ��Mexican is my favorite food, and this place is the best. ��The food was fresh, delicious, and the service was great. *Really glad I made reservations-it gets busy!*"
"This pizza is ok. ?It's not the best, but when you can get a Lou Malnati's deep dish for 10 bucks that's twice as filling, why go here? ?Oh, that's right...the bar. ?They have a bar and if you happen to walk in, you might get run over by a stampede of smoking 20 somethings hanging out on the corner or getting out of cars. ?Overall, apart from the price, this pizza isn't too bad, I just think it's overpriced. ?The pizza place next door that features new york style pizza offers more for the money (though that place is expensive as well, but the new york style pizza is authentic). ?Piece's claim to fame is that it's a Connecticut style pizza from New Haven, I think. ?So if you've ever wondered what east coast pizza is like, you have two options almost right next to each other. ?If you're not "
"Went to Little Bucharest tonight for dinner. ��Parking was easy and convenient. ��Had appetizers of saganagi and eggplant spread. ��Saganagi was great and eggplant okay. ��The dinner of short ribs goulash left alot to be desired. ��Had apple strudel for dessert and how ccould apple streudel be flat and tasteless?Drinks were good, but VERY small portions - not worth the money. ��I will not go back. THere is absolutely no light fare on the menu. ��It would have been nice to see a dinner salad instead of very heavy food."
so delicious!
Best food outside of Paris. ��Et aucune attitude.
"I would recommend this restaurant whole-heartedly!It's small, quaint, and charming. The food is excellent. I have eaten here on the first year that it opened and the menu changed through the years. I like friendly chef who greeted us at the table (a very nice personal touch). Reservations a must. The restaurant is small so it is impossible to get a table during weekends. Sign up for their mailing list for their special events."
I love this place BBQ chicken. If i could live off this food i would lol. Their rice dish/ egg noodle dish. are extremly �� cheap ��$5-6
Like the steak tacos. Margaritas are good too. A good meal every time I've been there.
Good Pizza. ��Poor Service. ��Ordered a slice for dinner and a salad to start thinking there would be a wait for the pizza. ��Unfortunately after the expected wait they came out together. ��No drink refill. ��No concern for the untouched salad when she finally came around to clear. ��It took two trips to the bar to work out my bill. ��Frustrating.
"I'll make this a quick review, because there are so many already.I give Giordano's 5-stars because it is always good, always what I ordered, and always within the time-frame of the order (if delivery). ��Eating in is always great, as the atmosphere is fun, Italian-ish, has a bar, personable waiters/waitresses, and just all-around a good time to be had.The food is spectacular. ��It is the best deep-dish (or otherwise) pizza I have had in this city so far. ��I have had Giordano's, Connies, Uno's, etc, and Giordano's wins hands down by far. ��It is even great delivered, if not better. ��I had Giordano's, in fact, twice this week with friends from out of town, and the better of the two (if I can even compare them) was the delivered pizza, I think. ��It may have had to do with the temperature of the "
Some of the best fajitas in town! Cheap and one plate of food is more than enough to feed two people. Love the little appetizers they give for free. Sauces galore
"Not too sure I will be stopping Wilde any time soon. While the place looks great, there's not too much to offer as far as good food. The server was somewhat attentive, but seemed to dissapear after she dropped the bill. The place still has some work to do."
"OMG! This place was horrible. It's really loud, not just the customer but the owner as well. He was yelling and embarrassing his staff in front of customers. I felt sorry when I saw that. I know the food was great, but me seeing that was not acceptable. I hate when people do that.Oh yeah. And let the customer finish eating before you tell your employees to take the plate. Put your self in our place. I don't want someone just taking my plate. But the staff are really nice, I just saw the owner telling them to take the plates.I love the fact that it is BYOB and foods great, staff are great. But the noise coming from the owner's. Ugh. Make me sick.One more thing. I saw one of the staff saving the fruits from the dirty and nasty table. Oh my god!!! That was something.If I were you, do not take"
why was my negative review removed off of the page when it was already published?
"We went there a while ago. First impression walking in was, really? Is this all? But still, we were down for anything as long as the food was fantastic. The waiter (a guy from the kitchen) was perfectly nice. Foodies as we are, we were ready to eat! After all, we had an impossible- borderline annoying- time getting a reservation. ��Anyways, the food was only OK. We've had much better around the city of Chicago for comparable prices, and those dinners all came with a better ambiance. But the real problem was that both my husband and I got brutal food poisoning from our dinners. I mean, the worst we've ever had, ever. I actually called them early the next day, and I was very nice on the phone- especially given the fact that I was up all night throwing up our our $250+ meal. I told them we ate"
"Went to Sunda to celebrate a birthday dinner with a group of 7. ��Service was exceptional, and the food was even better. ��Our server took so much time explaining the menu and helping us decide on the best options for our group. ��The Cod is a must try!"
"Best Falafel in Chicago! Some of the other dishes are good, but not amazing. The price is always right at Sultan's!"
"High quality, food wtih finesse. We love this place. The best salad bar and the best quality meats. Don't ever go away Fogoooo!! Great ambience and an even amazing service. Just pricey enough to make you say it was worth spending every single penny on it!"
"I watched you at MU, beating Kentucky, in the Final 4 vs. Kansas, watched as you became a world beater in Miami, wishing you were a Bull, rooting FOR you in '06 vs Dallas, and, until this year, still proud to state all of the above again and again, to anyone who would listen. ?In the span of a short NBA season, you have become a whiner, an instigator, a primadonna, and co-conspirator of a group of individuals playing a team sport (no, isolations and a pass don't make a team). ?Woe is me...the Heat are losing and this is what the world wants. ?Coughing and teasing Dirk on camera when the series is far from over. ?You let LeMoron get to you and brought you down. ?You won't care at all about a diatrabe like this from one of your previously biggest fans, and even 12 months ago, I think you wou"
"So...What's up with this street...Everything that opens up is so out there...This place is funky with a slight hint touch of Whigger.You know...Jamie Kennedy ""pound it""White guy acting black...So... sipping on my 40Patio is great, but I don't understand half of these concepts on this street. ��Only in Chicago..."
"I have been a lurking member of Yelp for years. Using it to find wonderful restaurants. This is the first time that I have been so blown away by a restaurant that I was moved to write a review.We had the tasting menu. Each course was spectacular, We kept thinking how can it possibly keep getting better. It did. The service and attention to detail is impressive.We will rush back."
"My wife and I drove from Louisville, Kentucky to Chicago for a New Year's celebration, and we made reservations at Sprout. ��Its a long way to go for an evening, but the food, service, and fun would have justified a drive to Alaska. ��It was our most fantastic dining experience, ever.Front-of-the-house was incredible. ��Although the restaurant was sold out, we greeted very warmly, led to a wonderful table in the main dining room, and given an excellent preview of the night's menu. ��A great way to start the night - we felt honored and valued, and from the looks of everyone around the restaurant, everyone was having a similar experience. ��Then Ginny, our server, stopped by to greet us, and the evening started.Each of the 10 courses was presented with a brief discussion of the ingredients, techn"
"Another restaurant in Chinatown with awesome food but terrible terrible service. ��The food was 5 stars but no star for service and decor. ��I was working in the southloop and deciced to take home some spicy food. ��While I was waiting inside the restaurant, I actually heard 'animals' fighting and running above the ceiling...are you kidding me? ��I was about to run outside. ��Come on, for being the most successful restaurant in the hood, do some clean-up on your space and management !!"
"Had a great time! ��The food is great and the line is not nearly as bad as it looks. ��They really run this place well, it's a nice mix between a sit down restaurant and a get it your self food counter.They find you a table and bring you the food but you need to get waters and silverware etc.For six people it was only $75 and that included 3 bloody mary's and coffee's for everyone."
"This place is my favorite eating and drinking spot in Chicago! ��You have to go there to see what I mean. ��If I were a millionaire, that would be my usual hang-out place (the food is a bit expensive but so healthy). �� Parking is a little tricky but if you drive around the block a bit, you will find street parking. ��Roof-top bar open in the summer, which makes it a trendy place for the young college crowd."
"This place makes me proud to live in Logan Square.Beer, OMG...they have the friggin' best selection...on tap, bottle, watevs.Food is outstanding, great burgers, apps (don't get the pizza though, kinda meh), slammin' bread pudding.Great looking spot, god bless the people who built this place.Late night socializing, lunch with mom, beer with the depressed buddy on a Tuesday at 4, it's all good...."
"it is Simply IT! ��nicest people ever...to a degree I can't explain unless you visit. ��Try the coconut mango beef or the pineapple calamari, or anything else, all winners, all delicious"
"Best BYOB in the city, have eaten here many times. You can ask your waiter to make you what he recommends and you will not be disappointed."
Salad bar was delicious and the wrap I had was good too. The atmosphere was fun and it was a great place to eat!
"I've been to this place many times and the food is always great!! ��The waitresses are always friendly and efficient. ��The only bad thing about this restaurant is the old guy who is the cashier. ��He is rude, snide and very unpersonable. ��I'm not sure if he is the owner, but if he is he needs to give the cash register job to someone who is friendly!"
"If you're visiting Chicago and looking for a great place to have breakfast near the the Loop and Grant Park, I don't think there is a better place. My mom would come to visit me while I attended school, and she not only remembered, but requested it whenever she would visit. What a great place, with great food and an excellent morning atmosphere. Start your day off right!"
"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of bone marrow. ��I love it, so any restaurant with it on the menu is automatically intriguing. ��I went there with high hopes one late afternoon and I wasn't disappointed. ��The Purple Pig does bone marrow right! ��Delicious crunchy bread, yummy bone marrow with salt, parsley and capers as garnish. ��The fried olives were fun. ��The artichoke and fingerling potato salad was nice and tangy. ��Great coffee too. ��If I lived in Chicago, the Purple pig would be in heavy rotation.Very pretty and european style set up inside. ��Nice outdoor seating."
"Was very disappointed with the food. The hummus was watery and somewhat bland; the falafel sandwich was merely mediocre. We decided to eat inside the restaurant, but found it dark, cavernous and uninviting. I will not be going back."
Fogo is absolutely amazing and the staff is very friendly. ��I absolutely love their homemade bread bowl salads where they make the bread bowl fresh in the brick oven! ��The pizza slices are huge and delicious. My favorite thing is the Coxina balls. ��This place is highly recommended and promises not to dissapoint :)
"My friends and I love it here! ��There is not one person I have taken here who has not been back again!The food is delicious and affordable and the people are always friendly! ��Plus, you can't beat the byob policy.I have never been disapointed when I have eaten here (or gotten delivery) and even first came here because, after studying abroad in Costa Rica, I was in search of some delicious Costa Rican food. ��It was spot on (no surprise since the owners are from there).I LOVE the Casada and recommend it to anyone as well as the oatmeal shake!!"
"I'm thrilled to hear about the pizza here because time after time, I get no further than the eggplant rollatini. Joyfully in a rut with this dish. Love this place and its fresh everything. All the textures and tastes are right on from bread, to salad, to cheeses and on and on. One of my favorite go-to spots for a notch above Italian meal in a neighborhood that's utterly charming and stroll-able day or night."
"My favorite Thai place in Chicago. (And thankfully not too far from my house.) The curry is strong, the atmosphere is pleasant, the service is polite, and the portions are perfect. I regularly get the Gaeng Pet Ped, crab rangoons, and jasmine tea. Just delicious. What more needs be said?"
"Great wine, great cheese = great night! And its righ along the chicago river so you can take a beuatiful walk after words!"
"I came here because I've never had Ethiopian food, and the reviews on yelp directed me to Demera. The waitres recommended the Demera Messob. ��The food on the plate was ok- fish curry, lentils, spinach, a salad, goat curry, shrimp curry, and a beet-mixture. ��My problem lies in the bread. ��It was cold, looked and felt like sticky carpet lining, and tasted awful. ��This bread left a nasty taste in my mouth, and had me nauseated until the next day."
"Every steak at this great resturant is served up on a sizzling platter and that best describes my eating experience here several times: sizzling. The staff from greeters, to managers, bus boys to our favorite waiter, Eioghan creates an ""at home"" environment that keeps me coming back. Suggesting new dishes, having our favorite cocktails and beverages waiting for us makes is a special night out. Between the cowboy, the new spicy lobster appetizer to the creme brulee it was a meal unmatched in prep and delivery, warm complimentary service and even the car valets greet you like an old friend. And that's what it feels like here, eating with family and old friends. Again, this is THE place over all the others that gets my vote for best steak dinner in the Windy City. The Burbridges!"
Went there for lunch. Sublime food and excellent personal service. Will be back with friends ASAP for diner. Highly recommended!
cheese sticks and good sausage deep dish. Ceasar salad was okay. Good place to take visitors.
"It's ok. ��The place firmly rests on it's historical laurels. Mediocre service, very snotty doorman, just ok drinks. ��The music is usually quite good, but again not epic. �� I wouldn't call the decor preserved, it just hasn't been touched since the Capone days."
"I have ordered my niece's birthday cake from here every year (going on 3 years now - she'll be 4) and they've been fabulous! For her 2nd birthday, the theme was a luau and they created standing palm trees, etc. It wowed everyone! Last year was the ballerina cake and this year...dinosaurs. (Can't wait to see what they'll do!) The cakes are as delicious as they are creative."
I gave this place the best rating because of the food alone. I read other reviews on yelp that had no compliants but only gave 4 stars- I guess the only way those reviewers would give 5 stars is if the food was also free. I have had the Ahogada and the cubana both delicious. However I'm vietnamese so I love soups as meals but I am extremely picky about them. I was actually reluctant to try the caldos here for fear that I would be disappointed. I orderd the Fideo and really loved it. The broth was complex and the texture of the ingredients complimented the flavors. The pork belly was insanely good. No wonder there is a screen blocking your view of how they make their caldos. As for service. I thought for how busy this place is the staff balances it by being very pleasant- full of smiles and
"OK, I am sure you know why I took ��away a star: the line to get in is extremely too long. Don't go hungry because it will take you 30 minutes to get inside.BUT- the remaining 4 stars is because Hot Doug's is the best Hot Dog place in the entire galaxy! If Aliens land: take them to Hot Doug's for a rattlesnake dog with honey drizzle and blue cheese! mmmmmm Add some duck fried fries and you are set for some intergalactic deliciousness! Their menu is always changing and is always fun. Order at least 2 dogs and make sure you vary your selection each time. Expect to pay $10-15 and you'll be super fine!!!yummy yummy yummy!!!! Bring some friends to pass the time ��in the stupid line."
"Been going to Ruth's Chris Steak House for quite some time, way before it was used in Hip Hop lol...Steaks are still great, but the place could use a good cleaning....Service is ok, but it definitely seems like this place is losing it's edge in my opinion....oh and WATCH OUT HOT PLATE!"
"I experienced Piece for the first time today and was I disappointed... in the service! My coworker and I had to wait one hour for a medium pizza and it was extremely greasy. The server was slower than molasses! I will, however, return for the beer. They've got a great selection."
Sat for 15 minutes and never even got approached for our drink order. As we were getting up to leave a waiter came up to us but we still left based on principle. Food did look good so I'll give it 1 star.
"Easy to find, just a 2 minute walk from the blue line station. I sat at the bar. The waitress was extremely nice. She accidentally spilled infront of me a bloody Mary that she was preparing. She apologized repeatedly and gave me an employee discount. Woohoo :) I had a vegetarian egg croissant which was good. The best part of it was the croissant itself which was delish. I also had the pretzel white chocolate pancake which was superb. I will probably need the recipe."
"The food is amazing, unfortunately you have to deal with a rude host stand and snotty server to enjoy it.It's a shame, with a menu as impressive and delish as this, you would think the staff would have better service skills. ��There are other places to grab sushi in the city with just as great a menu and a cheerful, more knowledgeable staff. ��Check out my review for Sushi Samba."
I sat on the covered patio area and was provided decent service. The food was good too. Very comfortable atmosphere.
"I have only had the mussels and they are great and more than enough.The fries are awesome and extra good because I always forget they come with the mussels!Unhappily, I don't care much for most of their beers, I'm not a big Belgian beer fan. ��There's one I like but I can never remember which one.But I love this place! ��Its a great joint to have a pre-drinking drinking snack."
"Fantastic! Make sure to make a reservation and request a booth - they have dividers between them that go up to the ceiling and pulled back curtains on the sides that afford the feeling of privacy that aids in the intimate feel of this place. ��My husband and I just got the cheese and chocolate and were a little concerned it wouldn't be enough for dinner. ��Wow, were we wrong! I felt feeling incredibly full and satisfied. ��It's true it's a little pricey if you want a meat plate, but I'd argue that the smaller options are even better (ok, so I'm biased as a vegetarian) and plenty of food. ��Definitely worth it for a nice night out."
"First off, what's with three places on one street corner with the same name? ��We had to walk into two places before we found the right La Pasadita. ��Second, apart from what some of the reviews said, this is not the best Mexican fare in town. ��It's ok, but not great. ��The nachos were gross and the burrito was ok. ��I personally prefer Picante over by Damen/Division, which is definitely the best mexican food in Ukrainian Village and Wicker Park combined."
"Thank goodness for yelp! The hubby and I were looking for a bomb brunch spot in CHI and found it! Worth the hour wait! And while the outside could use a little more work (we walked right by it at first), the atmosphere inside is warm and the staff uuber friendly...We had the BLT Benedict, blueberry hotcakes and a BEC (bacon, egg, cheese) croissant...say what, say who now?! Lol...ALL AMAZING DISHES! If you want delicious pancakes that require no syrup, please go to Bongo...from red velvet, white chocolate-caramel-pretzel, and raspberry oreo flavors...these pancakes alone sells this place. Nice job Chicago!"
"very bad experience in here, I got very sick after I ate at this place."
"Loved it. Food was great, service was professional. Host staff very organized."
"We had dinner here, last night. ��Everything was outstanding. ��The moment you enter this restaurant, you know you are somewhere wonderful! ��The staff greeting is in the most friendly fashion. ��Everything is beautifully arranged and well planned. ��The food is of exceptional quality. ��The service is caring. ��We think this is the finest addition to Chicago dining, and look forward to many more terrific meals here."
"Expensive, sure..... executive service with skilled servers. Have a question, knowledgeable staff is ready and waiting. The salad bar is outstanding, it's a meal in itself - many a veggi perished @ my fork. Plenty of variety. The meats were excellent - I've been here maybe 6 or 7 times and never had a bad experience. It's all you can eat and never once did I hear,  Sir we are closing our doors, it's time to go. Good experience with the valet service, quick and friendly. Not a great drink selection, but you don't come here to drink. The hosts are very friendly and someone always comes by to check to see that our visit is going well. Been to other Brazillian steakhouse, but this one set the bar. Only if they let us take doggy bags home."
"Love love love it! Wilde is my favorite restaurant in the city! Great atmosphere, great food, great drinks!"
"We went to Shaw's Crab House for some good seafood cravings. We were not impressed with the food or the service, we expected more.My review is focusing on the food/service/ambiance we experience, not on why you are there or who is paying for the meal.We had the oyster sampler which was excellent to be expected. ��Although the frozen vinagrette sauce was a bit overwhelming, not a good match to delicate fresh oyster flavors. ��Nothing beats some few drops of lemmon juice to bring them alive! But I would recommend this appetizer.The bread basket was interesting but removed and took multiple requests to two waiters/bus persons to get it back. ��Our waitress was missing in action most of the time. ��Lobster bisque was good, but small portion and no lobster chunks to speak of.We had the Walleye fres"
"I have been going to Pequod's for about 5 years now. I love the pizza. That said, I have completely stopped ordering from them because of how often they have screwed up my orders. Not once, not twice, and get this... not even three times. They have screwed up FOUR delivery orders in a row. Once, I got someone else's pizza. Yeah, you heard me right. Another time, they left out my appetizers and had the nerve to ask me if I STILL wanted them! EXCUSE ME? Another time I got the wrong toppings completely. It wasn't even close. Ugh, this is taking me down a dark path now. I'll just end this by saying the last time I went to Pequod's to sit down with a few friends, we waited 90 minutes after being told it was a 30-minute wait. I haven't been back since.I kept giving them the benefit of the doubt,"
Great thin crust pizza! ��Try the BBQ Chicken with bacon..yummm
"Absolutely LOVEd this place! The food was amazing and in HUGE quantities. Plus, considering the area, the prices were pretty cheap. If you go with only one other person ask for a window seat. They overlook Michigan Avenue and it's a wonderful view while you're eating. The first time I was there I ordered the Bento Box lunch special. It was awesome! The next time I ordered some chicken but I can't remember what kind. Again, AWESOME! So much food I couldn't possibly finish it! I loved everything about this place and will definitely be returning next time I'm downtown."
"I was never a big fan of Mexican food, but I'm a fan of Nuevo Leon. ��The moment you sit down freshly fried tortillas and two different variety of home made salsas are served, a fantastic start. ��They have the best tacos I've ever had bar none and it's called Tacos Daniel. ��This is an authentic version that is not on the menu consisting ��of seasoned beef rib meat, cilantro, and guacamole (optional) on a soft tortilla. I like adding their salsa ��to my tacos which really complements its ��flavor. ��In addition, Chicken Tinga, tamales, and banilla cheese is a must try.Stay away from the beef fajitas, the beef can be quite tough, good for a good headache from chewing so hard. ��Service is just adequate, but then again this is a modestly priced casual restaurant so don't expect too much in that are"
"The grilled cheese is amazing. ��I've been here twice. ��The first time, I loved everything. ��The second time, I got more adventurous and was a little disappointed. ��Great place for a special night out."
Best persian food! Hands down..
"First, we waited for over an hour, but the restaurant wasn't full. ��That put me in a bad mood. ��The floors were slippery . Once we got seated, we ordered some buffalo chicken rolls. ��This brought my mood around. ��I ordered a drink. ��It was average. ��There seemed to be some greasy people working up in there. ��Our waitress started out nice, but things turned ugly when our food came out late, and wrong. ��They comped us the messed up order. ��The food was pretty good.A couple more drinks and I was good to go. ��Overall it was not the worst or the best, just okay."
"Wow, words can't express how thankful I am that Grant Achatz is living in my side of town, making my experience living in Chicago that much better with his work of art: his food!Alinea is easily one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. ��The service was impeccable, the variety on the menu makes you want to try everything, and the food is flavorful and engaging to the soul! Give it a try, you will definitely go back for a 2nd, 3rd, and so on time! Bon appetite!"
"Shaw's is a classic New England style seafood restaurant with great food and great service. It has been around for many years and each time we dine we come away feeling good. Their King Crab is great quality and plentiful. ��They have many types of oysters including my favorite, Oysters Rockifeller (cooked!). They have a nice wine list and good martinis as well. Shaw's is a comforting place a midst the come-and-go restaurants that are so abundant in Chicago."
"Now this is my favorite restaurant in the city. I love the fact that in the dining room, there are millionaires eating next to average white collar workers. ��People eating meatloaf next to whole lobsters. Just a great atmosphere in the dining room. ��Also, for lunch, can't beat the Blue Oyster Bar."
"this business has declined in customer service!! i have been a faithful customer to this restaurant for many years even before they had remolded it. i went to garcias with my family and as soon as we arrived the waitress saw us and didn't acknowledge us! a waiter who was taking a order from another table saw us and apologized on her behalf, he said she had just finished arguing with another coworker. how unprofessional was that!, i was still listening to them argue in spanish, and to make matters worse she ended up being our waitress. she had such a horrible attitude, and got our orders mixed up. the worst part is i went to talk to the manager about the experience and it was this young guy which i don't think he was the manager, and he said was ""i'll talk to her"". so unprofessional, the fo"
"Make Alinea a destination in your life, you won't be disappointed. Food, service, setting and ambiance are all stellar. A food-lover's paradise on Earth. Nuff said."
"Went her last Saturday night on the suggestion of my sister and loved it! ��Much better location than the Wrigley one and a much better space. ��Great beer menu, including some of my favorites from Hopleaf, and and even better dinner menu. ��Started with the sweet potato fries with goat cheese dipping sauce (could have drank the rest down, it was so good)... ��My boyfriend said his meatloaf was some of, if not THE best his ever had. ��I had the pumpkin ravioli with hazelnuts and gorganzola which was also amazing. ��Unfortunately, we had no room left for dessert. ��We will definitely be going back!!!"
"Amazing sourdough bread. ��Great service, overwhelming variety and good-great quality for Sunday brunch."
"I've been here three different times, and I've always had a special experience. I think that the BYOB aspect of the place might be essential for some to venture out to this area of Logan Square but I don't think that this"
"Not good for kids, huh? Well, I guess no other kid is like me then! I ordered the chestnut ricotta ravioli and even if I'm not like any other kid, NO kid can pass up on dessert! With that in mind, I also ordered the chocolate ganache cake and oh my god. It was all great. The pasta was cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of chestnut mixed with the ricotta. The carmelized onions, at first weren't exactly my thing, but the more I ate the more I liked them. As for the cake, normally I like moist cakes, and this cake wasn't very moist. It wasn't DRY, but you know.... But this was perfect because the ganache and the vanilla whipped cream, and even the frosting balanced it out beautifully. It wasn't too sweet, and it was very ark chocolate-y. Love, love, love! 10/10! 5 stars! 2 enthusiastic "
"One of my husband and my favorite restaurant worldwide.Went there on our 7th, 9th and 10th year anniversary, never disappointed.Spent about $200.00 per person, though it was the best bargain in town.Their after-dinner pastry is simply amazing, can't wait til go back again."
"I really, really wanted to like this place. ��I called and placed a delivery order tonight and was told that they were super busy ��- delivery time was an hour and a half (this was at 7pm). ��I was fine with that. ��Finally, at 8:45pm (1 hour and 45 minutes later) my pizza finally arrived. ��When I open it, it was COLD!!!....not even luke warm. ��I still gave them the benefit of the doubt because they told me when I order that they were really, really busy so I reheated my pizza. ��I decided that I should call them, just to let them know that the pizza I received was very cold.When I called the restaurant, the girl who answered the phone was said that she was sorry. ��After talking with her and telling her that I ended up re-heating the pizza (because she asked if I still had the pizza, really???)"
When you think of BBQ and chicken the first thing i think of the Crisp. Their Sassy Chicken wing are one of the best in the city.This is a must try for any fried chicken lover in the Chicago land area!
This place is a classic and a must to go at least once in your life even if your not into Jazz. I took some visitors from out of town who wanted to experience a great Jazz joint The Green Mill is the first place I thought of. The Mill gets very crowded so if you want a seat go early. They have great drinks of all kinds and the staff is usually great. Different acts to see and just a over all great experience.
"I went to Irazu for dinner with a friend last week. ��There was a bit of a wait, but we just made ourselves comfortable outside and after about 15 minutes, the hostess came and got us and brought us to our table. ��BYOB we brought a few beers that we hoped would go well with our authentic Costa Rican meal, and were pleasantly surprised when our hostess complimented our choice. ��Having never been to Costa Rica I had no idea what to expect so we deferred to our server who was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. ��Each of us ordered one of the more traditional Costa Rican meals and were more than satisfied with the quality, quantity, and flavor! ��I became lost in finding all the best parts of my meal, and before I knew it, it was gone! ��I had heard such great things about the oatmeal shake, "
"I have never understood the hoopla surrounding Hopleaf. Yes, it has a million beers and even an extensive wine list. But the crowd that surrounds this place reminds me of bees swarming a honeycomb and it is what keeps me far, far away. Before checkplease and other media that this place received, it used to be a quaint and quiet neighborhood place. Now, it feels like the entire art district of Wickerpark and Bucktown has transcended on Andersonville. Don't even think about getting a table on almost any night of the week in the bar area. THANK GOD it is now a non-smoking establishment. But just walking by the place, I feel my lungs collapsing from smoke inhalation. Smoking must be a requirement for every person who goes to Hopleaf. I do feel devious that I can't wait to watch those hipsters "
"Good pizza and a nice thin crust. I can't deal with the thick, Chicago-style pizzas. The service is good, the prices are within reason and the environment is fun. I love the nights that they have live band karaoke. I can live out my fantasy of being a rock and roller."
"The 3rd Coast Cafe is a simple, but elegant Gold Coast coffee/wine bar without the stuffiness of the Gold Coast. From the hummos dish to the turkey club and crab cakes benedict, they serve delicious plates all-around. The staff is quite friendly too. Good for breakfast, lunch or dinner to dine and unwind."
We came to the City for our Anniversary! My wife and I are very food picky...At Cafe 28 we were in heaven from the service to the fresh qualtiy. We can't wait to round the kids up and bring them back soon . Thanks for all your wonderful service and food!!!!
"Went with my fianc�� for dinner, we actually wanted to try it for lunch first but after waiting a few months for them to open for lunch we figured we would go after the holiday it turns out they are not open for lunch anymore, what was is a month they were open for lunch only??The salad bar was okay, the meats in my opinion are low quality, hardly any flavor, some what tough and some even had a liver after taste to them! ��Service was not very helpful even thought they were not busy on the night we went. ��We will definitely not return. ��I recently received a $25 Gift Card from another Brazilian place not sure if we want to try another one for a while!"
"It helps to know people here. ��After waiting and waiting in the cramped entry or out on the sidewalk, several times I've witnessed people walk-in without beeper and be seated immediately or at the next-available table. ��Topping that, is the hostess' attitude. There is one hostess who always works weekends and she is without fail, always rude to me and my husband. ��In reading thru other reviews, it appears her attitude extends beyond just the two of us!While the food is fresh and delicious (why else would there be such long waits!?), it is also served fast, which is what draws me here. ��Getting past the long waits and rude treatment by the hostess, the remaining wait staff is charming and sweet.Meli wont' care about my review, but don't say you haven't been warned.I've taken my business els"
"We really like this place. ��The best time to go is before 10 on the weekends and when there is nice weather. ��The outdoor seating fills up quick and it is great to grab a spot and people watch. ��Don't be too scared of the line - it usually goes fast. ��Everyone that works here is nice and things run very smoothly. ��Both breakfast and lunch are good and I find the prices very accurate to the amount and quality of food and the atmosphere.Kid Friendly - Definitely. ��Although small inside, there are always children. In the warmer months you can see strollers lined up outside and in the winter, surprisingly, strollers will fit inside! ��They have an abundant amount of high chairs and the staff are friendly with assisting. ��The background noise is at or above my sons - so it works out perfectly."
"I love this place. Oatmeal shakes, which I hafta have every single time.The empanadas are great for whatever mood you are in, sweet or savory. Casual, fair price, great closed in patio!"
"I rave about this place to ANYONE from the burbs who wants to eat out somewhere that isn't a chain. ��I always take them here. ��The waithelp is okay, just takes our order and leaves, which is okay, but takes a while to get a water refill. ��It's also BYOB which is nice to bring a bottle of wine to have with dinner. ��The seasonings on their meats are TO DIE FOR! ��I couldn't get enough of the steak!! ��Just writing about it makes me want to eat there tonight!!"
"If you've heard of Pho but haven't experienced it...this is THE place to loose your ""Pho virginity""...There is something about the entire experience of Pho Xe Tang (better known as Tank Noodle). First, there is the extensive menu. ��It's in Vietnamese with bad English translation and is pages long. ��You have to have one of the Pho's when you're here but don't skip the appetizers. ��I recommend the Shrimp Spring Rolls. ��Some of the ingredients in the traditional Beef Pho's sound scary (Tendon, Tripe, etc.) but it makes the experience that much better.Second, the table arrangment. ��Most of the tables are communal, you sit with other people at long tables. ��The flatware, chopsticks & noodle spoons are in holders in the middle. ��Everybody is very friendly and if you're lucky you will be sitting "
"Despite the amazing variety of tasty servings, we were disappointed by the poor time management of the chef. We waited 20 minutes for our coffee and desert and finally just left without them at midnight. ��At most restaurants, this would not be worth mentioning, but at Alinea one expects perfection especially with the $650 price tag for two. ��It was late and we had traveled that morning so the delay really impacted our enjoyment of the evening. ��It was such a shame that we walked out of this amazing restaurant a little miffed. But when you charge that much for a meal, expectations are high. ��My recommendation is that Alinea is missable."
"The atmposphere was nice. I went here a month ago and I enjoyed everything. The server was very nice and understood that I wanted to be away in a secluded section with my partner. The food was good. I personally enjoyed the Baked Clams and had to order a 2nd one to go. I ended up getting the Sausage pizza and the found the cheese to be a bit greasy, but that is what I always experience from places that serve pizzas.Overall, had a great experience and will definitely be back. Maybe for Valentine's day"
Food decent but the service is terrible. We were sat at table promptly but it was all down hill after that. ��We never got water. They took forever to take our order. They brought one of our main beef dishes and after waiting and waiting for our chicken dish 30 minutes had gone by. We asked about the other entrees and we were told they had run out of chicken and by the way sorry we didn't tell you sooner. We were given a menu to select something else but they never came back to take our revised order. ��We paid for the one entree and left never to return again. I don't know who their focus is but I know it is not their customer.
Best hot dogs in Chicago. Fries fried in duck fat. Only bad thing is the line to order.
"Just read the other reviews, and agree with them - you may as well, since you won't find a better burger, a better wait staff, a more competent management. ��I'm telling you: there's stuff happening at this place that you'll never know about, but you will love throwing a fantasy here and there as you watch exotic, beautiful women talking to men less attractive but probably employed. ��Assignations? ��I'd bet. ��Ah... to be younger and have more teeth.... ��When was the last time a waiter told you to take the less expensive burger - and the reasons were cogent, thoughtful? ��Oh... that Scotch egg thing - fabulous. ��The dessert menu? ��So good you could chant it and get donations. ��Try it."
"THE place for jazz. ��Everybody else posting here pretty much nailed the decor and ambiance. A total step back in time. Now mind you, this is traditional jazz--piano, brushes on the snare, upright bassist...Never got that into jazz in its purist form--try the underground wonder bar in gold coast for the contemporary form with alot of energy. ��Unfortunately, lots of jazz snobs telling you not to talk. ��I mean , I like to hear the music too, but I also don't want to just sit in a library either. Sometimes the whole room just sits in absolute silence--kinda weird especially if you want to talk with your date.Gets pretty crowded the later it gets--you might end up standing. ��Poetry slam on sundays--kinda like sitting in someone's living room and playing charades..it's fun though, really!Lots of"
"Best mexican food in the city. Steak tacos and carne asada dinner - cant go wrong with either of those. Also try the frijoles con chorizo, it rocks!"
This place is worth the wait ! Everything is delicious. There's a lot food to choose from. They have kids menus! love this place!
"This place is good, but we've always had to wait. ��Overall, I would say, it's not the best dinner option in the area. ��If you're just looking for something a little more casual and just as tasty, I'd recommend Picante, Lou Malnatis and Smoke Daddy. ��They're not as expensive, but just as good."
Hostess: TERRIBLE. Advice: If you don't enjoy your job get another one.Seating was awful. Had to request reseating since we did not want to sit in the bathroom.Wait staff was good.Enjoyed the food.If you want to have a good time with friends do not go here. There are so many other restaurants that want your business and will be sure you have a nice evening. Not this place.I repeat.....the hostess is terrible.
"Pizza was average at best. Dry and doughy. Also if you want to order something other than ""by the slice"" it's a 45 minute wait. No ambiance at all...... Basically a strip mall joint with cheap tables and zero decor. If this is the ""best"" pizza in Chicago I'll go to Jets Pizza instead and know that the pizza will be fresh!"
"I've been to Lockdown several times (and ordered delivery probably more times that I have eaten in the restaurant). ��I'm not a ""metal"" person per say but a lot of people I hang with are and I love loud music so I'm not phased by the loud metal theme of the bar. ��When I go to a restaurant the ambiance helps but I'm really concerned about the service and the food. ��Lockdown WINS on both counts. ��I know they had some ups and downs with their food, as most start up business's do, they needed time and the right people to make it all work. ��I think they are definitely getting there. ��I am a lover of a good burger and there are plenty to choose from at Lockdown! ��This changes periodically but currently my favorite burger at Lockdown is the Border Patrol...I mean carnitas and jalapenos on a burger"
"Probably one of the most overrated pizza joints in Chicago. Over the years, I've heard so many people rave about this place, so when my dinner plans in wicker park didn't work out, I decided to finally cross this place off my list of places to try. Everybody says to try the brews, but not being much of a drinker, I was there for the food.Started off with spinach/tomato dip appetizer. Big mistake. Not only were there almost no tomatoes in it, they served it with what seemed to be non-flavored Doritos... Really?!? I'm not a snob that needs anything fancy, and I have no problem paying extra for quality, but to charge people $7 bucks for something so obviously cheap is just wrong. The dip itself was just ok tasting, and I would have had no complaint if it cost half that price, but that dip wou"
Hands down the best. I don't mean of that type of restaraunt. I mean the best place to eat. period.
"I was here last night, and my experience pushed me to sign up on Yelp, since I use the reviews to navigate towards great experiences. Ambiance is nice, waitstaff is friendly & atttentive, but the food...I had a combination platter with my boyfriend-forget the name of the platter, but the pork ribs were horrible. I can't believe they actually serve that to people-I wouldn't feed that to a wild animal. The chicken was just ok, but I figured, well, I didnt come here for chicken. The plantane was really good, and the potatoes were just ok too. Chorizo was pretty good-I could have had a plate of that by itself. Overall the food-was ""meh, ok"".My favorite part of my meal was the sangria. It was really good-$24.00 for a pitcher, not too shabby. I brought wine, but couldnt stomach the $8.00 corkage"
"Shaw's Bar is worth the tight fit, for friendly faces, and a kick ass oyster bar! If you want service in the bar, Jessica will warm your heart, and suggest awesome sushi rolls! Maybe I will venture in the dinning room someday, but I like the high energy, while I peel my crab crab legs and eat like a cast away! :-P...."
The way stuffed pizza is supposed to taste.
"Looking hear for some other people's experiences because, my two breakfast experiences here have left me way less than satisfied.I want to love the place but, the items I have ordered were overpriced for for breakfast ��considering the dishes were very uneventful. ��French toast needed tons of butter and syrup just to get to be worth even eating and, the homemade biscuits were dry and cold.The eggs have been great but, it's hard to mess up eggs. ��I'd like to try it for the seafood, maybe that's their talent. ��I say the breakfast isn't. ��I'll give em credit for good and friendly service."
"This was not the first visit for me at this well-known establishment but it may well be the last. ��The bar area has a better ambience and a more jolly atmosphere than the main dining area which is cramped and uninviting. ��If it was not for the art, the dining area would have no ambience at all. I could expand on this point, but that's not what prompted me to write this review. One can always make excuses for bad service, but on this occasion there was no excuse. It was a Tuesday night and the service was appalling, possibly the worst I have experienced in a long while from an unattentive, nonchalant wait staff that, quite frankly, could not have cared less. Perhaps Rick Bayless should spend less time spinning his take on organic food prep and authentic recipes and take the time to discover"
Great Italian style pizza and love the Italian Sodas
Delicious authentic Mediterranean cuisine with a wonderful atmosphere. I highly recommend any seafood from the grill. The grilled octopus is AH-mazing!
"great place. booked fifty/50 for my birthday on a friday nite, wanted above average bar food with a good atmosphere for my small group of ten. ��amazingly helpful with planning & answering questions. professional, but very to-the-point...really appreciated it. my groups spans from city dwellers to suburbanites..and everyone felt comfortable. it was a great crowd. food was awesome, service was top notch, everyone on the staff was super friendly, from the bartenders to the busboys."
"Ok, so I thought this was going to be another one of those places that you see pop up just because it's popular. Boy, was I wrong, this is the place to go for a great time with some friends or on a date. Oh, let me tell you, call ahead and get a reservation. I want to thank my buddy for hosting our party here. I had a great time."
"Sabatinos is my favorite Italian restaurant! ��The food and service is excellent. ��They have everything to cater to everyone's tastes and are reasonably priced. ��Portions are huge (enough for at least 2 meals), but my favorite part about this place is the table side desserts. ��You can chosse from several desserts including bananas foster, cherries jubilee, or baked alaska and the owners prepare themselves at your table. ��This restaturant is not just a place to have a meal, rather a place for entertainment. ��Don't go here for a quick bite, rather plan on staying for at least 2 hours, as the meal is also a presentaion! ��They even have private booths for a romantic night out."
"Can't rate the food, since we were VERY RUDELY told by the manager that the place was closed at 10:30pm even though the sign on the door said they were opened 'til midnight. ��When asked why the sign said midnight, the manager again RUDELY barked at us that they were closing early to have some work done inside the restaurant. ��Sorry, but no matter how great the food may be, I would never give my money to an establishment that employed such rude and discourteous employees!!!!!!"
"I don't get the hype, However i am Russian by birth and perhaps its all too greasy and American for my taste buds. I also don't understand why people line up in the cold, to pay $10.00 for the hotdogs...Three stars for the cute friendly Doug."
"I've been a fan of Sunda for a few years now. We make it an annual stop for our convention calendar. I took the family this last time. Great experience as usual.Our server was great, made some great suggestions although we were a bit disappointed with the crispy rice sushi. We ordered a carafe of the sangria. Interesting but pretty bland so we added some of the mango syrup from our kids beverages and we were back in the saddle. Our show season starts at the end of the month so we'll surely be back."
"Today I came in and met Doug, who I presume to be an owner or at least a half-owner. I start my review by saying this because I think it's significant; your first impression of Crisp will be that it's a trendy type of place but is run by a very down-to-earth owner. He will ask you for your name and then for your order.I came in for the chicken wings, which were delicious. They're fried and covered in several sauces. Out of the sauces I had, the Seoul Sassy was tasty and on the milder side, while the Crisp BBQ was a lot spicier and bolder. The latter had much of the same spicy flavor you would find in kimchi (without the fermented taste, of course), but also had a sweet component like a BBQ sauce. I may have liked them a bit spicier, even, to balance out the sweet, but I think fans of BBQ w"
the food and service was amazing. 5 stars.
"There's something very impressive about a guy who could whip up a four-course meal that would kick your ass, but who chooses to use his gifts for something he really, really loves.The atmosphere is kooky and a little old-school. ��You get the feeling he's got a lot of fans who probably send a lot of gifts, but for good reason - the food is incredible. ��Aside from having a pretty decent Chicago-style hot dog, it's the specialty menu that would keep me coming back time and time again. ��My very first specialty dog was a buffalo-ale and chipotle stuffed sausage with La Fin du Monde mustard and harvati cheese. ��It was epic. ��My tastebuds weren't prepared for the exquisite deliciousness that I forced upon them; they loved it. ��I've also had the pleasure of enjoying a bell pepper chicken sausage w"
Still the best food around. Wish they would open one in a less touristy part of town. Don't the like the see and be seen aspect of it.
"The tables were too cramped together for this fine dining restaurant. We had no privacy what-so-ever. The service was sub-par, there was no menu explanation, even after we were asked if it was our first time there, which it was. The appetizer we ordered was calamari, shrimp and crab cakes. What we were brought was a sorry display of some fried seafood that would not even match Red Lobster. Overall, for the price we paid, the food and service were nothing like we had expected and we will not be returning."
"Fantastic place overall. ��I/we usually get the same thing(chicken tikka masala and chicken vindaloo). ��Tikka masala has more flavor and tastier than the vindaloo while vindaloo is bit more spicier. ��Only downside I can think of is it can get pricey due to the location of the restaurant(it is in prime location so everything is relative). ��You have to order rice and naan ala carte. ��Also, parking is ridiculously expensive in the area and its not the restaurant's fault. ��I still come because food is good and at least once a month, I need a good internal flushing of the human organs. ��Solid restaurant overall. ��Would definitely recommend."
"Unquestionably delicious! I have grown up on La Villa food and 23 years later the food is nothing short of outstanding. While I am a picky eater EVERYTHING I have had at La Villa has please my palate. The pizza here is out of this world fresh. As I was interested in what made their pizza different from others I asked and was informed that everything from the dough to the sauce is homemade. My favorite pasta dish here is the bow tie with vodka sauce added with chicken. Every restaurant I go to, the vodka sauce tastes different, and this place has got it right on the dot! If fish is your thing I would try the Zuppa de Pesch. The Chicken A La Villa is also my favorite. Overall, the price is incredible for the amount of food you get, the service is quick, and ��the employees are always there ma"
Yummy is all I can say. ��If you like sushi you will love coast the WHite Dragon is awesome. ��We went with another and ordered a bunch of stuff all of it was just delicious the desserts are mouth watering all great. ��Another wonderful BYOB!
"My 18 year old daughter and I went to Sunda on April 1st for dinner. ��I made last minute reservations and they were only able to get us in at the sushi bar, but that was okay -- especially since those who were walking in at the same time as we did who didn't have reservations were told that the wait was over an hour!The service was great! ��Our server made recommendations that were OUTSTANDING! ��She was there when we need her to be and that was all that mattered! ��The room was filled with what looked to be groups of people - all having a great time and great conversation. ��The restaurant was very loud, so be prepared to use your outside voice during dinner conversation. ��I'm not sure if that was just where we were sitting, but it was very loud. ��But, we didn't mind since we were there for t"
Was there this past Saturday for breakfast. They do chilaquiles right! Excellent depth of flavor to all their dishes and an excellent level of heat. They have thee best refried beans in the city! Service is warm and attentive even when busy. Serious good eats for two and we didn't even spend 20 dollars!!!
"I used to love this place but now it takes forever to get in, the wait is over an hour easily and I feel like the food was better before. Try the one on roosevelt for a shorter wait time"
"My taste buds were saying Hallelujah! A friend recommended having dinner at Nana for a BYOB dinner which are always so much fun. We traveled to Comiskey Territory to sample Nana's recently opened dinner service. Known for its brunch, Nana's dinner service did not disappoint. We started with a cheese platter of fantastic fragrant cheeses, figs, and nuts and the Blue Cheese was so good I wanted to take a bath in it! We also tried the Heirloom Tomatoes with their fresh organic basil drizzled with balsamic vinegar which had my taste buds doing a happy dance. There is nothing better than a fresh tomato dish to announce the beginning of summer. We were also delighted by Asparagus topped with foraged mushrooms which is a stand out. This is organic food at its best, fresh and simple and oh so tast"
"My second visit to Hopleaf was a difference experience than my first (although my wife isn't convinced enough to give it a second chance, calling it snobbish, pretentious, expensive and with a lackluster menu and quality to match.) Where on the first visit, the waitress was unhelpful and intimidating enough to allow me to screw up my beer order, the waitress on this visit was friendly and perfectly willing not to condescend when I asked her to describe the taste of mussels and very quick to offer suggestions on the pairing of a Belgian beer with them.As recent convert to a limited selection of seafood, eating mussels seemed like a long shot. But they were delicious, served in a white wine sauce with vegetables. And the Tripel (don't ask me what it was; I can't find it in the million-page b"
"At first I was so excited to find a decent brunch place in Bridgeport that I didn't worry at all about the prices. Stuffed french toast and delicious variations on eggs benedict? Perfect! But I was a little disappointed that I paid so much for such a tiny glass of apple juice - especially when the Mexican restaurant down the street offers three times the amount freshly squeezed juice for the same price. BUT the atmosphere is great, and sometimes that can make all the difference. I can't wait to try the dinner menu everyone is raving about!"
Juicy steaks Don't miss out on their key lime pie!
"Really felt out of place. Not really my crowd, but the food was awesome. I know they get busy and have a schedule.... I did feel a little rushed to eat and get out and would have liked not to be put on a schedule. Service was very prompt and clearly the staff knows what they were doing. The steaks are just excellent all around. Still I think I would rather be in my back yard."
"one of my fave steak houses! service was good and the food didn't take long to come out. the server was very sweet; charming, but didn't talk too much like many servers I've encountered at other restaurants."
"The dozen times I've been here over the past 2 years must count for something. They're a hike from my apartment but I make the trek for the delicious breakfast. If you're around on the weekend, order the Huevos Rancheros for an awesome treat, but really everything there is delicious. What they say about the layout and service are my one star deduction. Enjoy!"
badasss!!
"We had the 12 course meal with the wine pairing. All the dishes were so interesting, the presentation stunning! The bite-size portion was perfect and the special dishes were one of a kind. Some things popped in the mouth, spilling out interesting flavors. The wine pairing was good at times and seemed unmatched at other times. But to be truthful, the food wasn't as tasty as I was expecting it to be. Or maybe my expectations were too high."
"I've only had the wings, which were very good. I mean these are the best wings I have ever eaten. But there were a lot of cons....1) Parking is hard to find2) It's pretty expensive. The chicken is superior to brands like KFC and Popeyes, but in terms of price and quality combined, I will go for the competitors.3) On a very busy night expect to wait a long time. This is a small complaint, but at least there's other stores around so you can walk around while you wait.4) This is my biggest complaint. The guy behind the counter has an attitude problem. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why, but if I had to try to explain it, it's like OK your done, get the f out of here now. Who's next? Given all these cons, I won't mind going back, since the chicken was good, but I won't go on a regular basis."
"This is close to a 5 start. ��The sandwiches were fabulous! ��I had theMilanesa which is: Crispy chicken, black beans, artisan Jack cheese, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo-avocado salsa. ��My husband ordered the Mole Poblano which is: braised pork, wood-grilled onions, crunchy garnishes, and fresh cheese. If you go on an empty stomach, make sure to order a side salad or their chips as my husband was somewhat hungry he left. ��This is definitely a place I would crave on a regular basis. ��Can't wait to try out the rest of their menu."
"I met a friend here for brunch on a rainy Sunday. We got there right at 10a.m., so there wasn't much of a wait. We got a seat by the window where you could see all of Michigan Ave while you dined. The service was decent and the food was a derivative of an upscale Cheesecake Factory, but still good. Generous portions and lots of flavor. All in all, a good experience and pretty affordable. I do think their drinks were a little too pricey, but then against most places down on Michigan Ave are. I had the Spanish Rose (champagne and Sangria) and it was wonderful!"
"I dined here with a friend over the weekend and was really disappointed. ��The food as OK, but the prices for what was served is ridiculous. ��I spent $45 for a stuffed pepper and one crab cake (split an appetizer order with a friend) on just myself. ��That doesn't include any drinks other than water. ��I left hungry still and certainly wasn't going to spend money on dessert at those prices. ��I have no problems spending money on a good meal but I should leave full and feel it was worth it!"
"One of the better rooftops in Chicago. I admit the view isn't great but what lacks in view they make up for in decor. The Sunday a-la-carte menu, mimosas, and bloody marys are awesome. The service is even better, especially Shanna. She makes the trip Zeds much more enjoyable. Thank you, Shanna!"
"I am a huge Rick Bayless fan, so it pains me to not give this place 5 stars.The overall dining experience was no fun. ?You have to wait in line and you can't order until a table has been assigned to you. ?Once you get a table assignment you order food, sit down, and wait for food delivery. It just seemed like a roundabout way of accomplishing the same task as a normal sit-down restaurant. Also, we did not have a private table -- my party of 2 was joined by a party of 4 at our six-seater table. ?The food was decent, but the prices were high, especially considering the portion sizes. ?The puny amount of salsa in the chips & salsa was so ridiculous that we laughed out loud. ?Seriously, it was a total joke! ?The chicken pozole soup was really good, but at $12 we felt it was overpriced. ?The to"
I'd never eaten good Indian food before so I went with a friend who lived there for a while. ��She was kind enough to order for me as she knew what I liked. ��Boy was it good. ��I'd eat Indian food anyday if it always tasted this good. ��They didn't have Kingfisher beer but the waiter suggested another that was very good. ��I'd recommend this place to anyone.
A nice setting with good food but severely over priced. ��I find the arrogance of ��the chef (Guy) and the owner (Omar) off putting. ��I'd pass!
"So many Juices! It's hard to pick just one--although I do have my favorites; banana, peach and strawberry. It's nice that all their juices are fresh too.The food is good--I love their breakfast menu. Everything is always cooked to perfection, no soggy eggs or raw bacon here."
Love this place..it's like my dream come true that thai girl living in Bangkok can eat at this place&met Rick whom I really like him from top chef..great food comes from lovable&caring persons
LOVE love LOVE this place. They mix my 2 favorite things... good beer and good pizza!Try the white pizza with goat cheese. and pretty much ANY of the beers they have on tap. (both their own brews or any of the ones hey have guest tapped) My boyfriend and I are total beer snobs so I am all about any place with a good tap list. Do yourself a favor and come here! perfect for both big groups of friends and dates!
"NeVER opens on time, people do have to get to work so when you decide to open at 8:10 in the morning rather than 8:00 it is annoying, no i will not leave you a tip fo that girls....then on top of it you give attitude to ME? because your late. hmmm wish there wa someplace better thats just as close, but then im kinda sick of paying $11.00 fir friggen oatmeal, coffe and scone, yep 11 buckaroos(thats without tip mindyou) OK this place give the SNUBS, the people that work there are ectomorphs with an attitude, most have been working there for years and still havent got the fact that it feels GOOD to be happy. ��My girlfriend has gone there with her 11 year old daughter and the ugly short haired girl at the counter sniggers at them, she thinks theyre a couple, as in gay lesbian couple. this has "
Is this place still open?
"If I could, I'd give this place a negative rating. I didn't even try the water, but based on the terrible treatment from merely walking in the door one Sunday morning to have brunch, starting with the discourteous treatment from the 'hostess', and then being escorted past literally dozens of empty tables, and some tables occupied by people similarly dressed to my friend and me, we were seated at the very back of the restaurant, with only one other occupied table even within view, and immediately next to the kitchen (which is not separated by any door or any other noise-muffling barrier). We sat to peruse the menu for just a minute before deciding to leave and go to a place which treats their patrons better."
"I friggen LOOOOVE this place. ��HOT HOT HOT staff, awesome service, plenty of booz and to top it off it has a GREAT unique twist on bar food.  I spend tons of time here. ��I can't help it...I'm in love with one of the waitresses!Oh yeah...I also wanted to add that one of the owners, PJ, is the sweetest ham I've met in Chicago in my 3 years here. ��GO LOCKDOWN! ��I'm IN!"
"I finally made it to Alinea! I have heard so much about Alinea but there is no way I could afford it. Surprise of all surprises: my boyfriend took me to Alinea for my birthday! It was a slice --or maybe I should say 18 courses-- of heaven! The decor was nice, but not trying too hard. Perfect. The service was wonderful but not suffocating. Perfect. The presentation of the food: AMAZING! Maybe I'm biased because I have dreamed of going here since I first read about it. The Hot Potato Cold Potato was MAGNIFICENT! The Black Truffle Explosion: TO DIE FOR! Great food, all of it. My BF said it was all right so that means he LOVED IT. If you are a world-class traveler, with fine taste you have probably already made this restaurant your Chicago headquarters but for the rest of us who have to work t"
best sushi place in edgewater! the thai is good the sushi is awesome! pretty well priced too! and this year they have a little outside seating area!!
Service was poor and the galbi was the old marinated meat and was very dry.
"My husband, myself, and another couple visited Frontera a few weeks ago. We typically enjoy finding restaurants of top chefs as we travel and sampling their culinary treats. We were warned to arrive early, as the doors open and are full immediately. We were very excited upon arrival to note that we'd get a table, and after waiting 45 minutes for the restaurant to open we did. My friend and I were chatting excitedly about sampling Bayless' food, but sadly, we were disappointed. From drinks, to completion, the meal was rather disappointing. The only 'star' of our meal was an appetizer sampler platter and guacamole and chips. Both were excellent. All the meals arrived at barely warm temperature. The food was good, but absolutely nothing about it wowed any of the four of us dining. There hones"
"I went here with a friend who was craving her favorite Grand Lux salad. I ordered the same thing and while the salad was okay, you can get much better for far less elsewhere. But so-so food aside, my lowly one-star rating is for the atmosphere... It sucks. It's loud and tacky and reminds me of a mall restaurant. The patrons are loud and tacky, too. Save your money, your heart and your sanity and go somewhere else."
"No meal this expensive is worth it. ?BUT, you are not going to eat here if you're looking for a good deal. ?you are going to eat here to have a unique IRON CHEF experience. ?i assure you, if that is your mentality, you will not be disappointed. ?ate here with my wife and we loved it."
"The food is hit-or-miss, and with great breakfast places in the city (sweet maple cafe, m henry, or big jones), there's no reason to ever hit this place up unless the environmental spin is important to you, and even then, there are better places in the city that provide local fare. Also, the customer service is decidedly lacking, but it seems to be more of a problem with management than the actual floorstaff. Upon being seated, we were given 3 menus to a party of six, and were told they'd try to find us some additional menus because they ""always run out of menus when the patio is full."" I'm not really uppity about these things, but I kind of wonder, if it's a persistent problem....why not print up more menus? Also, be warned that according to our server, it's against restaurant policy to s"
"I guess this falls under we didn't know what to expect, but it was a bit pricey for us and had a different twist of what we thought was cuban food. ��We also didn't know that is was BYOB, so were a bit dissapointed we couldn't have a drink with our meal. ��Not a terrible experience but not fantastic either."
"Good location to go to an event at the Harris Theater or the symphony. ��It's loud but if you can tolerate a consistently high noise level, the lively atmosphere is fun.We each ordered a burger. ��The gage upgrade hamburger was good, if just a touch over done for medium. ��The venison burger was terrific. ��Ordering the two and sharing highlighted that the kaiser roll for the hamburger was just a waste of space while the pretzel roll for the venison burger was tasty and the perfect texture. ��Flavor on the venison burger was great but it's a huge burger with all the toppings. ��Plenty of good fries on the side and nice pickles as a garnish. ��Scallop appetizer was pretty tasty. ��Bread served to the table had good flavor but dry and crunchy. ��Good service every time."
"I recently went back to Tru for the third time for a special occasion (anniversary). We wanted a truly special dining experience, and based on our previous two visits there when in Chicago, we thought this would be the place to go. I must say that I was disappointed. Compared with previous dinners there, the service seemed not as good as in the past and the menu was spare on fresh fish and vegetable choices. So while I would have rated them a 5 in the past, this time I can only give a 3.5. It is still a very good restaurant, but I don't think we will go back there. There are too many other outstanding places to try. I reserve a 5 star rating to mean that I recommend a place without any reservations at all and will certainly plan to return the next time I am in town."
"great food, great service. ��interesting dishes, and well plated."
"Worth the drive. ��I get the garlic and traditional sauce. ��The staff is friendly, the service is pretty good, and the pizza is perfect. ��I've never had a bad pizza from Piece."
"I have been going here since I was about six. The shakes are awesome, you can't beat their signature Super Dawg and the fries are delicious. If you are looking for a true Chicago dawg this is the place to go! Plus it gives you a taste of the past with their drive in service!"
"I live in the neighborhood, so I like the convenience. I love the food. i just wish that when I make a reservation for 9PM, I don't get my table until 10. They could work on that."
"I live down the block from Garcia's and was excited to have a nice sit down Mexican restaurant in the area that was fairly inexpensive. ��The first time I went I ordered the vegetable fajitas. ��As a non-meat eater I had always wanted to be able to experience the sizzling fajita presentation, but meatless options are rarely offered. ��I was extremely disappointed when a lukewarm plate of mushy vegetables was set down in front of me. ��I had it boxed and vowed to never return. ��Luckily the salsa was AMAZING and I was able to make a meal out of that.  ��The reason for the 4 stars you might ask? ��A friend wanted to meet there the other day and although I was skeptical, I did my due diligence on Yelp and it looked like the fish tacos were the way to go. ��They are. ��And at $2.50 a pop for a whole fi"
i love this venue. cheap champange and nostalgic decor.. ��get up close and personal with the music..
This is my favorite restaurant! ��The food is amazing. ��The only problem for me is that I have three kids and this is not a kid-friendly restaurant.
"I'm absolutely stunned on the high ratings Alinea is getting.I'll keep it short. If you like pretentious dinning at an obscene price, this is the place for you.If not, there's way better food at a much better price in Chicago."
I really like this place the food is always good and so is the service! Best Indian Buffet in town. ��I love the curry.
"My partner and I used to love this place but with the recent decor and menu change, the place is somehow less appealing. The restaurant put a good amount of money into redoing the interior, new chairs, tables, wall murals etc but now it just feels off. Guess I don't like change. The food is the same but the prices have gone up reflecting the overall upgrade of the restaurant."
"I can't seem to eat at Hot Doug's. ��I came at 4:00 pm for an early dinner once, but they were closing. ��I can't stand in a long line with small children, I I probably wouldn't anyway, ��so I guess this restaurant is out for me."
"While I really wanted to give this place the maximum rating, the ill-trained wait staff nearly ruined the entire evening. ��To wit, we had a large group set ��for an 830 reservation. ��Once we arrived, we were told that we would have to wait until 9 because the party ahead of us was taking longer than anticipated. ��No biggie, March Madness was on. ��At 9pm we again check to see if our table is ready and once again we were told that the party ahead of us was slow and that we woulld be seated at 930. ��Gotcha. ��It's Saturday night so I somewhat understand that these types of issues are bound to arise. ��At this point, I'm still OK. ��Hungry and penniless from my foolish toruney picks, but ultimately OK. �� ��Once we were finally seated things were moving along A-OK until it came time to serve our ent"
"Ive been eating here for 2 years now, and I've moved on from vegetarian fare, to vegan fare, & now to RAW vegan fare! yesss, I've evolved! haha. loving the raw vegan options, seems to grow/change every time i stop by. absolutely LOVE their raw vegan desserts!!! yummy & guilt free! gotta give the raw vegan fare a try ! thing is, it ain't too cheap :c"
"Great place. ��The chicken is great, and the cheapest somewhat healthy fast food meal in the area. 1/4 chicken, 2 sides, pita and drink for $6 (with tax). ��Unbielievable. ��I will say that the quality is somewhat inconsistent when their are busy, but that is the case at a lot of places.There pizza is AWESOME. ��The staff is very nice.Go here, support the great family run buisiness"
"Fantastic margaritas, solid food, and a restaurant that has never been too crowded to get us sat quickly. ��Our new favorite in Lincoln Park."
I grew up in pilsen and have been going to Nuevo Leon for years. Not all the food is 100% great. I personally love the breakfast items like the huevos rancheros or the huevos divorciados ( 2 eggs over easy one with green sauce on with red sauce accompanied by chilaquiles) not on the menu but ask for it!! I also like to get the caldo de res( beef stew) It's made fresh on Saturdays and is ready by 10:00 AM I hate a crowd so i usually go at 9:30 the crowd starts pouring in at about 11:00. My husband and I enjoy the BYOB option as well.
"Love this place, best food ever !!!!!!"
I've had better. There are way better restaurants in Pilsen. I've heard this restaurant reccomened by many people and the place is always crowded. I was just not impressed when I actually ate the food. The food was too greasy and overall it was just plain meh! I do enjoy mexican food just not from this place. I dont see what the fuss is all about.
I would suggest Hot Doug's to anybody and love the creativity and quality of the menu and the personality of Doug while taking your order. ��It is a unique place that everybody should try at least once. ��But there are a lot of places in this city where you can get a great hot dog and some of the sausages I've tried have been great or just ok. ��I thought this would be a place I would go to as often as I could but have found myself sometimes passing it by for other options. ��Definitely try it out and see for yourself.
"Excellent! The sushi was fab, and this chicken plate i had was sooo good, I almost ate the plate.. The service was eh..didnt pay attention to them because the food was great.. Not to pricey... it nice to go with groups or on a date..did i mention the food is great?2 Thumbs up! Cant wait to go back"
"The decor is very nice and classy, but the place is very noisy, and the food is mediocre and overpriced. I don't think Sunda deserved the four star average on yelp. I usually agree with most yelp restaurant reviews, but not this one."
"Had personal stuffed pizzas due to time constraints and loved them. ��The 1 topping pizzas came pre-made and took 15 mins compared to the larger size which take 45 mins. ��Had limited time and were in/out in 45 mins. ��Great pizza, great atmosphere, quick...wonderful lunch experience. ��Discovered through Yelp app and didn't disappoint."
"One of the best meals I have had! Mastro's continues to impress and dish up the best steak I have had in the Chicago area. The bar is rather cramped and its hard to get a drink so make sure you have a reservation or you go at an off hour. But all in all, it was worth 30 minute the wait! So glad Mastro's finally made an appearance in the Windy City!"
"I was in Chicago on a fun mini-holiday. ��My party really wanted to go to Frontera, especially since they just won the James Beard award. ��However, it was a Sunday night and Frontera was closed. ��We were pretty bummed and we were at a loss about where to eat (since none of us were from Chicago).We wondered down the street and were standing in front of a parking lot with a sign for India House. ��We thought Indian food would be the perfect way to end our Chicago holiday. ��Boy, we were right.Not only did we love India House, we're really glad that Frontera was closed or else we would have never selected India House that night.The food was terrific and the menu offers something for everyone. ��From samosas to tandoori to a great beer/wine list, we loved every minute of our meal. ��Thank you India"
"This is the best of the Big 3 Brazilian steakhouses in Chicago. However, you need to make sure they apply any promotions you use (e.g. - restaurant week, 50% off, etc.). On three separate occasions they forgot to apply the promotions I presented."
"Good enough for a neighborhood sushi place. ��Most likely I'll try to reserve Wakamono for take-out going forward given the attitude of the ""host"" on duty last Friday night when I went with friends. �� It may be helpful for the manager to look up the word ""host"" before placing a rigid, stern unwelcoming, unsmiling miserable employee at the host stand. ��To top it off, after waiting 50 minutes in the bar, we had to ask about our table which was evidently ready 5 minutes prior. ��Really? ��Oh, and if customers come up and ask if there is place to hang a coat and you're the ""host"" doing absolutely nothing, take the coat and hang it up. If you've tried their sister restaurant across the street, Ping Pong, you know what a bad host looks like. ��C'mon people, it's called a service industry for a reaso"
"Well, it seems like the Hopleaf just doesn't do it for me anymore. That last time I was there they didn't have a single fruit beer on draft, and what's with the crowd they draw these days? It's like Wicker Park north. It seems like the food has gotten steadily better, and is now actually very good, except they never adequately season the mussels, or put enough cream or ale in them. The mussels themselves are good, they just aren't dressed up for the big time.Hopefully someday Wicker Park will go back to the other side of the Kennedy and leave us the Hopleaf we knew once upon a time."
"Dont book this place for a group.We reserved a private room for 20 people.As part of the contract we had the restaurant include our meal as well as unlimited drinks from the bar for 3 hours. After an hour and a half the 20 of us had only been served a total of 43 drinks and were cut off for being disruptive and 'overserved'. ?The problem was we were then charged for not meeting our minium bar tab, the manger at the time felt the need to come in and and be agressive to us all for no reason. When we asked about this policy wer were asked to leave the restaurant. Food was ok, there was only 1 server for the 20 of us who also doubles as the bus boy. Although he worked very hard the service provided by the rest of the staff was as poor as I have received. In a city with so many other options, d"
Cory approved.
"This is a regular place of mine to take clients for a business lunch. The service is speedy, but not pushy about it. The food ranges from a great burger to filet mignon. Very versatile, something for everyone. I highly recommend their great martinis (that is if the boss doesn't mind) they're delicious!"
"Best Thai food in the city. I get it to go all of the time. It is enough to two easily. Combination fried rice and crab rangoon, OMG, so Yum, Yum, Yummy. A warning...the very hot will burn your mouth. I love spicy foods, so no worries here, but just want to warn you."
"Amazing pizza. I love this place so much. I have taken friends, family, out of town visitors...and it is always delicious. It never disappoints. Also, the owner of the restaurant is often kind enough to hand out free samples of ��this or that while you wait. When my mother came from out of town he treated us both to a sweet limoncello. Also, when I once spilled an ENTIRE glass of red wine on my favorite jeans the waiter was more remorseful than the guy I had come with. He immediately brought me towels and a stain stick. The stick was a bit small for the stain (which we had a good laugh about)...but I used it anyway and the whole thing came out in the wash. I agree with others here that the pizza is the real deal. And I'm sorry but, it sure helps to have a great waitstaff as well..."
Four years ago my hairdresser recommended this place for a first date and I have become a regular since then. Once a month I'm in here eating Pho Ga (chicken noodle soup) and lemon grass beef. The owner Tuang and his staff are incredibly attentive. The portions are perfect and I cannot stress enough how fresh the ingredients are. I enjoy the BYOB option and while they are super busy on Saturday nights the service never suffers. ��There is free parking at oz park which is half a block away.....I love simply it place so much I told you my secret parking spot so you can try it out. ��It's my favorite restaurant in Chicago.
"I never write reviews but my horrible experience at this place brought me here. ��To start off the over eager waiter literally read the entire menu to us, which took over 15 minutes. ��I'm pretty sure last time I checked we were all very capable of reading on our own. ��Specials would have been just fine. ��Then when we needed a minute to look at the menu and actually read it for ourselves he came back 20 seconds later twice to ask if we needed a minute. ��If he hadn't read the menu to us we would have been ordered and had our food already. ��Then when it came to get the check and get out of there so we could make the show we were going to see he was no where in site. ��To make things worse my girlfriend became extremely sick not long after eating there. ��At first we didn't think there was anyway"
"The best Italian food for over 30 years......My parents took us there as children and I now I take my children there........Food Is excellent !!!!!!!!!!!!!1 Think Mario has been our family waiter for the past 30 years,,,,,,,, Over all I feel its one of Chicago's best kept secerts.........Great ��Food / great service / same wonderful owners / Great Value for the money........For DESSERT......The Baked Alaska is a must........ This is a 10 star resturant..................."
"First off, I consider myself somewhat of a Greek Foodie Connoisseur...and with good reason, as I've been to the real islands multiple times, as well as the best restaurants throughout the country.I went here on a busy Saturday night. First impression of this place was that it was very big and bustling...however, the table I was seated at did have room (I was with one other person). The second thing I noticed was the smell...there was a permeating odor of strong, musty....foot...seriously though, it was bad. The wait staff was very impatient and pressed to get our order.The bread they put on the table was ice cold, and I got the impression that it was reused...They forgot to bring napkins throughout our whole meal (they weren't even on the table).We ordered the Athenian salad (a Greek stapl"
"If u wanna have a horrible nite tonite, head out to Sunda. They won't seat u even with a reservation. If u arrive 10min early, they make sure u wait that 10min before they break the news to u. Bcaz they r so thoughtful, u'll b offered a coat check during this process. A great spot to see discrimination against ppl with kids n disability. Thinking abt calling ahead? Don't worry, u'll b so misinformed it's ��beyond belief. The waitress/host are carefully selected to get the top bi*ches in Chicagoland area. Overall, a great place to try if u got extra time to waste. And this entire experience is offered to you at no cost, absolutely free!!"
"Heavenly! I love Mia Francesca. Easily the best pasta I've ever had, and I'm not a big pasta eater. The fresh bread with the basil olive oil starts my dinner off right every time, and the food along with the atmosphere is always excellent. I agree with a previous reviewer who said it gets pretty crowded, but that's how you know it's good!"
"Good food but average service. The wait was long and I felt they could have done a better job of letting us know that its ��going to take time. If you have guests or a larger group with you , you may want to consider a place with less wait and better service. Overall an okay experience, well priced."
"I just wanted to say thanks to Maura (I hope I spelled it right) and everybody else who collaborated on Sun. night to make my first visit to the Violet Hour a super great one. I was in town visiting from Denver and have been wanting to go get a drink here for a long time. Unfortunately my friend and I arrived just a little too late and almost weren't allowed in, I whined about being there all the way from Colorado and luckily we got in. (Thank you floor manager & hostess for being cool). I started talking to Maura about bartending and drinks in general and she was so kind and made me a Juliet and Romeo. (even though we had originally been told it was too late for anything other than a beer and/or shot) Super delicious, I loved it. Wish I could be there more often to try out more drinks, th"
"Ok so after 2 years of not wanting to like you, i gave you a shot. dined here the other day for my birthday dinner (my first time but many others in party had been) with 11 others in our party. We were seated right away- 12 ppl for a reservation at 8:30 on a sat- i was shocked! our waiter was great, even in a place with so many people and it being so loud, she was really patient and attentive the entire evening. since we had a large group we were able to try many ��dishes. a few standouts were the rockshrimp, tale of two tunas, crispy rice with tuna, no you didnt handroll... we tried a bunch of other things but those i remember well. I also drank about 3 or 4 of peared sakes---- they were amazing. would have thought they were kool aid the way i took them down. overall everyone in our party "
"We went there this past Friday night (6/15/12) with a $20 voucher from Living Social, which was enough to cover the cost of one of our entrees. This place is only a few blocks from home, and we've been wanting to try it for some time. As soon as we walked in, we experienced the wonderful aromas of all the delicious foods being prepared in the kitchen. The waitstaff was friendly enough, although it seemed as though every waitress in the building was taking turns at our table, probably because there were only a few other patrons dining at the time. The food was delicious -we had the Braised Short Rib Goulash & the Pork Schnitzel- but the servings were a bit too conservative for the price, in my opinion. Perhaps I've been spoiled by large Western portions my entire life, but if I'm laying out"
"Ohh ZED...how I love you. ��This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city and every time we go back, it just gets better. ��They frequently change their offerings (as well as their cocktail menu...kumquat mule, anybody?!) and I always leave full and very satisfied. ��Services is always top-notch, as is the food, and the sauces they serve with the meat/fish offerings...you must try them. ��I also don't think ZED gets enough credit for their brunch - Orange is right across the street and I'm telling you, for a great price ($24/person) skip the line and head over to ZED. ��You get a GREAT brunch complete with large skillets of cinnamon rolls, and tons of other great eats.I recently also tried the butterscotch bread pudding dessert...holy yum. ��I love this place. ��If you haven't been,"
"I just moved into the neighborhood recently from Edgewater. While Edgewater has Argyle, Lincoln Park has Simply It! When I first moved, I was scared of not being able to find a place to dine that didn't put a hole in my wallet and was still up to Argyle standards.However, this place is much, much better than Argyle! Not only is it much cleaner and appealing in decor, but the food is nicely prepared. Their food also tastes like tangible heaven. I stopped by for lunch and enjoyed a nice table by the window. Although the weather wasn't looking too great this week, I was able to warm up with their soup and enjoy their appetizers.I'm definitely looking forward to coming by more often!"
"good burger, I did not eat the burger so good in Chicago, good salads, cook ,5 stars, 2 stars for the waiter to bad for my"
This is a good option for a steak and potato meal. ��They have great cuts of meat and good potatoes as a side. ��I also really like their salads so sometimes when I don't feel like a big steak meal I get a salad and am perfectly happy!
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I think Hot Doug's BEATS Portillo's. Now that's worth a visit..I'm sorry it took me so long to get there!"
"I was skeptical because we went during Restaurant Week.... However I could not have asked for a better experience! The staff was very attentive and polite! They constantly asked us if we needed anything or if we had any special request throughout the night. The food...The Salad Bar options at Texas exceeded my expectations as I have been to Fogo De Chao and was not impressed at all. ��I went around Texas' salad bar least 3 times just to make sure I had everything I wanted to try! :-) ��The Meat service was great! Again, because it was restaurant week I was fearful we would be overlooked and not have the opportunity to try everything we wanted.... I was wrong! As soon as we turned our cards over to green ��the servers catered to us, coming by several times throughout the night with every offer"
"Welcome to http://match.com central. Or maybe its eharmony central. hard to tell. But its all 2-top tables and pairs of singles getting to know themselves over very fine but small portions of miso soup. Still, we had a super-attentive waiter who knew all about the food so that was nice, and it was delish. Dragon roll rocks."
"Great place! I came in with my parents just last night on a very busy friday without any reservations. We were asked to wait in the juice bar for 15 minutes before we were seated. It was probably one of the best waits I've ever had. We were given little appetizers to hold us off while we waited for our table. I've never had any other restaurant do that for me! I found it very nice of this small family ran business.Once we were seated our waters came out, we already knew what we wanted to order and gave the waiter our order. Our food came out only 8 minutes later! We proceeded to eat and enjoy our dinner with service checking up on us. I only took off one star because the portion of my King Crab Pasta didn't seem to be large enough for me. Otherwise everything else seems to have been a grea"
"this place has been there for 40 plus years...i've been going since i was born, twentysomething of those years. it's not there because the food is ��no good, thats for sure...the food is delicious!!! i have an inside secret for you all...theres a dish thats not on the menu, but if you order you wont be disappointed...name of it...machito...huge piece of steak w/ an enchilada,and lots more food on that plate...all for bout 15 bucks...trust me on this one! anyone who says this food is inedible should probably stay at home reheating leftover chalupas or nachos grandes!!! you wont find better mexican food than this... well maybe in my mamas kitchen!"
"Went for our 15th anniversary, had ressies for 8, showed up at 7, checked in and had a drink and apps at the bar, Bartender was AWESOME!!!!! Oysters were very fresh and shucked well, only MINOR quibble, were not told what the individual oysters were. Were seated promptly at 8, had a wonderful time, stone crab claws were sweet and delish, had a lovely Argyle Pinot, my hubby the red grouper, he devoured it, was tasty! I had the grilled halibut, was outstanding!! English peas, pearl onions, bacon and a YUMMY pea broth, that had a nice lemony flavor, also had an order of broccoli with a cheddar/Brie sauce! WOW! The best. We wanted dessert, but still had some nice wine to enjoy and we were both satisfied. Our server Jean(sp?) was a great server! She was attentive and not invasive and very frien"
"I've been going to La Villa for about 6 years. I think its really good. I absolutely love the Oysters Rockerfeller. Im also a fan of the Shrimp DeJaughn (spelling?). As far as entrees go, my favorites are the Fettucini Alfredo with Chicken and Chicken Parmesan. The pizza is pretty good. I cant comment on the salad bar because Ive never tried it but everytime Ive been there it seemed to be a hot spot. The waitstaff is very attentive, especially the happy waitress...Lydia, I believe? Shes a riot. Good food, great service."
"First-ever authentic Chicago deep-dish, and was very pleased. ��I've had Pizzeria Uno's (the chain version, not the Chicago original) and never liked it, and this beat that out of the park.My only reasons for not going five-star were the wait and the amount of food. ��The wait was expected, as this is the top-rated pizza joint in Chicago, but any longer than our hour and fifteen minute wait would've had me walking away, and that didn't include the fifteen or so minutes' wait after we got to the table (in spite of pre-ordering our pizza). ��That said, the staff was very friendly and prompt about getting to us and getting our drinks.Giordano's is definitely affordable, but the amount of food can be a bit deceiving - we ordered the smallest pie available that wasn't personal, and between two peo"
"The service is hit or miss for me - sometimes the staff is attentive, sometimes I'd rather get up and do everything myself. ��The people at the host stand have NEVER once been polite or friendly, in fact, they're often snooty. ��(That's why they get 3 stars instead of 5)What they lack in service, they make up for with their menu. ��Food always tastes amazing, my favorite is the Spicy Miso Soup. ��They have a wonderful selection of specialty rolls as well."
"Mediocre food, terrible service! About 3 weeks ago, my boyfriend and I took our friends from Spain to Wakamon for dinner, what we thought was one of the best places in Lakeview for sushi. Best place for Sushi?!!..maybe not, for the following reasons: 1. We were told the wait was 45 minutes, we finally got sat 2 hours later. The response from the nice host, ""I'm really sorry for the wait, we will seat you as soon as possible,"" Response from unprofessional host, ""I'm not sorry, it's a Friday night we're busy, all these people are waiting just as long as you."" 2. One of the wait staff spilled wine on one of our friends from Spain....Red Wine! And no offer to pay dry cleaning. 3. Waitress was unfriendly 4. $8 Corkage fee...our $7 bottle of wine (probably shouldn't admit that)just turned into a"
good drinks
"We had an excellent dinner at Shaw's. We told our waitress we had a 7:45 reservation for a sunset cruise, and she had us fed and outta there in perfect time. Further, she answered all our questions honestly and knowledgeably and recommended a perfect white wine for our dinner. The crab cake was moist and succulent with tons of crab and an excellent remoulade on the side. Great service, great food, great restaurant. I actually wrote home about it!"
All the reviews are true. I need not repeat them. Best restaurant in Chicago.
"I love the atmosphere of this restaurant, its a great place to have a glass of wine and just relax and enjoy. ��Love the trio steak thing."
"Pizza is great, but in Chicago, many pizza's are great. ��So when it comes to the difference between pizza places, service is one of the important factors to separate each place. ��Service here is A-Ok but nothing more, they miss a lot of things and also mix things up by bringing wrong drinks to the table, or wrong checks, or regular coke when it should have been diet coke, things like that, no biggie. ��the last few times here it happened too many times, not complaining, just weird that it happens so much. ��the food is great though, and you will go back, you just deal with the mishap service; it's funny after a while. and for sure, i could use a few laughs, �� I will be back again."
"Lovely dinner last night, if a little pricey. Friendly and attentive service. Delicious calamari. Fresh tasty salads. Would like to see a more abundant antepasto bar. The desserts were absolutely delicious."
"My daughter and I had the pleasure of dining here tonight. We each started with the beet soup and it was simply outstanding. She had the skirt steak and I the pork schnitzel. We tried each others dinners and agreed that they were both very, very good. The desserts were absolutely perfect after the fabulous meal and we decided that we will definitely be back, The staff made us feel very welcome and at home. They were professional and friendly. A bit of a ride for us but well worth the drive on all counts."
"There's nothing I can say about this place that hasn't already been said. ��Quite possibly the only place in the city I'll wait in line! ��We tend to over indulge (if you're going to wait an hour, you have to order more than one dog....). ��And while we're enjoying the cholesterol fest, thrown in an order or two of duck fat fries.....why not! ��I've worked my way through the menu, and have yet to be disappointed. ��This is the ultimate hot dog: ��worth every single calorie, and every single minute in line!"
"Went on recommendation of hotel staff. ��One of my friends also saw it on food network. ��We let the waitress order all our food and pick our wine, and it was so delicious. ��Wish I lived in Chicago so I could go back. ��I recommend to anyone visiting. ��Very unique food with great atmosphere and friendly staff."
"I had a good meal here recently, but i'm not sure it deserves four stars.1. ��They only offer 3 salads, which is really weak. ��The mixed greens, however, was pretty darn good; though my friend thought the dressing was way too tart.2. ��The pizza takes a long time, but it's good.3. ��I tried 2 of their beers and didn't care for either one. ��With the explosion of craft beers, it's easy for the good to stand out from the not-so-good.Decent overall. ��I'd go back; but wouldn't go out of my way."
"I love this place! I went with a couple friends after yoga at Ruby Room, which is just a couple blocks down, and YUM. The french toast is among the best I've ever had. Terrific coffee. We did have to wait (brunch on a Sunday, of course there's a wait everywhere you go!) - but it wasn't exceptionally long. Chill out, enjoy the people watching, and relaxxx. Everyone was pretty cozily hanging out by the bar, patiently waiting their turn and enjoying the coffee. The crowd was mellow and the staff was super friendly. This is going to be a regular spot for me, for sure. Fabulous easygoing vibe."
"Best Pho I've ever had. Owner is amazing (first time in the restaurant, he gives you a free app) and the service is outstanding! They go above and beyond... you even get fruit for dessert on the house at the end of your meal and when you order take out. Very affordable"
"After the first visit I was hooked, and have returned twice more.Very good food, served well by friendly staff, in very pleasant surroundings. The wait staff visits often enough to take care of your needs but does not hover or smother. One of the family owners visit each table to be sure all is well. Excellent ingredients are prepared and served in imaginative ways. Each dish tasting as the best it can possibly be."
"I had been a vegitarian for four years and a vegan for two of those years when I fist ate at Chicago diner. ��I reeeeeaaaally wanted to like it but it pretty much tasted like the inside of a fryer. ��Thier secret recipe is basically stiking anything in the deep fryer and adding salt. ��Vegitarian or not, the food is terrible. ��I went back several times because I wanted to find something redeeming....but everytime, no matter what the dish it was the same thing. ��The only thing that was worth getting was the vegan milk shakes....but most of you can just skip the vegan and go to your local greasy spoon to get the real deal."
My friend took me and my sister here during the summer after the gym. The waiting is horrendous. We waited almost an hour for a table. The duck and duck sauce was delicious. Some dishes were good and some were not. I doubt I will be going back to Sun Wah anytime soon.
I had never been to this restaurant before and absolutely LOVED it! ��The ambiance is great and has a good vibe with the latin music playing. ��The service was very attentive and the food was outstanding! ��Very reasonably priced and nice menu selection! ��I was very impressed and will definitely go back soon.
"Great date spot. Bit pricey but you get what you pay for. My only issue was when I made a reservation I had mentioned it was a special occasion and then was seat in the middle at a small table about 6 inches from the table next to us making the atmosphere far from romantic as it felt as we were sitting with the group next to us. I asked for a new table and was quickly and friendly accommodated and move to a booth. Great food, service and atmosphere. Fantastic wine list."
"Great atmosphere, even better food."
"I took my daughter and 30 friends and family to the Grand Lux Cafe for her high school graduation. ��We waited two and a half hours just to be seated (there was no place to sit, so we stood outside). ��Then once we place our order, we waited another hour before our food actually came. ��I could have gotten what they served from a neighborhood restaurant - the food was not worth the price we paid for it and everyone in my party agreed. ��It was so bad that I agreed to pay for everyones bill - I was that embarassed. ��Needless to say, I've never been back, nor do I ever plan to patronize this establishment again. ��It's just not worth the wait. ��There are too may exquisite restaurants in Chicago that HAVE reservations and high qualiity food that I don't have to waste my time having a horrible expe"
"Love the scene. Cabbage salad is great, sushi spectacular."
THE worst management!!!!!! Avoid this place at all costs!!!!!
"So it gets another star with the update. ��We were up early this past weekend, and decided to give it one more try since we could beat the rush. ��The service was very quick and kind, however the food was incredibly bland. ��Generous portions, too generous. ��My husband hated his benedict, and my entree was blah. ��Tables were close together, there was only one stall in the bathroom, and the coffee service was a bit sluggish. ��Nice marketing and fresh food, but I feel no need to return."
I come here almost every week and am never disappointed! The servers are exceptionally kind and helpful when I don't know what to get. I get the Salmon and broccoli whenever I am looking for happiness on a plate. ��Thank you Kinzie for rocking!
"Come bid on a TRU Restaurant VIP Tour! http://www.cbhconline.or��_Bidding ends June 17, 2011."
"We went here for a specila occassion, my 40th birthday and everyone loved it. The meal was excellent. We started with a garbage sald that had a tangy delicious dressing. I also ordered a green apple martini that was very good. I ordered the macadamian nut crusted halibut that was the best I ever had. I LOVED the dessert tray. The waitress comes around with the tray and shows yopu all the desserts. It was definitely hard to choose. It was well worth the price. There wasn't a single thing we didn't like about this restaurant."
I like Brazzaz! I have wanted to go for a long time because I went to a NYC restaurant with this style of food many years ago. It was great then and I enjoyed Brazzaz just as much. I was familiar with the concept so I lightly grazed the salad bar. I was saving room for the meat and it just kept coming. Wine by the glass was a good selection to go with all this meat. The service was good to excellent. I felt the lay out of the tables were ok and the food to be fresh. I just got a 1/2 price coupon for this place. It will definitely be used over the summer. I have not been to any of the other Chicago style restaurants with this concept. I found Brazzaz to be more than adequate
"I came here for my birthday dinner last month and had a great time. ��The food was amazing - my girlfriend and I shared the CB&J and Duck Reuben and were in heaven the whole meal. ��I also sniped some delicious mussels from my friend's plate. ��We sat near the entrance, where it gets very crowded and you have to order at the bar (it can be a bit inconvenient weaving through the crowds, especially after a couple of strong beers), but overall the scene and service seemed about on par with most bars.We definitely came for the beer though. ��Seriously, they have a selection worth getting excited about - I even slacked off a bit at work that day and devised an ordered list of beers to try during the evening. ��My embarrassing admission is that I didn't make it all the way through my list, but suffic"
"The table we were seated on was really cramped, we were literally elbowing the people seated next to us. The food was decent but the waiter seemed to have a major attitude problem. He took an obnoxiously long time to come to our table and when he did come he was in a hurry. Food is plausible but service is horrible. I would not recommend this place at all, try Gayloard instead."
I love this place. The atmosphere is great and the service has always been great. They can get really busy so sometimes you will have a wait. But they will open your wine for you and you can drink it while you wait. The white dragon is by far the best. I highly recommend trying Coast!
Being new to the city I am having fun trying out all the restaurants in walking distance to my new apartment. ��This is a good Greek restaurant. Good food and atmosphere. I'm going down the street to try out the Parthenon restaurant next weekend.
"Not good, pretty bad, avoid at all cost."
"In the past 5 years, I have attended Kinzie Chophouse for a wide variety of reasons and celebrations, including a business lunch with a client, after work happy hour with friends and even celebrating my 30th birthday with all of my out-of-town family members. ��The main ingredient that each and every visit to Kinzie Chophouse consistently incorporates is a supreme dining experience through quality food and exceptional service. ��From the minute the Kinzie guest is seated at a table to the moment of exit, the service is impeccable. ��My absolute favorite menu option is the calamari. ��My fiancee and I order fried calamari every time we see it on a menu, and we both agree that Kinzie Chophouse offers the finest calamari in the city. ��Kinzie's recipe incorporates a perfect balance with a hearty p"
"Indian food this good is hard to come by. Nan, tandoori?? Delicious! Took my gf here and she is pretty picky about certain types of cuisine. I though i would have a hard time getting her to appreciate indian food, but not with this place...the food was hot, fresh and delicious. Staff was friendly and very accommodating...definitely coming back and bringing her again. it's always nice to turn someone on to something new and find out they actually enjoy it just as much as you do."
"So, it's nearly impossible for me to write a completely terrible review of Ruth's Chris, considering how delicious the food is. ��However, I want to say that on one occasion I was there with a few friends, we had ordered some appetizers. ��Upon taking my first bite I bit down on something hard... it was a piece of glass! As I took the piece of glass out of my mouth I noticed blood coming from the roof of my mouth. ��I showed the manager (who could clearly see blood on my hand) and showed him the chip of glass. ��He went on and apologized uncontrollably and took care of my table's service the rest of the night. ��When we were finished with our steaks (which were perfect) we received a bill which had ZERO dollars taken off of it. ��I'm not one to try and get free meals, but this was just ridiculou"
"I am always amazed that Nuevo Leon has such a strong following. As a lifelong Mexican Food aficionado, IMHO the food at NL is not just bad, it is horrible. There are no redeeming qualities to this restaurant. I believe that it is successful because many are unfamiliar with real Mexican food and/or have such low expectations of Mexican restaurants. Every couple of years, I am compelled to give Nuevo Leon another try because so many folks rave about the place. Yet, on my last visit, a bland tasteless salsa was brought out (we even witnessed salsa, after a customer left, being put back by the waiter into a large bowl, only to be scooped up again to be served anew; yuck!), the chips were soggy, greasy and tasteless, and there was an energizer battery in the soup (yes, this happened to us!). No"
"I am a frequent patron of Icosium Kafe. ��It goes without saying that the food is fantastic - read any of the other reviews to confirm that (my favorite is the Chicago crepe- and the vegetable soup is the best I've ever tasted). ��But what really keeps me coming back to this restaurant time and time again is the service. ��The staff is small, so over time the faces become familiar, and I am immediately greeted when I come into the restaurant. ��I feel like I'm eating with family.So imagine my surprise on Saturday morning when my meal was interrupted with shouting and swearing. ��I looked up to see what I assume was a manager, feet away from my table and in plain view of the entire restaurant, yelling in my server and swearing at her. ��He was accusing her of neglecting her tables. ��I can't speak"
Italian small plates. Cacio e pepe and ��Pizza dela Terre were amazing!! I am still craving for it. Very simple dishes yet extremely tasty. Will definitely be back.
"This is my new favorite. Its inexpensive ($8-12 per person) and BYOB. Right accross the street from the Western brownline stop, so convenient location. I order the Peanut Lovers with Chicken with mild spices. it was awesome. Large servings and was enough for an entire meal the next day. Service was average nothing to brag about. Decor was nice."
"This place isn't terrible. I know everything in Andersonville is automatically cool but I've been there twice now (breakfast on a weekday and Sunday brunch) and it just isn't all that great. Yes it's different. Everything on the menu looks great but it seemed my food was lacking in execution both times. They should learn to prepare greens properly or stop serving them. They aren't a salad and shouldn't be treated as such. I would say the food was more like someone who visited the south and then tried to make food like it. I ordered the ""country breakfast"" just to sample several things and it seemed like everything came out rushed. Eggs weren't quite done (I like over easy but hey..) and the greens were not cooked enough.The country ham was excellent though. I like the idea and I'd go back "
"amazing food. I love the salad bar. Awesome hummus. Pita bread is great. Quick, efficient, good service. Quiet, clean . . . great place to come in for a quick bite."
I was very unhappy with the food! I went to Garcias 5 years ago and was expecting a ��more authentic look and feel to the place but it was like eating at a late night burrito place. I DID NOT LIKE THE CHEAPGUAC. THE VEGGIES AND CHICKEN WAS VERY BAD! LACKED FLAVOR. WILL NEVER GO BACK!
"Love, Love, Love the Green Mill. ��Love the ambiance, the music (thursday night big ban jazz), the doorman (Al). ��THe only isue is it gets crowded, but hey, when it's good, it's good."
"Went here for dinner on an early weeknight, and we were totally impressed. From service to food to saying goodnight, everything was fantastic. Little Bucharest Bistro is a great place for date nights but it has a great family vibe as well! I loved the Saganaki for appetizers, Gnocchi for entree with braised short ribs, the meat was cooked more than perfectly, it just fell right apart; amazing! And for desert apricot crepes! The owner Branko is good enough reason just to go and chat about their place, very nice family. I suggest it!"
"This place is not high cuisine but its still great in my book. The food is great, the servings are huge, and price is fairly reasonable. Suggestion: Try to mole dishes they are very good."
"I was expecting amazing and to say it fell short was an understatement. ��There are so many great places in Chicago why settle for poor service.We had a really early reservation, and of course, in typical fashion, you can't sit until your party is there - even though the restaurant was completely empty due to the early weekday time and there were no seats at the bar - ok, not accomodating but their policy, I'll let that one pass / get over it.We sit down and order drinks. ��They come out correctly. ��My friend tries her drink, decides she doesn't like it, and orders another one. ��We weren't expecting it free - it was a mistake on our end. ��But the waitress removed the first drink with a huge attitude and without asking us (at which point we wrongly assumed they were being accomodating) and br"
It wasn't bad and our server was nice but a little slow although the bus people were very efficient. We were told that the plates are small plates so we ordered two extra dishes to compensate. However the when dishes arrived we realized that there was too much food. The plates were small for Italian dishes but they were the perfect size entree...not too much or too little. I thought they were regular sized entrees for anywhere else in the world except in America. They wine choices and chocolate mousse was excellent.
"Worst service ever. They kicked me and my boyfriend out of our table because they had a ""VIP"" coming through. This place will be closed in a year. If theyre lucky!"
"Grand Lux Cafe is a fabulous restaurant if you want to dress up, feel lavish, and dine with family/friends/coworkers within a moderate budget. The menu and the ambiance is very similar to the Cheesecake Factory, so it ensures that customers will have a very good time.I do have one warning: If you wear shoes without a grip that can cause you to slide or break your neck, you might not want to wear them there. ��The tile floors in the restaurant are very very slippery. Wearing heels, I was very happy to have a stair rail and a friend to hold on to."
"The Vegan Milkshakes are a MUST HAVE! Vegan or Vegetarian, it doesn't matter. You'll fall in love!P.S.I met Ke$ha here too! She tried some of my milkshake (true story)"
"I have a complain first of all, it's always so busy! Seriously you have to wait so long just to get a table, food is usually good but the waiters are always in such a hurry and you can barely make any requests.The inside of the restaurant is very nice and huge, it's very affordable too and you can't beat the neighborhood!"
"Wow... this place reminds me of a college party in the dean's study! Amazing decor; walls and walls of books, complete with fireplace and leather armchairs. Pair that with the amazing dance music and some killer sandwiches (mmm pretzel bun) and you got yourself a very enjoyable eating experience. I have always had good service at this establishment and the food comes out super fast. If you are looking to step out of the norm, try their grilled cesear salad. Mmmmm... sticky toffee pudding."
"I've live in the neighborhood and have been wanting to try this place out. When I went, there was a long line and people waiting outside. The hostess was so bubbly and assured us that there would be a short wait and it would not be long. After finally getting in, the wait was definitely worth it! The food was amazing (I had the rabbit) and the ambiance made me feel like I was in a bistro in Paris. Will definitely be back!"
"I went here last night for a friend's birthday party. ��The food was good, but I only give this place a two rating because the service starting with the hostesses was awful. I would even say incompetent. �� The hostesses were rude and seemed to have no sense of organization. ��We had reserved an area in the lounge and in the dining area. ��It took forever for us to be seated in the dining area (way past the actual reservation time), and at one point, we asked if they had seated our party since the group has dispersed because they were taking so long. ��The hostess took us to a table that was supposedly our party; a bunch of Asian people seated there(we were also Asian) and these people had no idea who we were. ��I could not believe that the hostess mistakenly thought our table had been seated an"
"I'm glad this Korean restaurant is in my neighborhood. ��Great Pi Bim Bap , i mean, Buddha Bowls. ��Great kimchi. ��I just wish Crisp had more variety of Korean foods like Kim Bap, Kim Ji Jigae, jap chae, chewy potato pizzas, mandu, Dwang Jung Jigae -- use the stone pots for real authenticity, guys! And I'd give my pinky finger for Naengmyeon! (you can skip the bondeggi, i insist. lol)Trust me, Chicago is ready for originality.Nice, clean place, affordable -- the same prices as in South Korea.Thanks for showing some variety to Americans! XD"
"After all the hype, I decided to try it out and was pretty disappointed. ��The food was ok, but not nearly worth the price. ��In a city like Chicago, there are so many delicious affordable restaurants that one like Sunda needs to come up with something a little more enticing than ""Asian Fusion."""
"Good food, slightly overpriced but no biggie. Our waiter was a mess though - he was sweating like he was competiting in a biathlon, which might have explained why it took him so long to bring everything to the table. Definitely better than that travesty Topolobampo though."
Had mojitos and caprinas here. Mojitos were fantastic. It was crowded but we found a seat to people watch. Beautiful interior. Crowd was the 20-30 something. ��Walked over to Marche for dinner. But was a fun stop on our way.
It was really nice to chill with friends here. I LOVE their cake! It was really good! Same thing for the other things I tried. It was fabulous!! Will bring my friends next time. :)
"so for such a busy place the food aint good. ive tried the 'bo luc lac' and the 'pho' and the spring rolls. NOT the best ive had. but, the mixed noodles thing is good and so was the crepe. maybe ill just come back for that."
Enjoy this place after work for a glass or two of wine. ��Gets a little pricey when you start ordering some food to munch on.
"We just got back from a bachelorette party in Chicago and chose Sunda for our dinner venue after it was suggested by a friend and it was great! ��The food, service and ambiance was exactly what we were looking for. ��We were seated right away ��and our server was attentive and the food came out in succession at a good pace. ��The manager came over with shots (with his head sushi chef, who my friends wouldn't stop staring at) and wished the bride to be congrats and continually made sure we were all set throughout our dinner. ��As for food, I loved everything we ordered, but a few things stuck on my palette in particular: ��Garlic noodles with blue crab - simple and they weren't cheap with the crab so there were good chunks in thereSteamed Baos - delicious (that's all that needs to be said)Spicy T"
best persian food and wonderful service!!!!!!
"Went here for a late dinner and was very impressed. ��A small venue means that it is very crowded especially in the winter when the outside patio is closed but the wait wasn't too bad and the bottle of wine helped pass the time. ��The food was delicious. ��The only part of the meal I didnt truly enjoy was the tuna appetizer. ��However the fried prosciutto balls were amazing and the chicken dish w/ the yogurt was equally great. ��However the dish that took the cake was the pork shoulder. ��I was able to cut through it with a spoon and the meat just melted in your mouth. ��A small drawback is that because it is so crowded and the seating is communal is that you sometimes have to talk quite loudly in order to talk during dinner. ��Even with that though, will be making many return trips here."
"Brussel Sprout Salad. Holy moly was it good. Seriously. So was everything they placed in front of us. Soft-shell crab, ""lemongrass lollipops,"" and a specialty maki with lobster and bacon called a crispy pig or something like that. Crazy good.It's pretty loud and ��a lot hipper than me. But good food and not nearly as pricy as I thought it would be. 4 adults with drinks and a shared desert plus 20%+ tip for $200."
I visited the Lux last week right at opening on Sunday. ��The beignets are fantastic as they melt in your mouth. Can't wait to go back for brunch.
best delivery sushi in Chicago! Get the white dragon!
"The food is good but the menus are terrible! for an upper class restaurant, having a menu that is made out of paper than looks copied is a cheap trick and not good what so ever!!"
"I have read and heard about Milk and Honey so many times and was looking forward to going, but my experience was less than stellar. ��I thought the food was good, but it was definitely not worth going back to deal with the rude wait staff. ��The place was nearly empty in the middle of the afternoon, but I was sternly spoken to twice about the ordering and seating system. ��Overall, not worth going back again."
"This is the place to bring a date.Great service, unbelievable food. ��It is very high quality. ��We didn't wait for anything as the wait staff was always there anticipating our needs.I don't recommend that you get one of the whole crab dishes. ��It looks like a big spider on your plate and is not that easy to take apart and eat. ��The entrees with stuffed crab are the best.There are places to walk around afterwards that are nearby, which again makes it great for a date.Highly recommend!"
I love good authentic Mexican food... Garcia's is not that. It is big and loud and the food is bland. I would actually eat Don Pablos before I eat here again.
"Theyre pizza is good. ��Definitely not a bad deep dish, just dont think its amazing...or the best in the city. ��But it is really really good. ��That said ive never been disappointed with Pedquods. ��There consistently good. ��They also have a good selection of beer and a great lunch special. ��I would recommend this place to frieds for sure."
"Love Sunda! ��We first went for the Chef's Tasting Menu deal I got on Groupon. ��Each portion of the menu was plentiful - more than enough for sharing between two people. ��Since then, we have gone back to order from the regular menu, and enjoyed that as well. ��The dining room is a bit on the loud side, but wasn't so bad that it would keep us away. �� Some of our faves - the Chop Chop Chicken Salad and the Rock Shrimp Tempura for starters. ��All of the sushi rolls we had were great - especially the Yellowtail Jalapeno roll. ��Have fun here and enjoy!"
"YUM!! ��Don't judge this place by the name - the fish is fresh and all the food we had was excellent. ��I reccommend the calamari - it's unlike any calamari I've ever had! ��I strongly suggest making dinner reservations because this place gets packed, and even with reservataions we had to wait like 15 minutes, but the overall service was wonderful. ��I've also been for breakfast, which was also really good and in the summer there is outdoor seating, which I love."
"This has now become one of my favorite restaurants! ��Our meal was amazing! My bf and I went on a sunday when the chef buys fresh ingredients at the farmers market and makes a fresh original menu that same day. ��We had the 7 course menu and we loved all the dishes. ��It was BYOB which was perfect and every dish was artfully displayed with wonderful dishes/pots/wodden stands/giant shells, etc. ��The presentation was beautiful and the food tasty. ��What a perfect meal! I'll def. be back!"
"I've always liked Bin 36 for the wine more than the food and actually hadn't been there for a while. Went for dinner and was completely blown away by the food. It was like Gordon Ramsey was in the kitchen --seriously! Everything was exquisitely flavored, beautifully cooked and presented. In the past I'd found some of the dishes overly ambitious and not quite delivering on flavor. But the asparagus soup, halibut entree (perfectly seasoned and cooked) and desert with luscious basil cream were divine. I used to remember the wine, and after that meal found myself thinking about the food."
"I am not a vegetarian or vegan, but one of my friends is. She made me come here and suprisingly, it was delicious. Lots of options, I didn't know what to get. I'll def be going back soon."
"Go to this place at least once. Amazing drinks, really neat atmosphere."
"I love Mia Francesca! It's loud yet cozy at the same time. I'm usually not a fan of loud restaurants but it was great service, high quality food and a decent price.Who cares if it is a chain? In fact, I wouldn't have known it if my dining companions hadn't pointed it out and then I looked it up.Tasty"
"Mercat a la Planxa is a great restaurant for a casual evening with a loved one or with a group of friends. The variety of tapas is similar to what you may have experienced at other tapas restaurants, but with a little upscale touch or twist to them.Upon arriving I was a little put off by the fact that some of the seats in the small entry-way bar were reserved. To my friends and I it was a little strange that there would actually be reserved seats in such a tiny space. Mercat a la Planxa has an extensive list of specialty cocktails as well as house-made sangria. We all opted for the sangria. It was good and multiples were ordered, but it was not outstanding. Having said that, at the time of our reservation we were escorted upstairs to the dining room which was like a breath of fresh air; tw"
"Very mediocre quality food. ��There really isn't anything special about this place except the mural outside. ��I've gone here several times and have never been impressed.To it's credit, the food is authentic, but bland and very greasy. There are much better choices (Milagro, Cucina Mundial)I honestly believe the positive reviews are primarily based on all the hype this place gets. ��As stated before, the food isn't bad, it just isn't good. �� Perhaps it's the atmosphere or the large crowds, I really don't know."
"Nana's I have eaten there twice in the past two weeks; once for breakfast and one time for dinner. It is really interesting food, very good flavor and different for any other place in the area by far. ��For dinner I thought it was out standing. ��Everything we ordered was perfect. ��For breakfast it was good, but a little pricy. The options are very different for any where less that you can go. ��I would check it out; your taste buds will be surprised"
"UUUGGGHHH!!!! loveitloveitloveitloveit!!I found this place on urban spoon, had great reviews there as well. It's such good food, even better atmosphere. Small, BYOB, and the owner is this little man who smiles and bows his head ten times while he thanks you for coming. I want one.I've had great memories there - went one night with friends, it was some other guys birthday. Everyone in the restaurant ended up cheering and singing happy birthday to him. Also on my roommate's birthday. They obligingly held on to a cake I had brought in earlier, presented it with candles after dinner, and we cut them all pieces afterward.The food is so fresh and I always order too much and force myself to eat it all. My only... criticism.I was somewhat tempted to rate it 0 and tell everyone there was a ��human f"
"Oh man this place is SERIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I went there for lunch today with a friend and i had the Spicy Falafel with rice on the side which was absolutely fantastic.......My friend had the Lamb Shawerma, ��that i tried and had to order one to go to eat later at work.......to die for......Great service and just heaven in your mouth food........."
Definitely a must see after the television segments on the historic Superdawg drive-in: 1) Great superdawgs & homemade french fries (some of the best i've ever had)2) The pickled tomato along with the pickle is an interesting addition to the top but they were great3) Quite a large drive-in; able to accommodate at least 30 cars i'd guess4) Definitely a must for a great superdawg & superfries when in the Northern Chicago area!
"This Korean restaurant manger doesn't know how to say Sorry when I found out the part of scoring pad in the steamed rice. It was 2inches big. I can not understand how it will happen. I don't know what's going on in the kitchen.Although they finally said sorry, what they were talking about was they will reduce the tax from the whole price of the food we ate for the apology. I never seen this kinda rude and hateful restaurant."
I have eaten at the location on Clybourn several times. The steak sandwich is good but a bit expensive if you drive a little farther west up Belmont to Cicero (Amira;s Trio)and make a left you will find the food better tasting and cheaper priced. ��Otherwise 90 miles is good if your in their area
"I'm probably not the first to admit that the Winter Delights menu drew us in. We're not cheap but we love when we have an opportunity to get good quality food at a fair price rather than having to break the bank. While they are known for steak, I opted for seafood. They have a nice wine selection and the portions are plentiful. Dessert had to be shared because we were both way full."
"I was recently in Chicago on business and my client took me to Tru. Well lets start by saying that Tru is, indeed, a True experience. ?This is what the loosely used term fine dining is really meant to be. ?Everything was truly amazing, it took them less than two minutes to sit us at a beautiful table, and within three minutes we had not one but two waiters taking our drinks order, and serving us. We selected our napkin color (strange, but cool), and had a great three hour dining experience. We opted for the tasting menu and each dish was flawless. The ribeye with the grilled foie gras stood out as the most memorable for myself. The meal was enhanced by the personal service of Carlos. ?He really made it an exceptional experience. He recommended us some great dinner options, port and cheese "
"I'm from LA, and Superdawg blows away Pinks."
"Some friends drug me here during Mardi Gras, in spite of my many reservations. Being pescetarian, the ""Coastal Southern Cooking"" intrigued me, but I sensed there would be some form of pork in everything, and if there's one thing I can't stand, it's greasy pork. I was assured that the menu would be very eclectic, and being in Andersonville, they'd have at least a couple of veggie options.Well call me a fan, there was a lot to choose from! I wound up going with a mushroom etouffee on the Mardi Gras menu, and my friends got a po boy and two others split a sampler. I can't speak for teh sampler, because there was pork in some of it, but I did taste the vegetarian beans and they were smoky, spicy. My etouffee was awesome, rich and flavorful, and the fried oyster I snuck reminded me of why I mis"
"I went here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. ��The decor is stylishly done (particularly the stained glass windows at the back). ��Bartenders were very helpful. ��I started off with a flight of six or so beers. I particularly liked the Cross of Gold and the two IPAs. ��The bartender also suggested I'd like the Porter and, to my surprise I did. ��Lots of great beer choices. And you can take away beer in a growler. The menu is really interesting. ��I had the Moroccan Chicken Salad, which was totally delicious. ��Overall, I really like this brewpub. ��It's nice to drink REAL beer and not be surrounded by lots of televisions.The only down side: They have REALLY small salt and pepper shakers. ��I felt bad for the bartender whose job it was to refill these."
I have been a long time fan of Mia and have now created this yelp account just to let people know exactly how horrible the management is at this place. ?I have been going to Mia regularly for almost 3 years now and will NEVER go back ever again. ?This really hurts since I enjoy the food there. ?I had called in and was told there was no wait. ?I showed up 20-30 minutes later and was told the wait was over an hour. ?I then asked to be put on the waiting list and was told I was the only one on the list. ?I tried to figure out who I talked to on the phone and the two women at the front made me feel like I was some sort of idiot....and had never been there before. ?Quite the opposite. ?I then waited for a bit and there were 2 open tables up front (we were a party of two). ?The two tables sat em
"I just wanna say that you have to try the nachos they have. They melt in your mouth, and I get them without meat.There steak is much better than any of the meat they offer. There service is slightly better than ok, but they seemed annoyed that we arrived there a little before 230 when the place closes at 3 on Saturdays."
"Good: - Free valet parking - Attentive staffs who do clean your table periodically - Food price is reasonable (not for drinks)Bad: - Crowded, crowded, crowded - I guess it's a plus for many people then, but I do prefer quite place that I can have normal conversation, not having to talk loudly. - No free refill for fountain drinks (seriously, $2 for each glass of 2/3 ice and 1/3 coke?) - The family style option is awful (I chose #1), the quality is extreme mediorce. - The roast lamb leg has a taste of something else (most of you here probably have not tasted that something else, and I don't bother to mention it, if I do most of you will puke. Yeah, I'm an Asian, I did eat weird thing) - Incorrect food description: In the menu they have Dolmades and Meatballs. Let me correct this, you got ON"
walking by glens you might not know it but... inside is a magic place that could easily be found in east coast ocean side town. the food was amazing [ I had a bowl of new england clam chowder and poor boy shrimp sandwich ] . my server was real kind and nice.. this is going to be my weekday lunch spot for now on
"I was very disappointed with my visit here. I ordered the meatball sub with beef fat fries and when it was walked over to me from 10 feet away, the sandwich was COLD, the break was luke warm and stale, there was maybe a teaspoon of sauce on it and the fries were cold and soggy. I politely asked if I could have my sandwich reheated and I was told they couldn't do anything about it except put it in the oven. When I got back my food, still cold, but not as cold as the looks on the faces of the 4 teenagers in chef uniforms. This place shouldn't serve food."
"Wow, this place is an absolute gem. My BF and I went here for our anniversary and it was perfect. The service was excellent,the waiter was helpful and attentive without being the least bit intrusive or pushy. The vibe in the place was great- it was laid back and dimly lit, but had a mixture of people dressed up and in jeans.The food was incredible. I got the spinach gnocchi and I can't get it out of my mind! Though the entrees are a little pricey, they make up for it by being BYOB. We will be back...many many more times!"
The excellent kobe brisket outweighs the terribly slow service.
"The pizza is actually very good but to call it authentic I am not to sure. Maybe someone's idea of authentic is based on a different part of Italy. Be careful not to go until later, because before 9 it's like going to a pricey version of Chuck E Cheese."
"Delicious. ��Colorful, warm atmosphere. ��Attentive, knowledgeable service. ��Been to a fair number of upscale, trendy places for dinner, but most of them are loud, pretentious, and nothing special; I don't usually think I would spend the money to go again. ��Carnivale, on the other hand, is worth every penny. ��I want to go back!"
"Best lil mom n' pop pizza joint to come into chicago. ever. While we are home to deep dish etc...FOGO 2 Go makes a wild range of over the top thin crust pizzas that leave you salivating convert from the Chi ""norm""!super fresh ingredients. the sauce is to die for!PROS: Tuesday (our normal roommate and kids pizza night) for one pizza that you buy FOGO 2 donates a pizza to the church food ministry across the street! feeding he homeless homemade dinner, just wonderful giving back to the community like that!CONS: the menu is very small and poorly designed, it's a little hard to make a choice since it's all jumbled up. but once you do, it's always the right pizza you chose!"
The place is great! ��The taste is excellent with a great price. ��We love the chocolate cip pancakes and their salads. �� Around noon it can get hectic--but the food makes the wait worth it.
"We arrived at Kinzie Chop House very late (10:30 p.m.), just returning to Chicago from South Bend. ��Even though we were ""under-dressed"" for this restaurant, we were welcomed with open arms. ��Our waiter was very gracious and provided us with information that the kitchen would be closing within a short time period and about specials and great recommendations. ��We started with a Manhattan and Lemon Zest Martini. ��Both were prepared as requested and very tasty. ��With our waiter's suggestion, we ordered the Rock Shrimp Rissoto Cake with Lobster Sauce. ��It was excellent with a crunchy crust and with sauce with a touch of heat at the end. ��Our party enjoyed the Steak Rissoto, Apple Wood Smoked Pork Chop and the Steak and Shrimp special. ��The steak special was cooked to a perfect medium rare. ��The"
"A favorite for a late lunch, w/time to relax. I try a new dish nearly every time. I appreciate their flavor profiles & seasonal dishes. I do love this place, but 2 things: although the staff is terrific, the service is always, always, interminably slow. Some slices of homemade bread or ... Something... Would help ease the annoyance of long waits. Depending upon who's making them, the cocktails can be terrific. The price point is a little high, but it only really bothered me when we tried the fish fry; $19.00 for 2 small pieces of fish & the plate filled w/fries -- & this ain't all you can eat. At $12 a plate, tops, I'd be 'OK' w/it, but $19 is way out of proportion to what you get."
"Best place ever. The food is delicious ,the place is so beautiful and the service is amazing."
This has to be my favorite restaurant ever. I went here for the first time couple weeks ago. It was an excellent experience. The second you walk in you feel like your VIP lol. The waiters are on top of things too. The food is so good too. The meats. Ahhh the meats. So many to choose from. You can even choose how well you want it done by requesting it cut from certain portions of the roast. They are 5 stars all the way. Come hungry because its all you can eat. It is a little bit pricy but its well worth it.
"What can I say. If you haven't tried this place yet, DO IT. They make you feel at home."
"I have been here a few times and was never really happy with my experience. I like the feel of the place and its coziness BUT they kept my order wrong....every time. The food was also not very good I am just not impressed with any part of the Chicago Diner after so many promising reviews. Sorry, would not eat here again!"
This resturant is the only reason i joing yelp. I wish i had founded this place a long time ago. Can't see anythin wrong with this place. Love it!!!!! Just perfect.
"I can not say enough about Meli Cafe, the chef Frank Georgacopoulos creates so many interesting items on his menu, one has to go on Saturday and Sunday to fully enjoy it all. ��Wait is long on weekends but what do you expect from a place with kick-ass food. ��The owners are cool mellow guys, who entertain the customers with their antics, the girls up front are a riot....the younger of the two (a little hottie F.Y.I.) is worth checking out.Item you have to try is the Meli Honey Cakes, and Spicy Flamenco omelet."
"This was the best culinary meal I have ever experienced. Entrance to the restaurant is pleasing and unassuming with gentle colors and a warm, friendly staff. ��I ordered the foie gras, hapu and chocolate dessert. ��With me, 3 guests each ordered something entirely different so we could share the experience with each other. ��You needn't be a foodie to understand the 'perfect bite' concept of dining...and you certainly don't have to be an art critic to enjoy the colorful and curious presentation on each plate. ��Ask your server how the dish is prepared...this was also fun and entertaining, in and of itself. ��The foie gras starter captured my immediate attention with a soft, sweet creaminess and earthy texture of the base...this could have been a dessert...but not is a sugary-sweet way...the fla"
Barbara F. is an idiot and should stick to hosting baby showers at diners.
"Been eating at Calo since before I could walk (back when they had a bowling alley!) Best thin crust pizza in Chgo, and also the best next day pizza. Can't remember having a bad meal there, had my 8th grade and high school graduation dinners there. A true neighborhood icon. The only possibly bad thing is I think the cannoli s ��are either made and then frozen or bought frozen. Small thing."
"I had been told by at least 6 random people over the last year to try Irazu, and I'm glad I listened to them! ��The meal was excellent, the prices very fair, and the portions were very large. ��Nearly everyone I saw at every table was bringing leftovers home. ��Get anything with the Lizano sauce on it- it's delicious! ��I'm within walking distance of Irazu and plan to stop by often. ��It got busy on a Friday after 7pm, so get there early or be prepared to wait a bit."
"I really like Meli. I go there almost 4 times a month because the meals are delicious, pretty good portions and the best breakfast place in the neighborhood. But something about that lady who stays by the door.... �� She is never smiling, i dont feel welcomed there. ��i asked her to be seated to the bigger section last time i was there instead of the small section which is by the door and she rolled her eyes at me. ��She is there every-time i go and i get a terrible vibe from her. ��Mr. Meli, maybe you need to hire a new hostess for better business."
"Delicious!!! I have lived in Italy, thus as extremely particular about Italian food in Chicago, especially pizza. I've heard about this place for years, and finally made my way out there last night. OMG! SO GOOD! I woke up craving it today! My boyfriend felt the same -- as close to being in Italy as it gets in Chicago. And they have pizza bianca! Yum yum yum!!!PS: You get a complimentary canoli on your way out -- what a lovely sweet touch!!! Thank you, Spacca Napoli!"
"The food is not bad, just very very pricey...$3.50 for ONE pancake???? Definately not a place to take my three kids for breakfast. However, I do make it in maybe once every month or so to get their baked chiliquiles, which are awesome and unlike anything I've ever before. Portions are kind of small, considering its a $12 breakfast. Pretty restaurant."
"The steaks here have never disappointed, my favorite steak place by far!"
"Grand Lux is one of the best restaurants in the Chicago area. Everything was delicious, especially the beignet dessert.. yumm"
One of my favorite places in the city! Love the cozy atmosphere and located in a fantastic locations. It's perfect for couples and friends get together. The Pork shoulder is amazing as well as the chorizo stuffed olives!
great ambiance. food was excellent.
"Overpriced and overrated! I've had a better meal experience at The Melting Pot for half the cost. The restaurant is definitely better suited for couples, but I wouldn't call it romantic given the proximity of the tables to each other. ��Entrees range from $47-$61 per person and includes a cheese fondue appetizer and a chocolate fondue dessert. The former was skimpy given the size of our group (5) while the former tasted little more than melted Hershey's kisses. Both times we had to ask for more dipping breads or fruit. We only ordered 4 entrees thinking we would have more than enough food. We were wrong. I have had more beef and chicken on a kabob than what was served here. The entree platter was heavy on broccoli, green peppers and onions, not exactly what you would think of deep frying in"
"Art of Pizza gets my vote for Best Chicago Pizza. ��Not only is their pizza top-notch; you can even buy it by the slice which is a major perk! ��I don't think they have delivery which is sort of a con, but the pizza is well worth the effort to go pick it up. ��It is a melt in our mouth type of pizza!"
"of course the food and and service is great, but the staff needs to maybe take it down a notch.... a bit over the top to the point of annoying, very pretentious. ��the atmosphere is very very dry and everyone whispers as if im at a funeral? I get the whole experience and chicago scene and whatnot, but guys, it's ok, friendly conversation with the patrons is ok. i hate to say it but when i left i laughed a little.. haha"
"I have always enjoyed Asian cuisine, especially Vietnamese. I have been going to Simply It restaurant on Lincoln and Belden. The food is healthy, light and delicious. While dining in, I noticed that the restaurant was offering a cooking class and I was so on board.The class took place on Monday the thirteenth at 5:30 pm. I was never much of an enthusiastic student but as soon as they greeted me with such charisma and joy, I was actually looking forward to the class. Though I felt like I was in a convention when they gave us name tags they actually helped bring the whole class together. Wine, beer, soda and others were provided to accompany the food we were going to indulge. We were introduced to Chef Kim once class started. She was very well spoken and attentive to the class, answering que"
"The ambiance is great for a date and there are a lot of interesting things on the menu. The waitstaff was also very attentive. I wanted to order the risotto, but then my date ordered it, so (without too many vegetarian options) I ended up going with the spaghetti with fennel. While my date was satisfied with the risotto, I found the spaghetti a bit bland. There was a great wine selection and the bread was really delicious. I would go back, but I wouldn't say it's one of my top places."
"We had a great experience at Alinea. We have been meaning to go here for months now and finally were able to go on a free night. The food was absolutley to die for! Great service, we would recomend it to everybody."
My friend took me here for my birthday and I cannot say enough about the amazing experience I had at Piccolo Sogno. The food is AMAZING and the service and atmosphere are top notch. I can't thank Chef Tony and everyone who waited on our table enough for making my birthday so memorable. I can't wait to come back to this restaurant and have already told everyone I know that they MUST check this place out! :)
"I love this place. ��And it makes me really happy to see that they are doing well. ��The last time I visited, it was a Monday night and the place was packed: good sign. ��We were still seated within five minutes of walking in and our meal was cooked remarkably fast as well. ��We started with tofu spring rolls, which were so good my roommate got a second order of them for us to share. ��Then for the main course, I got a huge and delicious bowl of pho which included all of the ""nasty bits"" I love. ��All I can remember was tripe and this really tasty gelatenous thing. ��But the real winner in the dish was the thinly sliced beef, which was still medium-rare when it got to the table and had cooked all the way through by the time I finished it. ��So tender, so delicious. ��I can't honestly remember what "
"They have the best patio in the city. It has a variety of Italian accents (rosemary, plums, figs, lemon tree). The patio, hidden behind a wood fence, makes you feel like you are in Italy. Sleitran sea salt - encrusted Mediterranean sea bass and homemade gelatos - true Italian dining experience."
"Wonderful experience! I just recently had my wedding dinner here and could not be any happier with the service and the cuisine. All my guests could not stop raving about the food. �� Luis, the manager, was very helpful and great with communication to set the party up.The outdoor patio is beautiful and set the perfect ambiance for my wedding!"
My roommate would talk about this place and I had never been until last year when we stopped in after he ran the marathon. The crust is the best part.
Best stuffed PIZZA in Chicago! Also good other food and good service! Too bad no other locations. Wish they delivered farther west. But I still take a ride for your pizza! Art of Pizza rocks!
"My roommate and I went out for a relaxing Sunday 4:30 cheese and wine dinner. ?What started out a great experience turned into us being pushed out by 3 different members of the staff after and hour and fifteen minutes.We had reservations and arrived right when the restaurant opened. ?We were seated within 10 minutes and our waitress seemed really nice. ?We didn't want to do the large plattters, we just came in for cheese and wine. ?We said we were going to order a bottle and the waitress recommened one that was very good.Now I know that it is the waiters/bussers job to fill waters, but their was gentleman in a pony tail that came around every 5 minutes to refill our waters, even if it didnt need refilling. ? He asked us 3 times if we wanted to get dessert and I repeatedly told him no. ? It"
"I liked this place ok. Compared to NYC brazillian steakhouses that I've been to it's not number one on my list. ��Service is great, the only gripe that I had was that I was wearing a white shirt, and when they sliced the meat a bunch of its juices got on my white shirt. ��Nothing was done about it. ��So I would say, be careful if you're wearing something nice."
"I LOVE their fried chicken! The soul sassy is Sooo good!It's crispy and juicy too with reeeeeeally goos seasoning.We get carry out, I don't like the long benches where u sit next to strangers if you eat there.ONE OF THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN IN CHICAGO.They always have fast friendly service too."
"My fiance and I went to Graham Elliot Friday for an early Valentine's Day. ��I didn't quite know what to expect given the mixed reviews lately, but I have to say I was quite satisfied.For starters, we ordered the Duck Confit and Potato Bisque. ��The duck was simply amazing. ��The apples and bits of duck fat were delicious, and the duck was cooked to perfection. ��The potato bisque was very interesting as it came out as a potato skin with cheese and sour cream with some proscioutto in a bowl. ��They then poured the soup form a teapot at the table. ��It was very flavorful, but the duck was better.For entree, the lady had the scallops, which were the most perfectly cooked scallops I've ever eaten. ��She was raving about the brown butter and almonds for the next two days.I had the sturgeon, which I h"
The burgers weren't as good as we thought they would be and the truffle fries were too salty.
"visited Chicago for the holidays. ?wanted to go to frontera. ?heard a lot about it. ?alex g,'s best thing she ever ate. yes, the steak was very good, but chicago has MEAT,,,real meat. ?my only complaint was the staff. ?they work at a hugely popular restaurant, but seem to take no pride in it. ?no smiles, no 'thank you, no fun. ?cheer up, guys. if you don't like your job, stay home. ?you turn people off.p.s. ?had no problem getting in. ?don't be afraid of all the hard to get reservations hype. ?they know how to pack 'em in."
Hands down GREAT EATING!!!If you love Chicago pizza join my FB page!!!http://www.facebook.com/��_
Best steak tacos in Chicago hands down.
"Was well aware of the 30-40 minute wait despite having reservations, and it was Friday night, so no biggy.Had a very cool and crisp caipirinha during the wait.Ceviche Mixto for app.. very nice and flavorfulChuleta for me, Churrasco for my manChuleta - wood-grilled pork chop with peppers, caramelized onion broth and bacon-plantain FUFU!! Pork was very tender, and though I never eat pork less than well-done, I decided to go with the Chef's recommended medium rare, and it was perfect. Beautiful combination with the peppers. And the FUFU!! I could have had a bucket of the fufu alone. Loved the sweetness and texture, but I think I just like saying FUFU!Had a bite of the Churrasco (wood grilled beef tenderloin), which was very good and tasty, and I'm one that usually stays away from beef.Excelle"
"correct me if im wrong, but this place is awesome. ��My friend celebrated her birthday here and we left the place very full and satisfied. ��I m already thinking of celebrating my birthday here. ��The servers are very helpful and the sushi is marvelous. fantastic and terrific All good stuff.When i found out that they deliver too, i ordered the next day= yes, it was that good.can't wait to order for more."
incredible!
"Recently my friend's birthday was thrown here. I came in from the suburbs and was a bit late, as luck made it. I came in when they were still waiting on their table because the place was packed at the time.It wasn't too bad, we waited only twenty minutes, but I was really impressed that we got tons of little finger food appetizers while we waited. It made me feel like the owner really cared and did the best he could possibly do while we were waiting. The wait wasn't too bad either, we were talking, making up for lost times and before the party knew it. Our table was ready!By then, we had all sat down got all our orders in. The service is so great here! they were able to get us in and out for our movie, the food came out quickly everything being delicious- of course!they made sure we had ev"
"For my 19th birthday I wanted to try something new. I had heard about the Grand Lux but I never actually got to experience it for myself.Soon as we walked in I was already pleased. When I pushed through the swivel doors my mother and I were quickly greeted with a warm smile. Not only was the host inviting, the whole outlook of the interior was warm and welcoming. The dimmed lights added to the cool night effect making it look even more elegant than it already was. The host walked us over to the escalators and once we reached the top we were once again enlightened with a bright friendly face. I chose to be seated at one of the tables along the perimeter of the circular room which faces Michigan and Grand Avenues. Oh, what a view from the wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling windows! Warm bread"
"Wow what a great experience, including the service, atmosphere and food. ��Though they might want to not be so afraid of the electric bill and turn the lights up just a touch, just a touch (bit of a joke, realize that adds to the swankiness of the place). ��The seafood tower was a memorable experience, and a recommendation if you have a party on the larger side. ��Can't say that I can recall a better bone-in filet, the hot plate and sizzle was a nice touch."
"Hands down the BEST breakfast place in the Chicagoland area...and I've been to quite a few because I heart breakfast food. ��Love the ambience, the food, the fresh juices...reminds me of breakfast places I've been to in NYC."
"We love this place! ��The food and the margaritas are delicious! ��It's great for families with young kids too. ��Tasty chips and salsa, yummy quacamole with onion. My husband loves the chorizo burrito and the strawberry margaritas on the rocks. ��The kids (6 yrs and 2 yrs) ��and I love the chicken quesadilla meal. ��Make sure to ask for the quacamole on the side, otherwise they put it inside and then they're not as good to reheat as leftovers. The rice and beans are fresh and tasty. ��I also really like the steak taco salad. ��The steak tastes like fajita steak with grilled onions, chihuaha cheese, jalapenos, tomato and lettuce in a crispy taco bowl. ��Not too big, just the right size so I don't feel like I've over eaten. ��And the strawberry margaritas, on the rocks, are amazing! �� We go to dinner"
Best Italian restaurant in the city!
"SuperDawg is as good as it gets. �� Hands down, no BS the best hot-dawg in the city. �� All I can say...the taste..the experience..the attitude. �� I am not a drive-in guy. �� I park, buy, and I am out. �� So I really connot comment on service, but as far as the food. �� Some may read this and say its a fast food place..Whats so special? �� My only response is try the dawgs. �� On that note, I have had one of the best grilled cheese ever there. �� Have you ever gone to a rib place, and tried the chicken? �� The usual response is no. �� Try whatever is on the menu..whatever you feel like at the moment, I guarantee it is all good. �� Please let me know if you do not agree...I will have to question you, and your taste buds also...something is wrong with you."
"Yes, I really love the food here. ��It has the best mapo tofu in town let alone compare to many other chinese restaurants in other cities. ��I really think chicago has some really amazing chinese restaurants. ��They also have a really good vegetarian dish called tong cai (it's a vegetable that they sauteed in garlic) that I always order when I am there. ��The food comes out right away and is always hot!! ��Their hot and sour soup is really amazing too. ��My husband enjoys the wonton soup a lot. ��We also really enjoy the beef with green pepper (it's not spicy unless you ask for it). ��The only thing that I don't really like about this restaurant is that it can get really busy and you would have to wait for a table especially when you get their around 830-900 pm. ��Be prepare to wait but the food is"
"This is one of my favorite places to eat at. It's clean and really shiny inside! The inside is really beautiful. They have a room in the back left that has beautifully painted walls and a great view of Michigan Ave. The bakery is really nice with a glass case where you can see all the amazing looking desserts as you walk past. The food...where do I begin? The potato spring rolls are the best. The shaking beef is amazing, the strawberry lemonade is great, and the desserts are soo yummy. The best are the chocolate chip pecan cookies, the apple crisp, and the deep dark fudge cake. The only negative is that the floor is really really slippery and the wait for a table is long, but the amazing food makes up for it."
I absolutely love this place. The lamb is delicious.Great place to take your family. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.
"Love this place! It's a great location and I love the atmosphere. I've been going there for years to meet up with friends, for lunch, dinner, coffee or pastries. I'm not sure if they make their own pastries but I went there last week and noticed they had macarons, I bought some not really expecting anything and I was gladly surprised, good job to the person who made them! I have tried macarons all around Chicago and would have never imaged I would find the best at a Greek cafe! Besides that they also have surprinsingly great pizza! As well as great tiropitas, zambonopita etc And feel free to try their Greek pastries with a vissinada ( greek cherry drink) they are very good.I will be going back for years to come."
"It was good, but it wasn't better than Trotter's, unless you are into the gadgets. And 24 courses is just too long."
"I was excited to try this place being billed as mexican street sandwiches, this was a sad disappointment. The suckling pig didn't have any flavor at all! Please put some salt or regular not pickeled jalapenos. Also, they didn't use a torta bun, the bread was some french loaf that was as hard as a rock. The price wasn't even close to street food, $12, thats crazy! The only reason I give this place 2 stars is because the churros and Aztec chocolate were very good."
"I love this place! ��I know, another Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, but this one is the best! ��The Oyster Bar great-it's not pretentious or snooty and I can always get a table, even when it's busy. ��As at all LEYE restaurants the service is impeccable. ��The seared tuna is to die for and the scallops never fail me. ��They pour a stiff drink and never rush you out. ��I just can't stay away! ��My only complaint is that they close too early."
Loooooong wait times but worth it if it's your first time.
"Friendly wait staff, wonderful change of pace for the neighborhood. BYOB w/ no corkage, yummy food, reasonable prices. I would return."
"If you don't mind having your food delivered late and your order messed up go ahead, but as far as delivery goes, I prefer a place with a little more attention to detail."
"Wish I could review the food, but it never got that far! Friday night I ordered on grubhub, 60 bucks worth, because my bro and his wife were visiting and have never had sushi! So I ordered from Sunda cuz ive heard it was good.. Well they call back like 15 mins later saying they dont deliver to me.. Ok fine, im over it... Until today, tuesday it is still a debit on my account, no refund yet. So I call grubhub and the guy i talked to called sunda right away. He called back, he was super super nice, he said they never processed any kind of refund ;( Thought I would just forget about it? Ha, yeah right! I watch my money closely guys!!! Maybe this was a mistake, but if I were them (I have worked in service industry for about 6 years) I would have made sure to refund immediately! If I wouldnt ha"
"I was a ZED451 virgin until this past weekend. I was throughly impressed with the staff, the atmosphere and the amazing salad and cheese bar. The meat selections were fabulous and any foodie HAS to try this place. I'm anxious to return and try their infamous brunch-- I hear the eggs benedict are the best in town!Also, the wine selection is great."
"I was in with a friend on sat without a reservation and it was so crowded! ��I was able to find a seat at a table in the bar (thank god because we were moody, hungry and about to leave). ��We ended up having a great time! ��My server, Lee was awesome! ��She really turned the night around for us. She made some great suggestions (from delicious wines to yummy bone-in filets and au gratin potatoes) and was right on point. Also, the bar was so beautiful with great atmosphere. ��I loved the singer too! ��I will be back soon but probably during the week when hopefully it won't be so busy.ps-You must try the desserts! ��(butter cake esp)"
"We enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Alinea several nights ago. ?Each of the nineteen courses was superb, a taste delight. ?The food is five stars! ?Wow!The rest of the Alinea Experience does not, sadly, reach the five star pinnacle, as some other reviewers have noted: ? ? ?1. ?The dining room is ordinary, not welcoming and warm, almost utilitarian; it needs some touches that say, we created this space just for you, so glad you are here, a design theme of some sort. ? ? ?2. ?The service is generally attentive and polished, but mechanical, choreographed but lacking in the finest service touches; we felt that once we were seated, we were given a place at the Alinea Experience conveyor belt and the task of the staff was just to keep the belt moving, no slippage allowed. ? ? ?3. ?The servers are s"
Oh Bad Apple!!! Love Love Love!! For me this place beat out the counter and DMK. I ordered the black and blue with the truffle fries! I really would like this right now as im writing haha....a great place for the food and also the drink menu!! A great selection of craft beer!!....the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is trendy and fun!!
"Our service was amazing which was just icing on the cake to a truly delicious meal. ��Our waiter had great recommendations while being knowledgeable about the entire menu. ��Everything we tasted (a lot of the menu) was wonderful.The BBQ was by far the best that I have had in Chicago. ��The ribs came right off the bone with almost no effort. ��The brisket was so tender it only needed a fork to cut. ��The pulled pork was so perfectly seasoned, no sauce was even needed but fun to have the four options on the table to experiment with.The atmosphere was fun and energetic, great for a celebration or just a fun night out."
"Loved it.Loved, loved, loved it.Went here for the first time after the boyfriend and I got into a screaming fight and decided to make up over hot dogs and cheese fries. Got there around 11:30, waited maybe 10 minutes and was treated with a delicious, delicious chicken and cranberry sausage, coated in honey with thick chunks of creamy, salty cheese. Needless to say, the relationship has lasted more than the day, and my Hot Doug's experience has been cemented in my mind as a top 10 experience. If you're in the city, just go. You're welcome in advance."
"smart decor good food and super service, nice job'"
"I should share this personal detail first.... Recovering vegetarian here. Doug helped me cross back over to the land of encased meats. ��The line vs. the fabulous dogs? ��I am lucky enough to live in the general area and don't have to treat Doug's as a destination restaurant. ��But the line is a bit overwhelming on the weekends (Friday and Saturday at hot doug's). ��and the weekend is the only time you can get the fabulous duck fat fries.Everything I have ever tried has been fabulous. ��I am particularly fond of the Portuguese linguica and Catalonian pork sausage with their particular toppings. ��(saffron aioli, aged manchego, etc.) Perfect combinations of flavors that you won't find anywhere else. ��Don't forget cash only. ��(I have seen one couple wait in a long line to get to inside and see the"
"this place is great, the staff is always friendly, the food is outstanding. the eggplant parm is the best i have had."
I have been to Cafe 28 about 10 times. I think the food is great and think they have the best steak tacos in town. I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact you always have to wait on the weekends.
"We're new to the neighborhood and were thrilled to discover Calo. ��It's our favorite standby. ��The menu is very expansive, the prices are very fair, and the service is always attentive and friendly. ��We LOVE the thin crust pizza and have some great luck with a few pasta dishes. ��I have been disappointed by their fish and chicken... ��so head somewhere else if you craving a big plate of protein. ��I wouldn't describe Calo as being upscale, as some other reviewers do. ��In my opinion, it is very comfortable, casual and friendly. ��Almost like a supper club. ��A perfect place for a easy-going and yummy meal!"
"I liked it quite a bit. ��Great food, liquor and ambiance. ��Quite impressed with how they handled my better half who is a veg. ��The chef was more than happy to modify a couple things on the menu to accommodate her tastes. ��Good - Chicken, meatballs and bourbon..Bad - ventilation (was pretty bad, but the host said something broke that evening and would be fixed the next day). Overall I think I found my new watering hole."
Best pancakes in the world!! ��OMG ��thats all i could say!!
"This review is for the burger only. I want to first say, I am not bias--even though I am a naive chi-towner. But, this burger will make want to slap somebody (as, m mom use to say)!! Seriously good and hardy. You will not be disappointed with this diner experience. You can order a Vegan milk shake and some fries!! Truly the best thing going!!"
"Love this place. ��Though a little pricey for portions that are sometimes on the smaller side, I've been there a lot. ��It's tried and true, and a good place to bank on."
"Service was very poor , quantity of food was little and Chengeh (beef Kabob) was almost burnt. No apology from server or try to correct the problem. Would rather go to Reza."
Good food and drinks but definitely not enough for the price. While this place is good it is way too expensive. Also the serving sizes are way too small in my opinoin.
Very disappointed. ?Not much better than an all you can eat buffet. We were there late and the meats were dry. ?We felt rushed by the meat servers who were obviously trying to service us so they could finish their shift. ?We got up to the salad bar and came back to find a dirty wine glass at our table that had soiled the tablecloth. ?We got a half hearted do you want another table. ?Very bad experience.
"One of the best dining experiences ever. Definitely worth the price. I love to go to fine restaurants stateside and abroad. ?After reading the reviews, when I came to Chicago on a 3 day business trip, I decided to dine at Alinea. ?From the greeting at the door, to the fine service, ?to the spectacular meal, Alinea was an amazing trip for every sense and lots of fun - met every expectation. ?I was a solo diner and had a fantastic time. ?The staff was great and every dish was an adventure. ?Having read about the 20-25 courses, I decided to go with a Grand Cru champagne cocktail to start and forego the wine pairing. ?I never would have made it to the end had I opted for the wines. ?The portion sizes are perfect for each dish, and, by the end of the meal, I couldn't have eaten another serving."
"How could anyone rate this place below a 4 star review? You MUST not be human! This is the best junk food on earth. It simply doesn't get any better. If you are looking for fine dining this is not the place to go. I think the name Superdawg and walk up/curb service is a give-away that it's not fancy. If you're looking for a burger or hot dog that tastes like another down the street you'd be in the wrong place. Superdawg food has a taste that is all to it's own. It is absolutely wonderful food, decent service, and a good price. I wish I could give it more stars."
"Great experience all the way through. From food, ambiance, drinks to service. Worth the wait and lives up to its hype."
"Pretty kick ass place. Some days are 20% off for the working classFor extra spice, ask for the spicy red sauce at no fee, otherwise expect well seasoned but not actually hot."
Well worth the price. Don't miss the Ropa Vieja appetizer or the Arranchera entree!
Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in the city. It is my BF & mine go-to restaurant. Had one of my best lunches there last Friday. Definitely recommend the crab leg 3-course lunch!
"While the pizza is amazing, the woman answering the phones for take out orders shouldn't bring her terrible attitude to work. ��I understand everyone has bad days, but you are in customer service, and it's not my fault you hate your job. The pizza is excellent though."
"The pizza was phenomenal!I came in here on a Thursday night for a late dinner (dine in) and ordered a large, red pizza (crust, tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese) with fresh tomatoes, Italian sausage, and basil. I'm more of a traditionalist when it comes to pizza, so I don't care for mashed potatoes and broccoli. It came our relatively quick, which makes sense for a thin-crust pizza. The pizza had a very good balance of sauce, cheese, and crust; and the toppings were adequately distributed over the entire pizza (not clumped together, but also not overpowering the pizza experience). It was delicious to say the least.But the big winner here was the crust. It was plain amazing. Crust and sauce is really what makes a pizza since those ingredients are usually made in-house (I hope), while Italian "
"The best (and most affordable) falafel sandwich in Chicago, no contest."
"Le Colonial is a great place to take friends - family - or go on a date. I love the atmosphere and location, and the food is always very good! Great seafood and chicken dishes! I recommend!"
-Old cupcakes and very poor service going back to Starbucks!!!
Delicious! Cannot wait to go back!
"I saw the chef on Top Chef Masters, and his preparation of three different types of ahi tuna - a favorite dish in my family - made me decide immediately to go to his restaurant. Several months later, my dad and I brought his parents there. The service was perfect; my water glass never reached half full, and our waiter was happy to answer any questions or meet any special requests we had. The food was amazing; I ended up taking on five courses to get a taste of everything. Overall, a great experience, and I would recommend it to anyone wanting some awesome food in a chill restaurant."
Place to go.. Awesome food.. great price. would recommend everyone .. if you chinese food fan.. heres the right place.
Going here during there bar happy hour is the best deal I have found. ��Mussels !!!!
"The food at this restaurant is pretty good. ?unfortunately, this fact is tempered by a waitstaff and management who treats their customers like they are too cool to do their job. ?I have had several bad expereinces there, finally adding up to more than just coincidence ?I have been several times, and everytime I'm met with incompetency and arrogance - a bad combination. ?Once, my reservation was lost on arrival, even after I had called to confirm it. And instead of trying to fix it, the hostesses tried to convince me that it must have been my fault in some way. ?Another time I ordered a drink in the downstairs bar, but the bartender didn't feel like getting one of the missing ingredients from the upstairs bar, so he told me to order something else. This was followed by a dining experience "
"Great ambiance, fantastic beer, and fabulous mussels & pomme frites!A great place to be able to walk to from home!"
"Pizza, Chicken, and Salads. ��All of them tasty. �� Definitely try the half chicken.The guys that run the place are great too!"
Food is really good and reasonable priced! Try the peking duck!!
Excellent place for Sushi! ��I have to admit that I probably can't call myself a Sushi connoisseur because I do not dive into the sashimi aspect of this type of dining very often but I do love maki rolls. ��This restaurant is not elaborate or fancy...but the sushi is exceptional! ��The price is also very reasonable in comparison to places like Sushi Wabi without compromising quality or taste. ��They always have a unique special..the lastest had yellow tail with mango...very good! ��My boyfriend and I have done carry-out at this place more often than not and then we can create our own romantic style evening with wine and fabulous food. ��Try it out.
"Love this place . I have never gotten a order in which i didnt like . All of my food was prepared well , good portions ��good price ."
"can i just say this place is AWESOME!! every time i go there i feel like I'm on vacation! seriously! i love the outdoor seating you feel like your away somewhere on vacation every time for real! the ambiance is so cozy and the big tree and the lights make you feel so relaxed! i love that i can dress to impress and everyone around looks that way too ;) the food is fantastic, you don't have to wait long time to get your order's, waitstaff is great ! and i hope they stay open for a long time! LOVE IT!!!"
"Big time good stuff. Long lines - plan accordingly. Expensive, but supply-and-demand, ya know. Highly recommended."
"I live in Streeterville yet this is my favorite sushi place to go to. ��Sushi is always tasty and fresh! Service is great. I always make reservations, especially on the weekend. This is a great place to meet with your girlfriends, try different kinds of sushi and have a bottle of vine. The bill is always inexpensive and the place is super cozy. I had my birthday dinner there as well and all the girls loved the atmosphere."
"The ONLY reason I ended up here is because I had an awesome coupon from http://restaurant.com...now that the coupon has been used, I shan't be returning. Maybe it's because we got there early, but the place smelled like dirty dishrags. The food was decent and the place was clean, but the clientele seemed to be a full of Wrigleyville transplants. It's a total douchebag sports bar. I often walked by on my way to the cheaper bars (did I mention the $8 tumbler of Stella I bought here?) and, while I knew immediately that this place was not designed to attract people like me, I figured I'd end up there at some point. Well, I did. I came. I saw. I left with a big bar tab. I will likely never return."
"So happy to have Simply It just down the street from me! I grew up eating Vietnamese food and always crave it, but never have the time to go all of the way up to Argyle. Their pho is great, and I love how they do it the authentic way when I order it delivered and leave the thinly sliced raw beef on the side to pour the boiling broth over. Love ordering bun bo xao va cha gio, super healthy, fresh, light, and yummy. Added bonus? It's a BYOB and super affordable for a casual night out with friends."
"Was not what we thougt it would be ,but the food did look good.Love the cute place and the artwork ��and great service."
Great place. Sat at the counter and had great service.
"RUDE!! I have never been treated so rudely by someone, the hostess staff should realize who pays their salary: the customers. I took a group to Gilt Bar for a business dinner. Made reservations for 7:00, arrived at 6:30 and were made to wait for half an hr ... Even though there were numerous empty tables. Once the hostess deemed us near-worthy, she seated us at a table that had been empty since we arrived. The table was small, next to the front door, and in a very busy spot so I politely asked for a different table (there were at least 6 - 7 empty in immediate view) ?She snapped that the other table was being saved in case a party of 5 came in (there were only 4 of us). I pressed the issue so she turned to my business associates, snatched the menus out of their hands, tossed them onto the "
Fantastic micro brew options and some of the most cratie burgers in town. ��This place ��has a great vibe-hip but neighborhood and never fails to deliver. ��Just plain solid food and experience every time
the history says it all. drinks are a little overpriced but that the only problem besides the stinky bathrooms but a bar that old cant reallly help that. Best live jazz in town.
"Took the family for my dad's birthday. Had a wonderful time. Very old school, not many of them left. Awesome italian food for a great price and tons of food so maybe share."
"My date really wanted to have dinner at Sunda because she loves the food. I have never been there before and heard great things so thought I'd give it a go. We arrived around 7:30 PM on a Friday so I knew it would be busy and didn't expect to be seated for a long time. The Hostess was very nice and said we may dine at their communal tables or at the bar. We said ""thanks"" but prefer a table reservation and asked about the wait. She said it would be 40 minutes (which was awesome) and entered my name and telephone # in their system. We went to the bar and waited for our table. Here's where Sunda dropped the ball. An hour later, I went over to find our hostess to inquire about our reservation. She said our table will be ready shortly. After another 20 minutes I went back to our hostess to inqu"
"short version:service: 2salad bar: 2meat:3long version:thank god we had the buy-one-get-one coupon tonight or i would have been seriously pissed. still it was definitely not worth the $100 tip and drink included. the server was ok for the two times that he was at our table the entire night. as a server myself, i can understand being a little weeded and needing to cut back table time to get to everyone, but this was absurd. my brazilian girlfriend was quite disapointed to find no rice and beans at the salad bar which was decrcibed by the server to have every side and vegetable ""known to man."" when he stopped by to see how we were doing i mentioned that i was surprised that there were no rice and beans. he told us that he would go to the kitchen and make it happen. he never re-appeared and n"
"Good menu options, not too far from work. Liked the cocktail menu too (it's not everyday I see a martinez as a house specialty).Food and drinks tasted great, prices were very reasonable for the neighborhood. Will likely be returning again soon."
"My friends and I were whooping up Wicker Park and, Joe, who lives around there, insisted that we stop in for a 1am taco. Now, if you know me, and you probably don't, you know that I am generally averse to trashy late night food, especially late night mexican food. I don't know if its the grease, or the shady characters, or the pain on the following day, but late night isn't usually my thing.That said, la Pasadita put my fears to rest as soon as I took a bite of the most delicious steak taco I have ever tasted. There's nothing trashy about this late night food. The quality of the steak is a lot higher than a lot of other Mexican joints of this size, and the salsa they give you on the side is perfect: just spicy enough.Next time your in WP, definitely stop by Pasadita."
"I've benefited from Yelp reviews for a long time, now it's my turn to pay it forward. First of all, Wakamono is hit or miss. I've had decent dinners there before, tonight was not one of them. ��I ordered the shrimp tempura roll (on special, and now I know why). It tasted bad, and when we tried to send it back the waitress said she wouldn't take it off our bill--that they ""smelled it and the cooks tasted it"" and it was fine. ��Hmm... really? That skeeves me out even more than funky shrimp. �� The waitress' attitude didn't help. ��Sorry Wakamono, you lost one neighbor's business."
"I love to go to Greektown, and Artopolis is my new favorite place. ��Went for lunch (lemon soup & greek salad - amazing) and stayed for the desserts. ��I could make myself sick eating all the amazing baked treats - opera cake and greek coffee are my new weakness. ��Eat here now!"
"What a disappointment. While the service was great, the food was very average - most dishes weren't warm enough and lacked seasoning. Their mashed potatoes and pickled onions were my favorite things though the burger was very good - says a lot for a bbq place. The meats were pretty flavorless (the burger being the exception), the cornbread boring (e.g. compared to Bandera's incredibly delicious cornbread). Pretty decor and a nice place, just wouldn't go back for the food."
"I have been going to Indie for many years now. ��I am not a sushi fan but I eat everything else. ��Rangoons, Thai samosas, Satay, Veggie Egg Rolls, Cucumber Salad, Basil Beef, Classic Fried Rice w/beef, Crazy Basil w/beef, Drunken Noodles with Chicken and on and on and on. Oh and if eating at the restaurant the Fish dishes ROCK!! ��Wouldn't do fish for delivery, it needs to be enjoyed on site. ��The delivery is always prompt, food hot and GENEROUS portions. ��Love Love Love Indie and have tried other places in the neighborhood but none compare. ��Keep Up the great job Indie!!!"
"My favorite place for Belgian beer. ��An incredibly extensive menu of beers, most of which you can't find anywhere else. ��They also have delicious food. ��I recommend the ham sandwich, and it comes with some of the best fries and aioli that I've had."
"Don't Bring the Kids!Went there early on a Saturday night. ?4 adults, 2 kids. ?We were at a table against the wall (which is where we sat the kids). ?Things seemed to be going well, everyone was chatting and the kids were playing with action figures. ?Well...the owner comes over and says, Children, when the trees outside can hear you then you are being too loud. Then he walked away. ?What???Not sure what spurred this comment by the owner because - believe me - we are the first people to be conscious of our kids and to make sure they are behaving. ?Dinner was good, but we weren't even asked if we wanted coffee or dessert. ?How rude! ?The kids were definitely NOT being too loud. ?In fact, everyone in the place was chatty - it wasn't a quiet restaurant.Definitely won't make a return trip."
"When the guy making my falafel sandwich offered to share an aloe drink with me if I didn't want the giant bottle for myself, I knew I was going to like it at Sultan's. I didn't take him up on it, but a much smaller ginger beer and a ��filling and delicious sandwich were just as good. I want to live in this neighborhood just so I can go anytime! The cash only part tripped me up (I try not to carry a lot of it because I spend it WAY more easily than when I use my card) but I'll be sure to carry enough for a falafel if I'm in the area. And luckily, it's so cheap that I shouldn't have a problem doing that!"
"My friend has been raving about this place for ages, so I finally joined him for dinner and was somewhat disappointed. ��We ordered guacamole to start and it was just fair, and the salsa was missing a kick. ��For my entree I got the Onion Steak and I got an Oatmeal shake to drink. ��I have to say, the Oatmeal shake was very good. ��The steak, however, was very greasy and not very tender. ��The onions gave it a good flavor, but the quality was not that exceptional. ��If I lived a few blocks away I might come back in a pinch, but otherwise the only reason I would revisit Irazu would be to get another delicious oatmeal shake."
Yummy steak sandwich and no matter how long it sat on my plate the bread stayed perfectly crunchy on the outside while the steak stayed tender and juicy~~ ��oh man my mouth is watering just thinking about it.
"I really enjoyed the ambiance. The d��cor is very homey, warm, and welcoming. ��Waiting in line for our table (about a 30 minute wait), every dish passing by looked amazing! Good presentation. I truly believe my experience was due to our waitress, Abra. She was SO welcoming! Funny! ��I truly enjoyed her presence. I ordered several things off the menu. I was impressed with 3 of the 5. The other two were Good. I would definitely eat there again. I wish I saved room for dessert because the desserts looked and smelled amazing. I would recommend the Spinach Dip and the Winter Vegetable Soup. Both were marvelous! I know veggie soup, amazing, but it really was! I could have just had that! The only complaint was that one of the gentlemen I was with ordered his burger medium and it came out well done."
"Awesome patio/garden, where they even grow some of their own ingredients. ��I had a servers who was passionate and knowledgable, and another that wasn't very good and had no idea what he was talking about. ��Regardless, the food and wine is REALLY good! ��They even make their own whole wheat bread so I feel healthier about eating 5 pieces before dinner. ��The chef makes things a little too oily and creamy for my taste (health freak) and doesn't, according to our server, appreciate requests for oil-less or healthy substituions in the meals. ��Really good sea food and I love some of the unique dishes like the squid ink pasta. Also fun for people watching."
This place is fabulous.... Brussel sprout salad is the best!
"don't eat hot dogs. they're fattening, unhealthy and filled with god knows what. i mean....well, i deny eating hot dogs. if I make it myself in my kitchen it doesn't count.Hot Doug's is a w e s o m e. i rarely get into this area,but when i do, i like to go here and indulge in fattening unhealthy yumminess.."
"Ok, I'm not the pizza fanatic in my family. ��That distinction goes to my son. ��We stumbled on this place a few years ago and were not all that impressed with the outside--hard to park, small etc. ��But, we were hungry so in we went. ��There were reviews on the walls, tables crammed in a small area, and a line to order -- my rule: 15 minutes and I'm gone. ��Good thing we waited. ��Holy c r _p (!) this was good. ��. . and I'm not all that fussy about pizza and I prefer a Lou Malnati's type of crust, but this I'll go out of my way for. ��My son is the afficianado and he just raved-- ""it's the sauce. . ."". ��There you have it. ��Enough said.They recently expanded so its not so cramped. ��Put this place on your list."
I am a graduate student at DePaul University that rather has any time to unwind. I really let my hair down at the Apple on Saturday. They have the most amazing and diverse characters employed here. The staff was very attentive and I felt like I know them forever. I had 3 amazing drinks; I tried pumkin and sour cherry beer. The bar is classical decorated. It reminds me of the Sugar Shack in New York. There was a great vibe and aura. But the best thing by far was the music. It was a mixture of hip hop and alternative rock.This place is bad ass!
Best Korean bbq and sides! ��I've been a fan for many years now. ��They're always busy but they're open late!
"Great Food, Great Servers, Tons of Beer Choices ��ANDa place to watch Boston Univiersity Hockey (ranked #1 in the Nation)"
OMG!!! ��This place has the best friggin wings!!!!
Wonderful experience. ��Loved the concept and service. ��The owner made time to visit our table despite the restaurant being packed. ��Will definitely be back with a group of friends.
Bin 36 is a great place to get together with friends and family over a great bottle of wine. They have a large wine selection filled with various and unique types of wine. My family and I have different tastes in both food and wine but their extensive menus ensure that everyone will find something they love.
"Best burger in Chicago, fact."
greasy but pretty good
"in a word...delicious..everything was perfect..the food, the presentation, the wine, the host, the waiter, the decor, etc...i smiked from the moment i walked in to the moment i went to bed. so wonderful. looking forward to my next night out there."
"Went there last night at 6 pm and we were seated right away, although they asked us to leave the table by 7:15 for an incoming reservation. That didn't bother me, though - ��I like it when restaurants are respectful of reservations. Food was great! We started with balsamic glazed garlic and ciabatta and it was DELICIOUS! We shared the raw beet salad - yummy! My husband had the pot roast and he really liked it. I had the egg sandwich - it was so heavy and rich that it got kinda goopy. ��The frites were nice, but would be better if they were a little thinner.I had the Pimm's Cup cocktail and it was awesome, while my husband got the $2 glass of PBR. ��We'll be back!"
"Coast is one of the best sushi restaurants in the city. I absolutely love the white dragon roll..outstanding! Also it is BYOB, so it makes it that much better. I have been a fan for several years now, and has always been consistently awesome!"
"I've eaten at Frontera a dozen times.Likes: The Topolo margarita. It is very good, one of my favorites. A bit on the small side for $10 bucks, but it has a great flavor.The chips and dips. Good flavor on both sauces and thick chips. $4 charge once again is a bit steep, especially when other places include them in your meal at no charge.Dislikes:The food always sounds great, the descriptions of the ingredients and plate presentations are very good. The issue I have is the food never tastes as good as it sounds or looks. Don't get me wrong, it has complex flavors and seems to be made with fresh ingredients, but all the dishes seem to lack salt (I am not a salt lover, but you need a touch to bring out flavors) and other times the sauces don't complement the protein ( a dark mole type sauce do"
"The overall atmosphere was good. ��My boyfriend and I went for drinks and dessert. ��We had the smores dessert. ��Honestly, I was not too impressed. ��The drinks were ok, but for the price I don't think I would get them again. ��Let me just put it this way...we went for fries and a beer afterward for a quarter of the price and were much happier. ��For the price, I don't know if this place is all that great. ��I do, however, appreciate that they buy local, organic produce and meat."
"Went there at lunch time on a Tuesday. ��Paid $20 for a Pepito sandwich and a 12 ounce beer (bottle). ��The wait was 15 minutes. ��There is no take out, ��you have to wait for a table. ��At the table I was asked by the hostess if they could seat a stranger at our table of six. ��We had 5 people so I said no. ��She told the people waiting that I said no. ��The sandwich was mediocre, it tasted like an Italian beef but it was mostly bread. ��The bread was crunchy. ��On the plus side, they asked my friend if she had a food allergy because she asked for no beans. ��They made sure to accomodate her. ��They also provide free sparkling water while you wait."
"Lao Sze Chuan seems to be the only restaurant in US that carry real Chinese food, Sze Chuan cuisine of course. All other restaurants carry Americanized Chinese food. It's my favorite and have been there many many years. Their amazing food is real treat to my friends too."
"Great for a quick snack on my walk down Division. I have had there red velvet cupcakes, the are yummy. I have not tried their cakes, but the look nice. The staff is young and very willing to help. Once I experience more of their baked good, I'll update my yelp."
best Greek deserts in Greektown hands down!!!! my wife loves the croissants whit chocolate in them great place!!!
"My girlfriend and I went to Shaw's because i have heard from others that they have the best crab legs in town. We weren't disappointed. Reservations were made for 6pm on a Saturday. We arrived on time and was seated immediately. The concierge offered to check in our coat for us which i thought was a nice touch. I can tell they wanted us to know we'll be taken care of at Shaw's. The waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu, very polite and did a fabulous job. The food was incredible. We both ordered the Alaskan king crab. The sizes of these legs were so huge and delicious. We both felt we have eaten the best crab ever in our lives. I definitely got my moneys worth. Hands down the best in the city, if not the entire Midwest. I highly recommend Shaw's Crab House for its fresh food and excell"
"I'm still not sure I'm that impressed with this place. I moved around the corner about 3 months ago, and I'm constantly seeing lines to get in here on weekend mornings. I'm not sure why. The service isn't friendly, that's for sure and that's a big factor in my return. The menu items are kind of bland I think, so there's no need for me to be waiting in those lines on the weekends. I bet it would be cozy inside during the winter months to have some coffee and read the paper, but I don't see the hype here. I did try the Panini with Hummus, Grilled Zucchini, Roasted Red Pepper, and Spinach the other day and that was pretty decent, but I just feel that they lack in selection. Most of the other sandwiches I have tried here are pretty boring. They lack creativity. They do need friendly service. T"
I give a 5 when I get above expectations. It's not a 5 star but it was great. Don't go to melting pot this is the place for fondue. If you don't want fondue go somewhere else. The wait staff is great and it's a fun atmosphere. We have been to a few five star restaurants in Chicago and we always feel like we spent too much. This one we spent 1/5 of the price and loved the experience....
"So I finally joined Yelp and find myself doubling back to post a long-overdue review for Caro Mio. Back in June, I had organized a large surprise dinner for my girlfriend to celebrate her grad school graduation. The food was great, the service was good, and if my story ended there, I would be giving this place 4 stars. Alas, she and I returned the next evening, having realized that we likely had left flowers and several graduation cards (some, we found out after-the-fact, with money in them) in a gift bag at the restaurant. Upon our return, we discovered that, despite restaurant management having my name and cell phone number from organizing the party, (1) our flowers had been placed in a vase and put on display in the restaurant, and (2) only one card was left, which for reasons unknown, "
"Sunda is a wonderful dining experience for all the senses. We have been there twice and have had great experiences both times. Last time we went on a Tuesday and the place was packed. We walked by several other restaurants in the area and there were very few tables filled. Sunda is doing it right! The atmosphere is upscale, fun, creative, and energized. If you are looking for a quiet place, Sunda may not be for you. The bar area is comfortable with interesting cocktails and my favorite Pinor Noir, A to Z. The staff is friendly and waiters are well versed in the menu and will help you make fabulous choices. The ""No You Didn't"" roll and the cod main course are the best. The menu is heavy meat and fish based. I would love to see a vegan main course choice that isn't sushi. If you are looking "
"A few times I went I was stuck on the appetizer Full Metal jacket because it was so awesome! I recently had a burger with chicken and tuna on it. Forgot what its called But it was so good!!. The burger was HUGE. You can also replace the beef part with turkey chicken or a veggie burger which is what I did. All the people there are really nice. The bartenders are also creative, The only thing keeping them one star off is the price. Its kind of on the expensive side."
Went on a Monday night for a dinner with a group of 15. ��We had a semi private room. ��The waiter was pushy yet entertaining and funny. ��I had a virigin pinacolda with mint which was very good. ��The others had wine and mojitos and they all liked theirs. ��We got two appetizers to share on the table. ��One was the mixed ceviche which was great (except the oyster one) and the other was a shredded beef on fried plantain which was super tasty. We also got some guacamole for everyone and it was extremely good along with the seasoned chips they provided. I got the sea bass and they prepared it blackened style for me. ��Many people had the seafood stew and the steak and loved it. ��The desserts were amazingly yummy. ��We got one sharing dessert which had many things along with a watermelon flavored cot
"This place has been around for many years and has just gotten better and better. The rib eye steak is beefy flavor and great texture. ��The cream spinach and wild mushroom risottos are my favorite sides. ��The servers, Sam, Chris, Rafael, Jose, and Michael and staff, Ahmad, have been great. ��The food I highly recommend and I try to go for lunch there once a week. ��I also like being able to have FRESH fish every day, cooked to perfection. ��Keep up the good work!!"
"All I have to say is I LOVE MEAT! The food here is delicious, and the unlimited servings of meat are incredible. I can stay here for hours dining on meet ��and the waiters are attentive to the temperature you want your meat at. Alittle pricey, but great for special occasions!"
"I have been to India House many times. ��The food and service have always been supurb. ��However, recently I took a friend who was visiting from out of town and was very disappointed. ��The service was good but not great. ��The worst was the chilli chicken masala. ��The dish while very tasty was barely edible because the chicken itself was extremly tough, chewy and dry. We informed the server when he finally returned to our table. He could see that we couldn't even cut the pieces on my plate, so he offered to remake the dish, but at that point we had already waited a very long time for our food in the first place, and then again for the server to come back by our table. We took home the left overs but ended up tossing all the chicken. ��I think for the caliber of restaurant this is and with the "
"We went here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. ?We arrived pretty early (around 6:30) to avoid the rush, but still had to wait a little bit for a table. ?The tables are fairly close together, so luckily the couple at the table next to us weren't loud-talkers. ?For our first drinks, my boyfriend got a Manhattan and I had some kind of pomegranate cocktail; both were good. ?We got beers after that, of which they have a good selection. ?We ordered the frogs legs as our first course. ?They were cooked exactly like buffalo chicken wings, complete with blue cheese sauce, and were kind of disappointing, though they were on the bar bites section of the menu so maybe we should have known better. ? We also ordered the gnuddi and scallops small plates. ?The gnuddi didn't blow me away, but came with "
"Wow! ��My first time at Nana's was this weekend for the pajama brunch. ��Wear your pjs and get a free mimosa...what a concept!The food was AMAZING.I ordered the breakfast burrito and about died it was so good.Fresh ingredients, creative blend of flavors, loved it.The service was excellent.Sunlit tables, bright open design.Although I live in Edgewater, I will certainly make the trek south again for this outstanding restaurant.Veggie friendly.I want to go back for the fixed price dinners."
"Be careful of this place. ��We went for a midweek dinner. ��Even though they had plenty of tables the entire time we were there, we were forced to sit outside between the noisy EL and the smokers next door. ��More troubling was the lack of prices on the fish menu. ��Only the daily special had a price to it, and when we got the bill, they had charged us more than the posted price. ��When I pointed out the discrepancy, they claimed that the clearly posted price was incorrect and refused to change our bill. ��Added to this was the slow service, mediocre food, and a refusal to let us bring our stroller into the restaurant. ��Needless to say, we won't be returning."
"Went back one more time, like I said before stick with Kuma's. This place is trying to hard to copy that. I tried a new burger and was the same as the last time I was there, just nothing special about it. ��What is up with some of the people who hang around here? Not sure if they own the place or they work there but come on. Tried it out two times and that will be it for me. Maybe if this place had super low prices I would say try it out, but this is the city you can find amazing food on any corner don't need to deal with mediocre bar food."
"I love INDIE... have been there since it was a tiny room.... now indie is expanded, ��so I hardly have to wait to be seated anymore. The food is consistently good. I've had both Thai and sushi.I am a traditional sushi eater.. and was suspicious of this thai and sushi place at first... but wow!! the sushi-sashimi is always fresh at a reasonable price. Recently I am now more adventurous and try their tasty and creative rolls ... summer passion is my favorite. They always have ��special rolls, which make each visit more fun... the fun part is to decide if i am going with the special or the one I usually have. The Thai food is great too. Today I decided to go with ��their special, crispy chicken with curry... can't remember the name... but it tastes really really good. I'm excited to see their ne"
"Great food, nice decor and good beer selection. I would like to give you five stars but just a little bit pricey. Other then that if you are looking for a good quick bite to eat, give this place a chance!"
"Best pan pie in Chicago!! Delivery is always on time and service when you are there is good....they are busy, but what do you expect when everyone is craving the burnt cheese crust to melt thier tastebuds! Thank you Pequod's!!"
My favorite restaurant. I crave the vegan gyros several times a week- they get the spices perfect. The staff is always very warm and sweet. And there is always fun people-watching.
"This pizza place is certainly one of the greatest of Chicago. The place is well located, the menu and the variety of the pizzas are very good and the stuffed Pizza is amazing.Another good thing is that you can pick the toppings that you want and if you want to eat different pizzas every time you can !I went there with my family and after that with my girlfriend, and in both occasions we had delicious food with great treatment, so I recommend !"
I couldnt say how much I loved the food and people! The second I sat down I had full service and some of the most amazing cuisine!
"OMG! The food is good, but..............Can they be any more impatient as you sit at a table? ?All they want to do is get you seated and get you out. ?Our server came by 85 times to take our order in the span of two minutes... ?Our busboy came by 100 times as we still had food on the table asking, Are you done yet?Once we finished our food, they asked us 400 times if we wanted anything else AND to check to see if the bill was paid yet.They should change the name of this place to one of these two:Hurry Up, Eat and Get Out!orCan I take that for you?!!!!!Never go again. They should change the name of this"
"I ordered a cheddar burger and clam cowder from Shaw's as i have before. I thought the burger was unusally tough but discovered they had melted the cheese on the burger without removing its wrapping/backing first. I hope the 40% of this burger/wrapping i injested passing through me without making me ill. The delivery service informed Shaw's manager, who offered to redo the order for free and not charge me for this crap, but even though i asked the delivery service to have Shaw's to call me, no one has nor to my knowledge did they apologize. Check your food throughly if you order from here"
"My husband and I went for Valentine's day, ��Usually going out on that night is a nightmare but, our experience at Anti Prima was great. ��They got us right in on time for our resrevation and, the service was fantastic. ��The food was the real show stopper. Everything we ordered was outstanding. ��We will definately be back."
"Just ordered delivery from here since I was craving Pho and I usually get Pho delivered from Hai Yen. However, my past delivery experience was not great. Loved how fresh the food is from here. It's amazing. A lot of Asian restaurants don't use really fresh ingredients, but Simply It does! Also, it was a nice surprise to get complimentary oranges with my order. There was also a letter of thanks from the owner which was really nice. I didn't know they were struggling until I read the letter and checked it out the article on Time Out Chicago. Try Simply It since they deliver. Your food will arrive hot and fresh!"
"I love Mexican food and this Saturday I have a chance to try the relatively new Xoco restaurant in Chicago. The proprietor of Xoco is Chicago's Mexico food guru Rick Bayless who also owns Topolobambo and Frontea Grill. The theme of Xoco is Mexico street food elevated. The restaurant is not very big and has a casual dining atmosphere. My wife and I arrived at about 11:30am and by noon, the line was out the door. The popularity of the restaurant was evident. The wait staff were friendly and efficient. We ordered the following: -a. Shortrib Red Chile Soup (braised tallgrass shortribs, red chile broth, roasted vegetables, epazote, wild arugula, lime).b. Pork Belly Vermicelli (crispy-tender pork belly, toasty-tender noodles, woodland mushrooms, zucchini, avocado, salsa negra).c. Pibil (wood-roa"
"Their Korean food is really good and you will always leave feeling full. There really is something for everyone (even the less adventuresome). If you are looking for fancy, shmancy, Americanized Korean food then this is NOT the place for you. However, if you're looking for the real thing then come here. Nothing fancy. Just good food. Now my reason for 3 stars...the service is pretty terrible, be prepared for typically unfriendly waitstaff who don't like fielding questions from unneducated diners. You get what you get. Also you're better off walking than parking (their lot is impossible) and the 'Sushi' side of their restaurant is less than stellar. Stick with the Korean side and you're golden! What can I say, I'm a sucker for local joints."
"I had to sign up on yelp to write this review for Nana... I am in love with this place, food and family. ��It is great from the moment you walk in. ��Sorry for those who had a bad experience waiting for good food. ��The place is beautiful. ��Food is excellent. ��My server was awesome. ��Thanks for opening up a great tasting organic restaurant... Can someone say Chilaquiles!!!! yummo"
"This place is phenomenal - innovative food, great wines, great service, great ambiance. ��I can highly recommend it, and we go out to nicer restaurants in Chicago frequently.I put on a birthday party dinner for 20 people, and that is usually a lot of work. ��Not here. �� Tenae Graybosh helped coordinate the event and she was absolutely professional, creative and great to work with. ��It was a multi course meal and we had the entire back room, I pre-selected the wines, and we started the event at the bar with some appetizers (roped off in the back for privacy). ��The entire dinner party loved the food (everybody ate too much), the wine selections were a hit, the service was impeccable and that is usually tricky with a group this size, and the Manager Brian that evening was absolutely on his game"
"Went to Mastro's on New Year's Eve with 6 people. ��I carefully went over some food allergies and was assured they would be handled properly. ��Well, they weren't, which led me to getting quite ill.When I called to speak to a manager about it, I got a lot of sympathy and was told the manager would check with the staff and get back to me. ��But she never did, and even avoided me when I called back several days later.This is unacceptable for a restaurant in this price range. ��Not only was my $99 steak - ordered since it supposedly met my allergy needs - overcooked and tasteless, other people at our table had really unacceptable food. ��And then to ignore carefully-explained health needs is inexcusable. ��There are lots of other steak houses in Chicago - Mastro's should be avoided."
"This place definitely has its share of rave-review customers. ��But when I went, I was not too taken aback. ��Though the menu has a lot to offer, I don't think that they had to put in alterna-meats in every dish. Vegetarian food is great, but imitation meat...not so much. ��The food I got was bland and dry and I'm hoping that it was just a fluke. ��I'm willing to give this place another chance--any place that draws in such a loyal following deserves me trying it out for a second meal."
"I'd heard good things about this place, but I'm not a fan. ��I didn't really see the need to pay Brazilian steakhouse prices to feel like I was sitting in a ski lodge. ��A pretty ski lodge, but really. ��The food was ok, and I might have given them that third star if not for the little troll that served us. ��He had quite the little attitude on him. ��All of that wood and what basically amounts to a fancy fire pit may appeal to some, but if I want that I'll go to Colorado."
"Love Love Love this place. Recently moved away from the area but can't help visiting. Everything is great the deli, breakfast, lunch, dinner, their gifts, choice of fresh produce.Would die for one of their red velvet cupcakes right now!OOH and I heard that they are open to midnight now......"
"I have never been to a Giordanos I didn't like. ��The only problem with this one is the wait, but it's just because it's that good. ��Service has alway been good and the pizza has never disappointed. ��This is by far my favorite location and favorite pizza! ��They need to open one in Iowa City, Iowa!"
"EIazu definitely deserves a positive review, despite the fact that I had some REALLY bland food there. I got a dish with tuna, rice, and some veggies. Looked good on the menu, but it was all texture. No flavor whatsoever. BUT I was with a big group of people and received a lot of charity food from their plates. Everything else on that menu rocks. The skirt steak was the definite winner. Service was great. Our server, Amanda, did a great job at accommodating our big group and didn't have a problem taking my meal off the tab. Irazu kicks butt. ��No doubt about it."
"The first impression was very good but after I got the dish the good mood disappeared. ��15,95 Fabu dish - 2 ounces of meat, 10 ounces of bones.The waitress was bored. I wont come back. Nice patio is not enough for good review."
"Love this place! They've only been open one week and I've been back twice! ��A great addition to the neighborhood. ��Well executed simple food and classic cocktails to match. (note: timing on Friday was an issue, they seemed to be feeling the pressure of their first busy night)"
"For all the hype, this place failed to deliver. ��It is also misleading for this to be considered a hot dog place since the hot dog is marginal and they really seemed to be an exotic encased meat purveyor. ��Duck fat fries are not special and I really think that people think they are special because people have told them they should think they are special. ��I think the one time will be probably be the only time."
It's a great place to grab drinks before going out or grabbing food with friends. It's not your typical dead steakhouse. ��The place is full of energy.
"I have considered Bongo Room one of my favorite breakfast restaurants in the Chicago area. In spite of the noise and the fact that it is always packed (esp. the Milwaukee St location), the food is almost always top-notch. But I recently ��did have a bad experience here. The food took over an hour to arrive, even though we were seated about 15 minutes after they opened. In spite of the wait we remained optimistic. Then we got our breakfast: undercooked doughy pancakes, and a (decent) omelet with burned black homefries. Really. Burned black hunk of crust. ��Totally unacceptable. The cook actually hid them under a thin layer of mushy uncrisp potatoes and I did not see them at first. I was so hungry by this time that I just ate the mushy potatoes along with the omelet. When my waitress FINALLY r"
"WORST sushi in Chicago! If you want unfresh seafood that could make you sick, go for it. Otherwise, steer clear because there are far too many great sushi places in Chicago. I am honestly so confused by all of the great reviews. It is disgusting!"
They make perfect otoro.The Crunchy Salad and Duck in eggs are great too
"Oh my goodness.Make no mistake, this is not a fine dining restaurant, this is not even a casual restaurant. It shares more in common with a Quiznos than with the former two categories. That said, it is phenomenal.If you go when it's busy, you're asked to wait in line for a table allocation before ordering. It's worth it. You then order at the counter and get your food in 15 minutes or so at your table. Everything is super fresh and made to order. I can recommend both the Pepito and the Woodland Mushroom. It's interesting to have something on a yeasted bread that tastes Mexican, but it makes me want to go to Mexico again.After our delicious dinner, we had some churros, ice cream (with a delicious praline that included bacon, yes, bacon), caf�� con leche, and melted chocolate mixed with almon"
All fondue lovers must try Geja's! It's a very romantic restaurant and the food is delicious! I just went there the first week in July for their anniversary sale...they do this every year and this year everything was 41% off since they've been around for 41 years now.
"Bartenders are outstanding, decor and staff are outstanding, valet service is outstanding and fairly well priced at 12$. ��Steak... specifically the rib eye is redonkulous. ��Creamed spinish is rich and an outstanding shade of bitter in a good way, very earthy.I will go here a few times a year until the butter covered steaks kill me."
Not sure how anyone could not like Tru. I've been there a few times now and I always get the chef's choice because I figure Im already splurging by coming here so I may as well splurge all the way. ?I can't say whether the presentation or the food is better because both are top notch- it doesn't get any better than Tru.
"I am a meat lover so every a few months I would go to this place to treat myself with a satisfying meal. Their free cheese bread are delicious. I like their house special steak which is very juicy and tender. They provide salt and pepper on the table but I wish they could provide some sause as well, such as the A1."
This is one of my favorite places! ��The mussels are so good; they are so large I think they may be on steroids. ��The mac and cheese is to die for and the steak is always made to perfection. ��I'm always impressed with the service. ��They are very attentive and friendly. ��They have a happy hour menu during the week too!
"This was the most amazing dining experience I have ever had. ��First and foremost the food was mind blowing fantastic. ��The music was exactly my style, but a bit too loud. ��The best part of the evening was when the chef came out with a huge box of fireworks and all the diners followed him out of the restaurant where he proceeded to blow them up just off the side street off of Ashland. ��It was a beautiful display that was sadly interrupted by the cops who hauled the chef away to the station! ��The rest of us went back into the restaurant and finished our meals. ��We were assured by the rest of the restaurant staff that they would be going to the station to bail him out. ��I have been fortunate enough in my life to dine at world class restaurants - but Schwa is probably the best restaurant I hav"
"Probably will be kicked out of chicago for this but... Saturday brunch... 1.5 hour wait, lousy tasteless guacamole with chewy chips, cold, mostly raw steak tacos, and a price that would have bought 15 burritos at chipotle. Maybe a bad day but wont go back"
"So I've been out of town for a few weeks doing some traveling over seas , seeing some family etc . I bragged about this place to family and friends because I came here right before I left and wrote a nice review about it . Well I went back. The night started off alright , busy as usual fast paced and it took a minute to be seated which I totally understand . Once we were seated the service staff was amazing and very attentive again like I remembered but there was a new element . It started about a third into the meal and a manager came up , he said his name was John . He asked us how our service was and we told him . Normal right? Heres where it gets a bit strange . He came back SIX times and asked us how service was . Each time we told him it was fine but he kept persisting , as if he was"
"The food is as good as I was expecting. I wish the apps were a bit more creative than just simple seafood. Its a place to see and be seen for sure but its just like all the other steakhouses in Chicago. From the pretzel rolls in the breadbasket to the shrimp cocktail(dry ice doesnt make it better), traditional sides and typical cuts of beef Its a place to see and be seen for now but its just like all the other steakhouses in Chicago......but 30% more expensive than the rest. I think if this City wasnt already packed with outstanding steakhouses this would be the place to be but ��theres nothing at Mastros to bring me back. Also, I like that the steak comes on a 400 degree plate to keep it warm but please dont hand it directly to me......put it down and slide it over.Lobster Mashed Potatos a"
"Our server was great. The food sub-par.....way oversalted or very fatty. Nothing we got was ��""great."" The worst part of the meal was when we were served RAW CHICKEN. I pointed it out to my husband and he thought it was salmon...that's how undercooked it was....but TOO LATE-he had already ate it. While the ""chef' served it to us, he accidentally dropped the piece from his skewer onto the table and USED HIS HAND TO PICK IT UP AND PUT IT ON MY PLATE. Eww. The apology we got for the raw chickem (which, by the way, it super dangerous) was the sous chef coming to our table and saying, ""Next time you come in, we'll serve you champagne."" No thanks. There won't be a next time."
"The seafood crab combination dinner we had for 2 was good, not great. Bad judgmental service is what this is about. Might have been luck of the draw, and maybe the other servers are nicer. And maybe you'd have a better experience if you plan ahead to make reservations. Either way I don't appreciate judgmental service though.  My bf and I sat in the bar table area since we did not have reservations. The waiter was initially average. I am not a very high maintenance person, so usually even average service will buy you a good tip. ?We don't drink, so just asked for water. The table next to us immediately ordered a number of drinks and appetizers. We could hear a totally different tone of the waiter with this couple. He returns to ask if want an appetizer, which we tell him to give us more tim"
"We've been going to Frontera for over 20 years now and we've seen a definite decline. ?My brother, who's also a frequent visitor, has seen the same. ?The food is still good, but the service is lacking. ?It's as if they outsourced they're entire staff to save money. ?Example: ?Our server did not attend to us until we'd been there for over 10 minutes. ?I tried to get the attention of the seating hostess, but she was busy carrying on with one of the other staff members. ?Once our server did show up, his accent was so thick that we could barely understand him. ?Nice to have authentic pronunciation of the dishes, but this was over the top. ?The rest of the service was much of the same - slow and late. ?Furthermore, the assistance server placed the dishes in front of the wrong people - like Denn"
"Ridiculously expensive. The food was good, the service was good, not great, and I don't like feeling ripped off. The staff must be laughing at the clientele for wasting so much money."
"CB&J, Garlic Mayo for ��the Frits (Fries), and Bourbon County when they have it....mmmmm....Patio and up stairs are nice too."
"I really, really wanted to like this place.....but it just didn't happen. ?The staff was great but that was the highpoint of our meal. ?Had the guacamole and a vegetarian burrito, which the menu says is award winning. ?All the food was BLAND! ?The burrito was dry and way too starchy with no real flavor and, though the portion of guacamole was very generous which is usually a welcom thing, we left a lot behind. ?Just not worth eating!"
Wonderful! I will come back here with my friends.
"This place is sooo yummy. My boyfriend is from Iran, and he decided to take me there to try the fare. I've never had a bad experience here. He, of course, says his mother makes it better, but the food is sooo good. I could really eat here any day."
horrible service. period.
Best stuffed pizza in the Chicago land area!! Highly recommend!! :)
"This is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in Chicago. ��My wife and I can only afford to eat here on rare celebratory occasions, but it is a treat. ��Last time I tried the cornish hen. ��Let me tell you - I thought there was a limit on how good chicken could be. ��I was wrong. ��My wife had the lamb chops, which were also delicious, as was the gnudi (like gnochi, but better!)."
"this place is great...but i guess next door is better...the restaurant is very nice 1 star for that but i just felt bad for the server coz she only one tackling all the tables... i know how it is when there's only one you and you have to deal with more than 30 customers...so i have nothing against the service...however, food wise, it's not bad but maybe just coz i tried some other thai restaurant i wasnt too excited about the taste at all... maybe if i pick something else next time i will give them 4 stars or even 5 stars, maybe i didnt like what i ordered ...i will give it another try...ill say next week."
"The only reason I didnt give Sunda a better review is because of the atmosphere. I went there with one other person and we were seated at a very small table at the end of the row next to the bar. The place was so crowded there wasn't enough room for people who were waiting for a table to wait at the bar, so they ��spilled over into the restaurant area. I didn't enjoy having dinner with people standing over us breathing down into our plates."
"Great BBQ, incredible deal on noodle soups. ��Peking duck I can't wait to try, but don't generally go with more than 1 other, and sort of need more people for that. ��Don't bother with the standard Chinese dishes - they're fine, but nothing special."
"This was by far the best korean bbq I've ever eaten! ��The real coals do amazing things for the flavor, and it's sure a step up from gas grills. ��The servers were super nice and even showed us how to roll it up in the lettuce. ��It was a great meal, and a great time."
"We went here on a whim, last minute no reservations. ��After hearing about this place from friends and family, I was very excited to try the food. ��The experience overall was very nice especially the service; however, the food was good not amazing! ��Notables: hot chocolate shot - seriously rich and deep in flavor but not too overpowering coconut macroon - very sweet but not the kind that hurts your teeth.homemade chocolates - also very rich and intense in flavorpretty much anything dessert!The savory dishes although tasty were not very innovative. ��Of all the savory dishes, my favorite was the beef wrapped in proscuitto and the soy sauce they used for the sashimi (I swear it's different then the one I have at home- and I'm Asian! haha). ��Overall, a great experience with the ambiance and tim"
I went in here with a buddy of mine that is in the US Army (uniformed on this occasion). ��Doug wouldn't accept any more than $5 for a $20 meal. ��Doug is a class act. ��The food..... unbelievably good! ��One of Chicago's best experiences.
Ate here on the Chicago Pizza Tours and it was my favorite. Had never been a fan of chicago style deep dish with the sauce on the top until I had it here.
This is my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago. ��I love almost everything in the menu. ��My favorite dish is Grilled Calamari... Wow... the best.... I am not a bread pudding fan but here ��I have to say it is the best.
"The food here is really good, I could not believe the size of the wings. ��I got the Big Budda Bowl with beef and left feeling full. ��I wish they were open seven days and later. ��I can't wait to try everything else. ��They need to deliver, in case people are to lazy to walk over there."
"Love it, if I weren't eating in a public place I would've folded that pizza in half and eaten it like a taco! ��Love, love, love this place! Fresh, simple, and delicious. ��It's also kid friendly! Kids are too busy eating to fuzz. ��Service is also great. Waitstaff is very friendly."
"texas de brazil has some of the best food i have had the privelege of tasting. all the meats served were piping hot, and succulent almost to a fault. our waiter was terrificly attentive, with our beverage glasses never reaching below half full. this was quite a feat as it seemed quite busy for a monday evening. the man who seemed to be the manager greeted us warmly and saw to it that we were brought the cuts of meat we wanted to re-taste, and the gauchos (meat servers) were more than happy to oblige. the building itself was probably the classiest place i have ever been, with an entire wall dedicated to wine and a trapeze-artist type lady gliding up the wall to grab wine selections. also, all of the furniture was fabulous yet functional. a silly thing did catch my eye, however. i was told t"
"Owned by the cheesecake factory, we had a much better experience here than at cheesecake factory. Portion sizes are huge, prices are the same, but the food tasted better, the staff was much more pleasant, and seemed much more kid friendly. We had a two and four year old. ��While the staff at cheesecake factory seemed annoyed that we would bring kids. ��Mind you we went to the grand lux on a wednesday night. ��We sat right down and had a very pleasant experience."
One of my favorite spots in the city. ��Just went back the other night for the first time in a year because I moved oout of the neighborhood. ��The people are so friendly and the food is always great. ��I always get one of their veal dishes... very reasonably priced too.
"Do you guys know what a capacity is? Please do yourself a favor and keep it to your capacity. Your customers will have a better time and they may even get a chance to spend some money at your establishment. You pack the place way too tight! The bartenders are slower then dirt anyways. The guy i was with was standing at the bar for almost 15 minutes.....HE'S 6 FEET 5 INCHES!!!! How do you miss a guy that big? Here's a tip for your bartenders and management - serve everyone, not just your regulars and keep your business at it's capacity.If you worked as hard on getting good bartenders in there as you do on changing your beer list, you'd have a great place!"
"I went to Sunda last Thursday for one of the ""tastings"" before the restaurant opened to the public and I was really impressed with the restaurant on its opening night. Usually it takes a few weeks to work out the kinks, but the servers were pretty knowledgeable. They only had a limited menu when we were there but we got to sample tons of dishes. It's a really good place if you like Asian food but not necessarily sushi - they have tons of other options if you don't like raw fish.I think this place is going to be the new ""Japonais"" and the trendy vibe/menu is on par with places like Koi, Nobu or Tao. I will definitely be returning!"
"This is a terrific Lincoln Park restaurant! ��The food is amazing, and the ingredients are always extremely fresh. ��I love the salmon noodles, tofu spring rolls, avocado/cream cheese wonton, king crab pasta and pho. �� The restaurant is BYOB, and there is no corkage fee. ��The owner is a wonderful host who welcomes his customers with great warmth and enthusiasm.I love this place!!!"
"Great food like Beignets, Cafe du Monde coffee, scone mix, potstickers, fresh sushi grade tuna but great food comes with a price! ��They do have free valet with a minimum purchase."
"Traditional italian restaurant with great atmosphere, huge portions of meals for a decent price, fast service, great for birthday parties."
"Our favorite place for a great breakfast/brunch on the weekend. ��They have great food and their specials keep regulars like us satisified with something new to try every time. ��They open at 6:30am and with an infant we're up anyway and it lets us get our day started in a great way. ��As long as you get there before 8:30am the wait is none to minimal. ��For us it's right up there with Bongo room, but much more convienent."
"Food was good but the 5 days of food poisoning that ended with a rectal exam, 2 antibiotics and a probiotic were seriously not good. I;m not kidding either"
"Went here with the wife for our anniversary dinner. ��It wasn't bad, but not spectacular. ��Our waiter was great, he gets 5 stars! ��However, the food was ehh. ��Or at least the side dishes were, my wife had the house specialty potatoes and we cant remember the name of them, they were not good. ��The steak was good and so was my crabcake. ��I think I can find better steak house than this one."
"I can understand the appeal of this place, but I will always choose good food over big portions. This place is about big portions and not much else. We shared a skillet and their strawberry and banana french toast. He got coffee. I got an earl grey tea. Let's start with the tea - it was the most bland, un-fragrant earl grey I've ever had. Really disappointing given how good earl grey tea should taste. But I won't give them too much crap for their tea. It's tea, after all. Their skillet was about the size of my head, which was amusing at first. First bite: there's something funny about this egg. Second bite: this egg tastes like it's laced with metal. Didn't have much more of that. The french toast: they used challah bread and provided real maple syrup, which should have made just about any"
"This place was recommended to me by a foodie wine and condiment establishment down the street. I'm only judging Opart by one takeout of phad thai which is not a good enough standard to judge by so this judgement is more about the transaction. Otherwise, Thai is my favorite and I try a variety of dishes in Thai places around Chicago, NYC and Seattle (and stayed in Thailand for 3 months up and down the country). When I ordered the takeout of veggie phad thai, the guy said $9.54. I paid that without really thinking. Then while waiting for the food, I looked at the menu and it said phad thai was $6.54. When the food came, the receipt said it was $8.54. So maybe I paid $8.54 and he just mistakenly said $9.54. I had already put the jumble of change in my wallet and didn't look back at how much h"
"This is one of the best Italian restaurants in the City. ��The wait is well worth it when you taste the food and experience the great service. ��The atmosphere is upbeat and the outdoor seating is great in the summer. ��pasta dishes were fresh and homeade, pizza is very tasty. ��I have visited piccolo many times and would reccommend it to anyone looking for a great experience!"
"Coming from the Bay Area, neck high in Pho restaurants, I was desperately searching for a Pho fix. Luckily I found Simply it. ��The Pho is good (beef is better than its chicken) and they delivery ($3 charge) to pretty far distances. ��I live near the Water Tower and they're up in Lincoln Park. ��The owner Tuan is incredibly nice and energetic. ��He really care's about providing a good product and great customer service. Their Beef Pasta (Bun Bo Xao) is great and its a lunch special. ��Check out their lunch specials first for a good introductory. ��Oh, and their Fisherman's Soup is good too (don't let the name deter you). ��Best and only Pho in downtown Chicago ... I've been incredibly satisfied every time! ��Bon appetite!"
"Best quick falafel, schwarma and hummus you will find on the near northside of ��Chicago. �� The prices are ridiculously cheap. ��You could eat EASILY for two lunches for under 10 bucks. ��Haven't tried the kabobs yet but that's next on my list after I get over my schwarma, rice, and hummus lunch special fix. �� ��Love it."
"Simply breath-taking scenery, and the food was really great. I ordered the baby back ribs with a side of chicken, and that alone was way too much for me to finish. There's definitely enough and if you have room for dessert, the options are amazing. The martini samplers were exceptional, and would recommend to anyone with a party of friends. This restaurant and its service was great, and I'm definitely looking forward to going there again."
"Definitely enjoyed my trip to Nuevo Leon! I love that they serve a little appetizer with the chips and salsa. This time I was given a delicious bean and meat concoction on a plate with a warm tortilla on top. It was both delicious and I was super starving so I was ready to lick my plate and my friends by the end of it! Our food took a little longer than others around us to come out but I'm thinking it may have been because my friend ordered the fajitas combination. I had a few bites of his food and I loved it! I took his leftovers of the onions and peppers and have already decided that's what I will get next time! I ordered chicken enchiladas suizas with green tomatillo sauce. It was also delicious! I'm definitely obsessed with their refried beans! The guacamole was a little bland, I added"
"Went for dinner last night and must say was very much impressed. Sat on patio with girlfriend under the trees and lights and felt like we could have been in our own backyard. Our waiter Mark was awesome,he was more old school then the mono toned no personality servers I have had way to many times before. Was very professional and there when ever we needed anything. He appeared at just the time we need more wine, was not intrusive and had a funny and great personality. He also had fun with all the support staff that assisted which was nice to see. And the food ,well it was probably the best I have had in Chicago. Girlfriend had the straccy? and I had the sea bass.Appetizer of antipasto was awesome. Will definitely be back and soon and cant wait to tell friends and family.Thanks Piccolo Sogn"
"I've just moved to Lincoln Park, IL ��a few months ago, I've tried a few Vietnamese places around here and I can simply say that this place is bang for your buck. ��The owner will personally greet you and treat you. The quality is much better than places by Broadway and Argyles.Check it out!Oh, prices are fair."
Glenn's is great service with great food and the seafood is fresh and not over seasoned. Oysters and Lobster Roll is off the chain.
"Mercat is a cool place with interesting food. The tapas are unique, well done and expensive. The restaurant itself is a large circular room with a high ceiling. It is located off the lobby in a classic old hotel on south Michigan Ave. The place has a distinctly chic urban vibe. Overall a very good experience."
"Not sure why my review wasn't posted, but I like this place so much I wanted to repost it."
"It's great to have a place to go to that has really great food that is reasonably priced and really well prepared (yes, the talent in the kitchen does make a difference).The place is interesting, casual, relaxing, pretty. ��You can tell by the freshness that the product they use is high quality. The first time I walked into Gilt Bar, ��I settled in and wanted to stay forever, The sofas, the lighting, the music (really interesting but not so loud you can't talk to each other), the cocktails ��(my favorite right now is Death's Door Daisy), the beers, (I love the Belgium one, the duchess de bourgogne), and the food (the next thing I try seems to be my favorite).When we finally left, it was only to come back. ��I've been there three times already and have read some of the reviews and wanted to sha"
"This place has great decor, and very nice concept. ��Food was definitely very good. ��My three stars are because of stuck up hostess and non- caring managers. We were greeted by no smile and were left to stand there for 40 minutes where there were so many tables available. I'll go back if someone else is treating me. Until then not so much."
"Now this is good southern cooking. After failing miserably to find some good southern food (see review of Dixi's Kitchen and Bait Shop. The Worst!) we heard about Big Jones. It's much closer and much much better. We have been twice now and everything is always great. The service, the cocktails, the food and even the owners are great. When we arrived there was a bit of a wait, no problem, but the owner (I assume) was so apologetic. We were seated and our server was at our table quickly. He was very attentive, professional and friendly. I ordered a mint jullip that was tasty and strong. The warm corn bread with butter and honey was delicious. We decided to try frog legs for the first time. They were good and meaty and not fried just right. We shared the jumblia and the chicken special of the"
"La Pasadita is. The. Shit. If you enjoy steak in a tortilla, there is no other in Chicago like this. Steak and cliantro. What else do you need in a burrito? Sure you could spice it up with rice, beans, veggies, and other good items. But, if you really just want a steak burrito, these guys have it down. I live across the street and the grill smoke wafts into my window and smells delicious constantly. It's kinda funny that there are three locations. all right next to each other. One is a sit down Mexican food place with a mid sized menu of your normal menu. The other two serve beef in a couple forms and that is it.Enjoy."
"YUM YUM YUM...ive been going to opart thai for about 8 years now and i love it there. ��its cozy, the food is always rockingand the service (even though they do get really busy sometimes) is friendly and fun. ��i have to mention that i see yuppies going in there and complaining (while their baby is crying) that their food is taking a little long. ��i want everyone who reads this review to realize that its a small joint and there are only a couple of servers there, which is perfectly fine for such a place. ��i love their dumplings, pad kraw prow and their curry...YUM"
This is the exact reason I do not go to Chicago bars!! ��Way to stuffy for me!! ��Not going to try and be someone I am not. ��Being made to feel comfortable and welcome in your surroundings is very important so this is not the place to be made to feel comfortable. ��I really do get what they are trying to do but it's to extreme. To snobbish for me.
The pastries at Alliance are the best in town. The tarts taste as good as they look. Definitely not for anyone on a diet! The coffee is Starbucks quality.
simple delicious pizza.chill enviroment.what else can a girl ask for?
"The food was tasty but the portions were not worth the price at all.The server did not return change even though it was obviously more than double (almost triple) what an expected tip would be..and then was almost impossible to flag down.When we left, I noticed they were moving to clear our table immediately. ��Not surprising given that there was only two or three other tables in there, but when I returned the next day to retrieve sunglasses I had left on the table I was told no one had found them even though they were right on the table and they were clearing before we were through the door.While portion size is not enough to merit such a poor review, that combined with the shady staff behavior means I will not be returning."
"My rule of thumb is to visit a place at least 3 times before making a judgement, so after my fifth visit here, I feel like I can say with some authority that this place is definitely worth checking out. ��I'm a cheese fanatic, and with 50+ cheeses to choose from...I'm hooked. ��Goat cheese crusted in cocoa oil??? ��Super yummy. ��Cheddar cheese rolled in espresso and lavender....amazing. ��It's not just the cheese that I'm enamored with, of course the wine is a centerpiece as well, the food is great, and I've had nothing but great service so far. ��I like that you can come for the lighter fare of cheese & wine in the tavern, but can also have the full dining experience in the cellar. ��Both are great options."
"After a long wait for the next best restaurant in Little Italy to open, it finally did! ��The tired La Vita restaurant was transformed into a comfortable, rustic, cozy eatery - Davanti Enoteca! ��The energy is high, as its staff is eager to please and the chef is making a hit with his creations! ��Being a party of four, we were able to have an array of Italian fare.We started with 2 1/3 liters of their house selections (a white & a red), and perused their wall of wines, set at retail prices. ��A novel idea, that is sure to catch the attention of many....picking out your own wine at a great price, with a nominal corkage fee. ��What a time & money saver for the consumer.Now, for the food! ��MMMMMM......We had an assorted cheese platter, which was very good, but very similar in taste to each other."
"From the first step to the last, Alinea is a must for educated foodies...The service was absolutely perfect and the food was mind bending!  If you have the time and money, treat yourself to the 24 course wine pairing. ��This is the place you imagine taking people that you would love to impress...I went with three very solid chefs and we were blown away by the food, wine and service. We went to L20 the next night and were soooo disappointed I thought two of the three guys were going to walk out! ��Do not waste your time or money on L20. ��Go to Alinea and get a true memoriable experience!"
I love this place. ��The food is outstanding but not overly-priced. ��Plus you will have fun eating here.
"What can I say that hasn't been said already? Got there when it opened and waited in line for 45 minutes and it was well worth the wait! The duck fat fries are the richest thing I've ever eaten.Amazing, amazing food. I live outside of the Chicago area and I'll be back to Hot Doug's whenever I'm in Chicago for the rest of my life."
"Great cuban food. ��Great staff and very efficient customer service. I'm a stickler for good food and how well the wait staff treat the customer, ��Bigger deal is how the managers treat their staff, ��Makes for a very relaxing and respectful place. Highly recommend,"
"The food here is good but both times I've been in, I have had terrible service. ��I would not choose to go back in for in person dining but would get something to go or for delivery."
"Going to Lockdown before the Blackhawks game has become a tradition for us! Every chance I get, I bring friends to the place and they leave happy! The food is incredible, the atmosphere is great and there is always something fun going on there to enjoy (from a suburban person visiting the city that is!)The burgers are out of this world, the steak sandwich is phenom, and the salads are amazing. Even with all that said, the Macaroni and Cheese is out of this world!Look forward to every chance I get to go down there and eat- makes the crappy 1.5 hour commute worth the wait! Keep up the great job and I look forward to the expansion! Hawks winning the game makes for a perfect dessert too! See lots of hawks fans in the place beofre games too which is nice!"
"I just don't get this place. ��I will say that the wine flights are great and I really enjoy the whole concept behind them, but the food is horrible.Miniscule cheese flight, dry skate and rubbery ravioli. ��The only thing we enjoyed was the flat bread pizza and who can really get that wrong?Overrated, over-priced, over it."
"started off nicely but ended terribly ;-( ��we got the right soup but menu didn't specify that it had the one ingredient we didn't want. ��we got another soup which was worse than the first soup and to top it off they won't take it off the bill. ��it only gets worse... the fillet of sole had a million eggs ....YUK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and we discovered this only because we ""tried to communicate"" to the innocent waitress to fillet the fish. �� only after a few times did she understand what we were asking her to do. bad experience. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time at this place. You're better off going to TANK Noodle right around the corner."
"snugged into a cosy little corner next to its cousins frontera and topolobampo, xoco is gourmet sandwiches at its best. i have been there more than once and have always come out impressed. the chicken tinga, gunthorp chicken, the pozole bowl and even the desserts are of very high quality. my only problem with the place is that it is totally packed during peak hours so it is hard to find a place to sit. however, i guess thats just the price you have to pay for a great sandwich."
Great atmosphere and great service all around. My family and I were pampered right from the beginning. David Marrero and Sergio Aguirre were definitely on top of the ball that day. These guys went above and beyond to get things done. All the things I asked for were taken care of in a flash. Excellent job guys. Ronald B.
"My husband and I have been a fan of this place since it opened. ��Back then it wasn't as busy and service was nop notch. ��The food is still great, but the service has slipped a little."
"Wow, just threw away the food I had delivered We ordered two burgers medium rare; they were well done. Further, we got two items that were frankly unidentifiable. The ��meat was certainly not 100% beef. The burgers resembled soy. The only flavor came from the onion on the burger. Disgusting! The burgers were served with way-too-greasy fries and coleslaw I couldn't eat because we didn't get silverware. No napkins either. Have you no pride in your product, La Villa? Will never order from them again. Yuck."
"Pros- Best chicago pizza hands down. Everything on the menu is tasty.Cons- Mark (bald manager) is a perv. The way he looks, talks, touches the little phone girls there is creepy. Enough said."
"We went to this restaurant this past week and were pleased. Like many others, we had heard mixed reviews ranging from ""tries too hard"" to ""inventive."" After a lengthy dinner I'm some where in between, but would definitely recommend people go and see for themselves. The atmosphere was wonderful and the bartender extremely personal. We tried signature drinks and they were worth the price. The waiter bordered on slightly obnoxious, but we let that go. The starter popcorn with truffle oil was amazing. We had two appetizers. The beef tar tar was standard fare with little special about it. The kung pow sweet breads, however, were incredibly flavorful with a much appreciated playful addition of peanut brittle. For main ��courses we had the halibut, which was beautifully cooked and flavored and the"
"Pequod's Pizza is what is served in heaven. ?This to me is the best pizza in the city. ?Plus, as a lonely jew on Christmas it is open...and it has become a tradition for my wife and I to get Pequod's every Christmas. ?We get a half pepperoni half green pepper and onion and before I eat it I like to stare at it for a few minutes, sort of like the same feeling I had the first time I saw Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts in Can't Hardly Wait...very similar experiences for me."
"Yes I am a fan of this place, well I am a fan of the deserts! ��Cute neighborhood, the owner is very nice and you can usually see him talking to the patrons, (I like that)."
"The food was good enough and the pizza we split was delicious, however the service was among the WORST we had ever had. ��The waiter had an attitude from the moment we sat down and was disgruntled to see we had brought our own bottle of wine. ��Really? ��Why the attitude when you charge a $15 corkage fee? ��I suppose this was the reason why the waiter refused to return to our table ONCE to fill our glasses. ��Once the food arrived, the waiter disappeared for 20 minutes. ��Good thing they have much more attentive bussers who were able to assist us. Long and short, the food is not nearly great enough to overcome poor, unattentive service. ��Fortunately, we have many great Italian restaurants in this town to go back to!"
My husband and I dined there 11-11-11. It was everything we expected it to be. We ordered alacarte and still received extra tasting items @ no additional charge. It was truly a fine dining experience!! The food was outstanding and we left feeling full.
"Great breakfast spot. It's always busy but the wait never seems to be too long. I would recommend getting their strawberry-orange juice, it's always fresh and delicious. The food is great. I have liked everything I've tried but am a fan of the eggs benedict and the tour de France, which comes with three different types of french toast. They also offer other food for if you aren't in a breakfast mood. The service is pretty good most of the time, however, they can get pretty busy so it's best to try to order right away."
"Amazing food and bad service. I guess it IS Mother's day, but we were one of two groups in the restaurant when we ordered one meal and it took almost 30 minutes to reach us. I know they make it quickly-- I've grubhubbed them before and it was freaky fast!"
"My girlfriend made me go with her to this place. ��I ordered Mega Roll buddha, which was delicious. ��Overall, I like this place, but not impressed to the fullest, as my girlfriend is. ��She is odd like that."
"I don't have much to say, besides I'm a foodie - and this is the best italian food I've ever tasted. The La Villa special pizza and veal dishes both highly recommended. The staff is friendlier than I imagined any staff could be. Coming to La Villa is like a family dinner - minus the the family members you can't stand."
"Considering our expectations, this restaurant was dissappointing. There is a waiting line (probably because the restaurant doesn't take reservations and the venue is quite small), but that was doable.The waiter was very personable but the service was slow since he had a lot of tables to wait on. We started the evening with margaritas, which were good, small and pricey ($9.00 each). ?We ordered the grand seafood appetizer which had some pretty tasty components as well as middle of the road components.The entrees were bad. We ordered the Carne Assada which is their signature entree and had to send it back because it was so tough. The others ordered other entrees which were good, but fell short of our expectations. No one took doggie bags home.This is a cute restaurant if you are in town and "
We've frequented Calo since it's conveniently located right around the block from where we live. I've got to say their bread is phenomenal! Their baby back ribs are oh so yummy!! and their buffalo calamari is exquisite.. Will return again and again for their calamari!!! :D4 Stars due to pricy options for ok food ...
"I dined at RJ Grunts after the Zoo Lights and it was great! We had a party of 11, which is really big for such a small restaurant, so we put our name in and then wandered through the lights. About an hour later they were able to fit us at two separate tables, which was fine since we had an adult table and kids table. Everyone loved their food and the portions are HUGE so come hungry! They also have a fantastic salad bar, I am not usually one for ordering salads at restaurants, but it looked too good to resist! Service was great, food was great, and atmosphere is fun for the family!"
"overhyped, service is slow. great fries!Jim's originial near UIC is much better in my opinion."
"Chicago is known for it's great live music scene, and one of the greatest venues around is the Green Mill. On weekends it's open late....I mean waaaaay late, 5am on Saturdays. The prices are pretty average and the clientele is a mixed bag of young and old hipsters, hepcats, yuppies, geeks, freaks, punks, jocks, anybody who digs a laid back atmosphere and the best live music in the city really.What's super hip is the circular booths towards the entrance, and the table/dance area right in front of the stage. So whether you're looking to converse with some great background sound, or get right in the mix, there's accomidations for you.The only downside is that it fills up pretty quickly on weekends, so get there before midnight if you want to catch a table, or else you'll be forced to stand at"
Best southern food north of new Orleans. ��Delicious food with service that can't be beat.
"The best authentic Italian pizza in the city, I love this place!"
"My wife and I travel to Chicago several times per year. About two months ago, we were walking through downtown. Around 10:00, we wanted a late dinner. We saw Ruth Chris and decided to give it a try. Even at this late hour, the place was packed. ��We were greeted by a very friendly young lady who seated us at the bar promptly. It is hard not to be impressed by the interior design and architecture of this place. It is truly stunning.Our Bartender was an extremely pleasant young man in his upper 30's with ��curly hair. We ordered a couple of drinks, a seafood appetizer and our entrees. ��I ate the seafood; and was excellent. The bartender and I talked about how it was prepared - similar to his family recipe... (Joe is his name) ��Joe kept us on our toes with funny stories and nice compliments- I "
I used to live right down the street from good old Glenn's. Nothing like tasty diner food to brighten up gray Chicago. The Reuben is awesome! the salads are good and the Seafood specials are pretty good too. Can't complain! it's a nice place in the neighborhood to go! ��If and when it's nice and sunny sitting outside on the patio is very nice and they even let me tie my dog to the fence and brought him water! Big plus!I actually Miss it now that I moved back to California.
"Food was delicious, I tried some new entrees that I have never tried before, but thought it was on the little pricey side. Other than that I would definitely like to come back next time I am in town."
"Everything about this place is warm and inviting. ?I didn't have time for dinner, so I had a few drinks while lounging on the dark tufted leather banquets. ?The Corpse Reviver was one of the best drinks I have ever had, citrusy layered flavor that really brings your palate to life. ?The drinks are made with care, so for anyone complaining about time realize that each drink is made with exceptional ingredients and is likely going to be like nothing you have had before. ?Five minutes isn't a lot to ask when they make your sour to order. ?The atmosphere is one of Gilt Bar's best qualities. ?The staff is a community. ?You can feel and see the pride, cooperation, and knowledge at work, from the bartender explaining what decade your next drink originated, to the charismatic cook running your nex"
"It's only appropriate to make this wonderful beer nurd's haven my first review. Being constantly surrounded by vino, its nice to give your wallet and brain a rest and go for the more approachable suds. What better place to do that than the Hopleaf? I have been here numerous times with numerous different people, and enjoyed myself every time. The appeal, as the name obviously suggests, is beer. More specifically, Belgian beer. Hands down, the best selection of the stuff in Chicago. I pride myself on trying something different every time I go, and I have been a lot. However, the last time I went, I went for literally, The Champagne of Beer. No, not Miller High Life. Malhuer, methode champainoise Dark Brut. A $45 bottle of 12% deliciousness that is so balanced, you will have no idea you are g"
"Pretty decent food and atmosphere. ��I went there on a date and it was nice to have a fancy place to get to know someone. ��The services is really good as well. ��It is expensive given that it is more of an upscale place and I found the food to be good, but maybe not as good as what I paid for. ��They have a great wine selection and the bread that you get with dinner was delicious."
"I signed up here for the sole purpose of yelping about this place (i'm sure there will be others, but you get the idea).I have reservations and you make me wait 25 mins when there are 15 empty tables? Why? Did you think I wasn't going to notice them when you sat me? Service and Food average. Can't say I would go back."
Well I take Bandeja Paisa. It was good but nothing magic. Waiter forget my order of empanadas but not big deal. For steakhouse it was correct but not good
"I really love the food and that is what kept us ordering. ��However, after what happened today, we will NEVER order from them again. ��To begin with, they are always so rude when they answer the phone! ��We placed an order and after 1 hour 15 minutes it hadn't arrived and we called them. ��They said their delivery driver got his car stolen with all the deliveries. ��Understandable, but did they call us to let us know? ��NO! ��So, they said they would make it for us and have it there is a few minutes. ��45 minutes later, we are still waiting and trying to call. ��NO ONE answered the phone for 20 minutes!! ��It just rang and rang. ��When the delivery driver got here after a total waiting time of 2 hours 15 minutes, I told him the situation and asked to see what he could do. ��He called and they offered "
"Everything is good here! I've been to wildfire many times now and have tried many different appetizers/entrees and now i'm always at a loss of what to order because I really love it all. Some of my favorites include the chopped salad, cocunut shrimp, steak, the halibut (which all my friends absolutely love), salmon, sweet potato side, and the sauteed mushrooms are awesome as well. It's impossible to leave room for dessert at wildfire, but they have amazing desserts if you can manage to leave just a bit of room. :)"
"I've been going to Lockdown since they opened, and I love it. ��It's a blend of four of my favorite things: ��awesome food, metal music, sports, and drinking. ��They are known for their burgers, but between my friends and me I think we've tried everything on the menu, and it's all fabulous. ��They have a great beer selection, and they always seeem to have both drink and food specials going on. ��The staff is super friendly, and since it's on Western it's easy to get to. ��It's definitely not a ""sports bar"" (it's cooler than that), ��but there are TVs everywhere, with at least half of them tuned to sports. ��Like I said, it's pretty much the best of everything. ��The downsides are the music can be a little loud (even if you like metal), and on certain nights (half-price burger Tuesdays, for example)"
"This place was amazing, a line out the door and it was pouring rain, don't be in a hurry if you order the pan pizza it takes a while but is so worth it in the end! Just enjoy a few green lines while you wait."
"Holy, this place is good. ��My girl and I first wandered in here last week and we've been twice since then. ��Thankfully my gym is open 24 hours a day because Hot Dougs aint exactly healthy. ��However, as soon as you bite into one of those dogs...man, its like heaven.Go on friday for duck fat fries."
"Best dining experience I have ever had. ��The service was excellent and most of all the food was outstanding. ��I have gone back so many times now that I have tried everything on the menu. ��Every dish is rich in flavor and excellent. ��I normally don't go out for Italian being that I am Italian and can cook at home. ��However, I can not duplicate the unique and taste full dishes created here. ��Two of my favorites for sure ��are the Veal Portafoglio and the Pesto Gnocchi. ��INCREDIBLE!!!"
"Spacca Napoli crafts the best pizza in the City of Chicago, hands down. My wife and I went there and enjoyed both a margherita and a marinara (no cheese) pizza. We each had a glass of the house red and finished with a complimentary glass of dessert wine - don't you love it when you get something on the house unexpectedly? These pizzas were heaven. Now, I love pizza, and have tried a lot of other famous Chicago establishments including Great Lake. This is undeniably the best. Not to mention the awesome original art produced by one of the owners that graces the walls!"
Wow. ��We just get the pan cheese pizza from here but it is fabulous. ��That caramelized onion crust makes a huge difference between an okay pizza and a fabulous one.
"Save your money, overpriced and not worth it. ��While salad bar had lots of items, they were low quality. ��Sushi was ridiculous - only CA rolls, lobster bisque was thin/watery, meat was too salty and dried out. ��Server was ok but they guys that bring the meat were over even when our card was red and then when we wanted more, nowhere to be found! ��Even the famed acrobat disappointed. ��She sat more than she flew. ��They didn't clear plates, used plate sat there entire time. ��Also tried to call to change the number of people in my party and to ask about parking and menu options. ��No answer, no call back, goes right to vm. ��What a bad experience!"
"After trying dozens of Chicago deep dish pizzas, Art of Pizza blows the competition away. ��The crust is very unique with a slight sweet aftertaste. ��Highly recommended!!"
"My family LOVES Chicago style deep dish pizza, but Lou's is still BY FAR our favorite. ��I'd rate the pizza at Giordano's a 3.5, but I cannot give this location more than 1 star due to the terribly rude and/or incompetent service we received by more than 1 employee (and I am normally a very tolerant person!). ��I guess since their location is so good and so many of their patrons are tourists, they feel they don't need to worry about providing a pleasant experience and good customer service or treating people with respect, as they probably get enough volume to be profitable!We were there in the afternoon between the lunch and dinner rush, so hardly any customers were there. We were hoping for a couple slices to go just to get a taste, but since they didn't sell slices, we ordered a small plai"
Awesome. Try the wednesday date night!
"Being in the area, I've been here several times. Most notably I've eaten here with my husband 3 days during the week of 11/22. Most of the platters are huge, they shower you with a daily special sample - chicken soup, meatball soup, stewed meat, just about anything. The service is quick and effecient. The bowl of chips is never ending. That week I had the tampicquena, pollo ranchero and carne asada, all delicious."
Place is pretty good. Great food for a great price. They give you free chips and salsa too so that's a plus. You should try the chimichanga but it is hot so be careful when you hold it. Great place to go with your pals and I would definitely go back there
"Unfortunately, Gino's East and Chicago deep dish pizza are dead. ��It was great up until the mid 1980's, then it began to go downhill. ��Maybe the retirement of the great pizza maker, a talented black woman, had something to do with it ... or maybe simply the expansion into a chain and the dilution of quality. ��Today, Gino's pizza is unrecognizable -- and inedible. ��And the tragedy is, it's never coming back. ��There aren't even many who remember what it once was. The same thing happened to Uno's. ��As these places turned from great local institutions into rip-off tourist traps, the magic was lost. ��As for those ignorant enough to rave about what's left of Gino's, they must be either ringers, or people who love Ragu sauce on dried up corn bread."
"This is some of the best sushi in the city and the prices are very reasonable. ��The sushi chefs may be the fastest in the country. ��I am always impressed at how fast, fresh and innovative the sushi is. ��The staff is very welcoming and attentive. ��They work as a team and it never feels tense there. ��It is very quiet too, no loud music, but a lively and relaxed atmosphere."
"We walked here from the zoo on a hot Friday for lunch. Our server, Sean, treated us very well even though we split a sandwich and our check was small during a crowded time . . . not to worry, we gave him a good tip. The restaurant had a pub feel to it and was quite busy with lots of families with small children. Noisy in a good way for me although my wife didn't agree. We both were happy with the food - the soup from the salad bar surprised us at its quality and the swiss cheese and mushroom turkey burger was delish, refills before you ask on sodas. They split the burger for us without complaint and gave us ample french fries along with pickles. The general manager was busing tables and was very pleasant when we chatted him up. Too be sure, this was not a high-end, white-tablecloth deal, b"
"Yay for my first Yelp review ever~! I had to just write a review for Simply It because it's simply amazing. I've been here at least ten times already ever since I discovered it last summer, and the food, service, and atmosphere has consistently been very good. Being away from home (VA), it makes me really miss Vietnamese food. Now, I know that Argyle is much closer to me, yet I still venture out to this place all the time despite the 7..8 minute walk from the El. Why? Not only is the food really good, but I was greeted with such warmness that it made me feel so homey. Cau Tuan, the owner is such a nice man. He treated me like I was part of his family and that's what I appreciate most. And his staff is very hospitable as well. ��The service is wonderful; very attentive and quick. I always ge"
"I've been going to this little gem now for about 4 years, and it's simply the BEST. After trying many italian places in Chicago, I keep coming back here for the WONDERFUL food, cute atmosphere, and excellent service. Some of my favorite parts:1. Warm, soft bread to start out with (not just a hard knob of bread like some places offer)2. Pumpkin Ravioli - too die for :-)3. Chicken Pesto Gnocchi - Also to die for :-)4. The Bread Pudding - holy cow, save room for this!5. Chef Anthony - so nice! he is always out and about chatting with people at some point during the night. He really cares about this place!Try it out! It can be really busy, but make a reservation, then it's no problem. When the weather is warm, sit outside at one of their patio tables, they are great!!"
"Extremely saddened by my last visit to this restaurant. And by last I mean, I was there yesterday for the last time...ever. And no I am not moving, I am boycotting and I suggest taking care when you go there and who you bring with you. This has been my favorite chinese restaurant since I moved to Chicago four years ago and I have never had a problem until I went yesterday with a friend who'd never been there. I have always been served quickly, friendly, over the top good when visiting in the past and I raved about the service and great food to my friend I brought with me this visit. The service we got was an outrage. At first I thought it was just because it was kind of busy (all of the tables were full but there was no one waiting to be seated). But as time passed not only did I notice so"
"I like you a lot, a real, real lot my little sausages. ��I would be a regular if it wasn't so outrageuosly business with only a limited window of opportunity to enter for lunch."
"Negatives:the oily smell of hair and clothing when you leave the place. ��Revolting.Also very crowded and small, narrow walkways. ��Also, how are you supposed to see your food? If you come here make sure to bring a flashlight powerful enough for a dark cave! Could not even read the bill when it came! Otherwise, the low lighting made it seem romantic yada yada. ��And also the wine bottles on the shelves and the atmosphere with the guitar-playing had its benefits. ��It's very crowded-must have reservations! We pushed our reservation back the same day we went, and the staff was very accomodating. ��(complementary coat check available is nice as well)The food was comendable but expensive. ��The cheese fondue was amazing, especially with apples and grapes. ��I had the seafood deluxe which consisted of"
"Disappointed with the food vs. price. Food was above average however I felt that the pricing was a bit too high. Would recommend, but the price is more than I'd like for the type of restaurant it is."
"I went here for dinner and was surprised that it was like a buffet. The lamb was a bit rare, but the red tail New Zeland Deer was awesome. I love that the harvest table has so many options for you to choose from.My one complaint was the wait, we were told that there would be a 45 minute wait, 1 and a half hours later we were seated, the restaurant had at least 6 open tables."
Went here are first time in Chicago. ��Service wasn't that good and for the money either was the food.
"My family and I had reservations for this place. ?When we got there, they showed us the worst hospitality I have ever seen. ?First, our table was set for 6 instead of 7. ?2nd, they did not want to move us to larger table. ?The owner told us straight up, Sorry, I cannot move or bring another table for you. ?I can recommend other places to eat if you'd like. ?Once he said that, we were out of there. ?Why should he get our business if he spoke to us like we were of no value to him."
"Spacca Napoli exceeded my expectations. ��I heard this place was great, but I've heard that about so many average pizza places around the city. ��I thought this pizza really lived up to its billing. ��They say this is authentic Neopolitan pizza and I can say that it is definitely a unique style for Chicago. ��I had the mushroom and sausage pizza which is very simple. ��A little bit of tomato sauce and mozzarella, some basil and plenty of mushrooms and sausage. ��The key to the pizza is that the ingredients are fresh and I have to say that I love the crust. ��The outer crust is flaky and cripy and the inner portion is gooey and cheesy. ��I could see how some people would have an issue with the middle portion of the crust, and with most pizzas I've consumed a soft, wet crust is a severe detriment, b"
Very awesome place to have breakfast. ��I love their sweet potatoos mixed with onions and other stuff. ��Check this place out if you live in the neighborhood.
"This is the BEST pizza in the city and the price point cannot be beat. The service is fast, the employees are friendly and there's always a great selection of pizzas if you just pop in to get a slice to go (they are always fresh and warm too). The thin crust and deep dish are both awesome!"
"Just don't ... unless, it your desire to pig out quickly. ��too much, too fast and too costly for what you get. ��I heard about this from a couple of friends and they raved about the quantity of meat - that should have been my first clue. ��The wait staff is extremely attentive to bringing more and more - they go the extra mile to do a good job. ��And the meat is fine; its just that a dining experience should be more than getting too much to eat as quick as possible. ��It just felt wrong."
"Very nice breakfast place. ��The service is great and food was delicious. ��We got seated pretty quick, considering how full the place was and were promptly taken care of. ��portions are HUGE so bring your appetite! ��I don't venture out to the city that early to often, but will definitely consider it."
"Two stars for the style of this place. ��They lost three stars with us tonight because the service was absolute garbage. ��The door man was dismissive and the bartenders are inattentive and unfriendly. ��No one working there seemed happy to have customers. ��It's too bad because with better service, this place could be a gem."
"Overpriced, lacking in imagination."
My husband and I visited the bad apple this past Sunday. Half the place was filled at 2:00 in the afternoon. We ordered a round of bloodymarys. Mandy makes a delicious drink. I ordered the el dorado and my husband ordered the bad apple burger. They were both cooked to order and they were great. The salsa really made my burger tasty. The fries were wonderful as well. I would recommend the bad apple to anyone and we look forward to our next dinner there
"A great place to go with the person you love, ��Great service and prices."
"Whenever I am in Chicago, hungry, and have time, I look for restaurants bustling with people. It is my theory that the good restaurants are the crowded restaurants. XOCO held true to my theory.*While standing in line for 40 minutes, I was able to have a long look at the menu. I commend XOCO for this; the menu was a ten-foot wide billboard that could be seen from fifty feet away. When I finally arrived at the register, I ordered the Choriqueso for $9. ?The Choriqueso is a type of Torta consisting of homemade chorizo sausage, roasted poblano, artisan jack cheese, and tomatillo salsa. If you are like me, and like sausage, then this will be the best Torta you will ever eat. It is that simple. The cool and acidic tomatillo salsa contrasts the warm and smooth artisan jack cheese perfectly- both "
We love the food and service at Sushi X. Great BYOB place! We try to eat there at least once a month.
"I wish that they offered their lunch menu on days that I didn't have to work, so that I wouldn't sometimes have to call in sick to eat lunch here."
"My aunt took myself and my cousin for our birthday. Although I am not a red meat eater, my experience was great. Our waiter place our desert on a plate and placed HAPPY BIRTHDAY on the plate in sauce. I had a wonderful time from the valet to the end of the meal."
"The sweet potato fries are extremely addictive, and this place totally satisfies my burger craving with their veggie version - the Creole mustard you get with the burger is so good, I ask for a small container to take home! A great little place for vegetarians looking for some satisfying, yummy food in a friendly atmosphere..."
This place is just.......GREAT! ��Their mojitos are the best in the City and their porkchop is mouth watering. ��You can always count on great service from the waitstaff time after time.Overall they really get my 5 Star vote as they are so consistent and you just can't find a more fun atmosphere.
"I'd been to Anteprima a couple years ago on a Friday evening for a group dinner and wasn't very satisfied with the experience. I felt like it was very loud and the meals were overpriced. I'm writing this review because I had a different experience a few weeks ago.I went with just one other person a few weeks ago and we had a great experience. The restaurant seemed much quieter and felt more intimate. The food was excellent and the prices weren't outrageous. This may all have been the difference between initially going on a Friday evening to recently going on a Sunday evening. This time, I also shared all appetizers, main courses, and wine with the other person. That may have also helped in making the prices feel more reasonable.Overall, I feel this is a nice place to go to if you're lookin"
"My friend and I came here for lunch, and the people were wonderful and the environment was nice. We ordered poutine and half way done we find a finger nail, no lies. We tell them and the guy just said Oh, let me take that for you. So we're like alright whatever he might not charge us. We get our main course (Burger and a Chicken Sandwich) and my friend finds hair with the fries. My friend had no more appetite and didn't even touch his burger yet. He tells the waiter and guess what he said? Are you done with that sir? My friend was explaining to him and that waiter just took it and walked away. We asked for our bill and they charged us everything, they didn't give us new food, didn't apologize, and this was the service we got from a restaurant like this. You would think you they would do at"
"It was one of the first warm Friday nights of spring and and a bunch of work folks were looking to grab a few drinks after a hard week. The only prerequisite was a nice outdoor seating area. Zed451 Check!. However from the minute we walked in until the we finally left a few hours later the service was poor to nonexistent, the ambiance pretentious, and response from management was cavalier. The group of 7 or 8 arrived about 530 and asked to be seated upstairs for drinks. They took our name and put it on a list. I thought, WOW they must really be busy already so we grabbed some seats in the normal bar area only to be ignored for 20 minutes until a waitress finally decided to assist us. Soon after, our buzzer went off and we were headed upstairs. I'm thinking ""great"" that was rather quick con"
"This is one of my favorite restaurants. Whenever my girlfriend and I are looking for a place to celebrate something, we end up here. I've never had a bad meal here and the drinks are fabulous, too!"
"I was a big fan of Wishbone several years ago, but something just doesn't seem quite the same these days. ��My main complaint is that I ordered the shrimp Po' boy and was gravely disappointed. ��Maybe I'm spoiled by all the foodie TV shows that show Po' Boys as these sandwiches w/ hearty rolls of bread piled high with fillings, whether shrimp, fish or what have you. ��I got the hearty roll, - 7"" long, nearly 2"" thick. ��But the six or seven shrimp the size of my pinkie finger were almost a joke. I literally took all the shrimp and piled them on one side of the bread and folded THAT bread over and still had extra room for more. ��You get the picture. �� Good thing I ordered the cajun fries, to give me some sense of Louisiana favor and filling that I was anticipating. ��Just letting you know. :-/"
YUMMY FreASH AND GREAT
"HiWent to the most amazing restaurant in Chicago, Alinea. Check out their website.If you look at the menu we had the tour. Outrageous! Check out the gallery, look at the food. One example: a covered soup tureen. In it a spoon balanced across the bowl. In the spoon as small serving of seafood. Under it- two slices of japanese cedar burning and smoking the food. another example: parmesan cheese run through a seltzer bottle to create a foam, then frozen. Melts in your mouth and tastes like the most intense parmesan you've ever had. They make their own utensils most of which is quite unusual. The experience is best described as abstract art as food."
"We just ��LOVE ��this place. ��They decor is uniquely Turkish. The staff are really NICE. ��The service is ��GREAT. ��They use really fresh ingredients. ��I had the Chicago crepe. ��it's simply Delicious! ��You must try ��it. �� My friend had the strawberry crepe. ��The presentation was lovely & couldn't have been more Delicious. ��I hope more people try this little neighborhood TREASURE. ��The prices are Reasonable. ��There are many Vegetarian choices, as all crepes are meatless. They give you the option of ADDING your choice of ��MEAT ��for an additional small charge. �� Also you can create your own crepe. Use your imagination. ��And the soup is a ��vegetable strained ��soup & is just out of this world!!! ��Reasonable prices. Most crepes are $8.50 meatless. ��Add meat for $2.50."
"I have mixed feelings about this place - because our experience was somewhat lacking, yet it really does have a lot going for it. It definitely has 'ambience.' It's charming and intimate, if not just a bit on the cramped side. Parking is good if you park on the side street nearby. They offer a decent selection of pastas, although we were a bit confused with our waiter's explanation of the homemade vs. out of the box choices (and the difference in cost, at least according to him). In fact, our server was the worst part of our dining experience. He was impatient, distracted, and at times, downright rude. At one point, he actually walked away as my husband was still speaking to him. We literally had to ask someone to send him back to our table, which clearly annoyed him. When I asked ��questio"
"One meal here rocked my world! ��My brother and sis-in-law took me here last weekend and it was damn hard to choose. ��Finally I had the carnitas caldo [soup]: rich, peppery, garlicky, clear broth with a generous portion of roasted pork carnitas, corn-potato dumplings, a couple slices of roasted zucchini, garnished with fresh avocado, fresh mild arugula, and fresh lime. ��Amazing! ��If you eat pork, ORDER THIS. ��It changed my life. ��The fresh lime juice completed the perfect combination of flavors and textures. ��The cooked corn chips right out of the cooker had a perfume like no other: earthy, probably just-ground corn (some heirloom variety, I bet). ��I inhaled the aroma over the dish and probably got high. �� Amazing! ��The guac was good, and the red and green chile sauces were interesting & co"
"As a relative newcomer to Chicago, I was excited to try out Frontera. Certainly, the line (which formed at 5pm on a Thursday night) was impressive. Unfortunately, that was the only impressive thing of the evening. The food was mediocre at best. Both the pork and chicken were dry and the inelegant, heavy dousing of mole sauce didn't make up for it. Too many tables meant I got more than one opportunity to enjoy someone else's derriere in my face as I attempted to eat dinner. And the service was barely adequate -- comparable to what you'd get at your average IHOP. Sorry, Mr. Bayless. I guess you're making a mint on the TV Show, the cookbooks and the supermarket sauces. And it's a good thing because eventually someone will figure out how entirely overrated your restaurants are."
my favorite pho in the city. the menu is so huge that its a bit overwhelming and the place is so packed that you sometimes get sat at tables with other people. these are the only two faults but you really cant help that your food is so good and your menu is so big that you are packed pretty much all day. just found out they now deliver. thumbs up
"I've never had dinner there, but it's by far my favorite lunch place in the neighborhood. ��I'm a HUGE steak guy so I know that when I go to a steakhouse and order the chicken, it's no joke. ��Do yourself a favor and swing by Kinzie for lunch. ��Grab the blackened chicken sandwich on their pretzel roll and I guarantee you'll go back. ��What they say is true. ��Once you go blackened, you never go back!"
"Two stars is generous because I've actually had worse pizza than this.Anyone that thinks this is what Chicago pizza is a about just movedhere and lives in Lakeview or Lincoln Park. ��As a Chicago native, I love my pizza. ��My wife is from Indy and she called this pizza ""barely edible.""That said, the salad was worse than the pizza. ��I was starving, and I still am. ��Probably going to throw the leftovers out. ��Boo."
"Good food, HORRIBLE service. The rude hostess made me and my guests feel very unwelcome. Totally flattened the mood for my 21st birthday, thanks!"
"This is my favorite Italian restaurant on the north side of Chicago after eating here 5 or 6 times.I'll start off with why it only gets 4 stars from me and not 5. ��This place is EXTREMELY and RIDICULOUSLY loud. ��It is a big restaurant and they are trying to seat way too many people in the main section, when they have a lot of room outside. ��I feel like a SARDINE in that section, and basically some stranger next to me can hear everything I say, because they are literally a foot from me.On the positive front, every main dish I have ordered here has been good except for one. ��They have an excellent pasta dish with eggplant in it that I absolutely love. ��The servers are generally pretty good.Please turn down the music and the volume Mr./Ms. Owner."
"The bake goat cheese and the Norwegian Crest are amazing. I highly recommend these two dishes. My brother and his girlfriend loved it.If you're a college student like me, the pastries are just in range for your budget. I highly suggest the mango mousse cake andFeeling like a late night snack run? Artopolis does not close until late. The service is great and the waiters have enthusiastic personalities. The style of this place looking very European and refreshing."
"I love this place. ��I'm trying to eat a vegan diet and this place has all the best food. ��A Taco Salad sounds like it would be easy to make, but this diner makes it the best! ��The deserts are pretty good and the vegan shakes are rich and yummy. ��I highly recommend this place for great vegan food. ��The vegan cheese they use is one of the best vegan options I've ever found!"
"I won't bother going into detail about the delicious meats; there are already 200+ reviews on that. ��All I want to suggest is that if you go to Brazzaz, make a reservation and be prepared to wait. ��We went last Sunday night for dinner, got there at 6:20 (with no reservations), and were told we had about a 20-minute wait. ��Not bad at all, I thought. ��After waiting an hour, we asked them what the deal was, and why 8 couples that got there after us had been seated already. ��We were told they were doing the best they could to fit the walk-ins in with the parties that had reservations; the couples that had gone ahead of us all had reservations, yet they still had to wait. ��Since we were on top of the walk-ins list, we decided to stick it out.We were finally seated after an hour and a half wait,"
"Service was awful, the wait was awful, and I've had better Chicago-style pizza in Saint Louis.Yes, deep dish pizza takes a long time to cook but we were probably at our table for less than 30 minutes of the TWO HOURS we spent at Giordano's - i.e., we weren't enjoying a leisurely meal and a bottle of wine, we were standing around hungry for an hour and a half. ��The wait staff is too busy moving customers in and out to really ""take care"" of you; perhaps they're just too European for me.And yeah, I said it - I've had better deep dish in Saint Louis. ��Blackthorn Pub on Wyoming Street has great deep dish that is MUCH better than Giordano's bland, overhyped stuffed pizza. ��Not worth the wait."
"From the the first step in doors, until the last scrumptious bite of gooey mozzarella melts in your mouth, this experience is one to fulfill all of your senses, especially those found on your pallet.Just being in this Establishment makes you feel like you might be a little bit Italian, even if you have no idea what ciao means. The staff is polite and professional. The service is right on. The food is................well, the food is the best part. When I visited Giordano's, I had a purpose. Friends had roared about their Chicago style deep dish pizza. Of course, I had to try it for myself. I had never had deep dish pizza before, so this was a brand new experience. What?! Sauce goes on top of the pizza?Let me tell you, it may take an extra 10 to 15 minutes for the deep dish to arrive, but i"
Best Greek food i've tried!!! ��Very attentive servers and Free Valet parking!!!!
"I've eaten there now 3 times, most recently last night. ��As always, the food there is exceptional and the wait staff is attentive, skilled and very friendly. ��I really only have 2 issues with this place. �� First of all the noise level. ��I had been there on weeknights before and it was OK, but last night (Saturday) was an anniversary dinner and the place was so loud we had to shout at each other to be heard - not ��very romantic...The other real improvement needed is some work on the wine list. ��The wines are all Italian...which I get being an Italian restaurant...but they're also very poor value for the money. ��I had a $34 bottle of white wine that wouldn't stand up to a $9 bottle of California, Chilean, or Australian wine. So, my recommendation is to go and eat there, but go mid-week, when"
"Horrible. Seated an hour late, tonic was as flat as the service. Food was barely mediocre, wine list was incomplete and the server was unapologetic for every clear mistake. Poor representative for a fantastic neighborhood."
"I am in love with this restaurant! ��We had great service, and the food was outstanding! ��Not your typical tapas place... MUCH Better!! ��For $55 they will do a 3 course chef selection of tapas. ��I highly recommend going this route. ��It allowed us to try a lot of food that I would have never ordered on my own. �� For $20 more, they will pair each course with wine :)"
A bit over-hyped. ��Too many sweet courses on the tasting menu. ��But overall an interesting and enjoyable experience for the senses.
"Absolutely, the top restaurant in the neighborhood! ��I was greeted very friendly, replaced napkins, filled the glasses all the time, impeccable service. Hot potatoes, strong flavors, tender meat, ��juicy and savory, dessert was so amazing and the wine too! This restaurant is a must try."
I really like this place. Its very cozy...Great food. Good service and nice friendly faces. I'd definitely recommend this place to my friends.
Great food although not outstanding. Tastes like any other Chinese place. The portions might seem smaller but they WILL fill you up. Pros:Starts off with Chinese restaurant tea (love love love!)Interesting menuChinatown mall location!Great orange chicken CleanQuietCons:The waiters -.- I told the guy 5 times I was a student and he never marked off the student discount on my bill. The have a sign for student discounts! If you say so then please do so. I will definitely come back one day to try their other dishes!
"Good food and friendly service. ��I went with the pulled pork sandwich with corn bread and a side of beans. ��Since they are still BYOB (getting their license this week apparently) I decided to do take out. ��Found out they forgot the corn bread, but I called and they said they would comp. my next meal, which is fantastic customer service.There are a lot of good things on the menu, so I hope to try them all. ��Definitely a swanky looking place too - I walk by it every morning to get coffee and never ever would have though it was BBQ.My only know is that they need a bit of a bigger bar area with more seating at the actually bar. ��And the bar itself has a funky design where it's divided in to three sections, so that's a bit odd. ��But anyway, good place overall."
Other than waiting in line thease guys have the best dogs in the world I went to the new store in Wheeling and it looks nice but it's just not the same.... Kinda like the old Hawks stadium vs the new one
"If you make a reservation here, be aware of long wait times possibly. ��I had a 7:30 reservation and I was not seated until 8:45! That is not acceptable for one of the better Italian restaurants in Chicago. ��I was extremely irritated and enraged because of the long wait time. ��When we finally were seated, the waiter and manager took care of us personally by offering us a complimentary a bottle of wine and an antipasti plate (both were very good). ��The food, ambiance, and decor were excellent and our server was excellent! I would recommend going there, but make sure to call ahead to find out if they are running on time with your reservation!"
"Just had a fantastic late lunch here. It was just me so I ordered the salami, goat cheese and olive tapenade panini, a side of prosciutto, and for dessert, the nutella, banana and marshmallow dessert panini.The savory panini was amazing and I can't recommend it enough. Note that it consists of 2 sandwiches - so this was slightly more food than I was expecting, although they weren't huge so it wasn't a problem. The prosciutto was okay - I like mine with more flavor but it was still very good. The dessert was excellent and definitely worth trying, but it is literally the same as the other paninis, but with powdered sugar on top. So for me, there was too much bread and not enough of something else on the inside - I think it needed more nutella and probably needed to slice the bananas a little"
"My family stumbled into this place on a recent hot day downtown and needless to say we will be returning. ��The meat, the soup, the sushi, the fresh sides and salad bar...did I mention the meat?Amazing!"
"I never yelp, however this place was amazing! My friends and I showed up at 8:30 on a Thursday night and were told it would be an hour and a half wait. Normally, we would be scared off by such a wait but there is a bar and a large enough waiting area that it seemed fine. We were originally a party of 8 however became a party of 13 as the time went on. The wonderful host was so accommodating, as a hostess myself I would say that he deserves five stars alone! The staff was friendly and prompt and the food was out of this world! Because we had vegetarians at our table we ordered the basil, goat cheese, and garlic pizza...one word...DELICIOUS. It definitely hit the spot. The beer they brew there is delicious, try the moose knuckle brew on tap. Over all Piece was friendly staff, great atmospher"
"1st time 2nd time and 3rd time were all the charm!! Great Meat and the service was really good!. The manager said it best, are you enjoying yourselves? if so i should go fast to not ruin it lol"
"Where to start with this place? Went there this last weekend with a date because I had heard about how good the food was and have always been curious about Romanian food. Well suffice it to say the menu is European at best. And the owner Branko is far from Romanian. In fact I over heard him talking poorly about Romanian people to what was clearly a very young and very new busgirl /host??? ?Our waiter was a very nice and courteous american gentlemen that actually helped us with the menu and gave a great recommendation about the Beef Goulash and Veal Paprika dish. He also sold me on the Romanian Pinot Noir wine. Yet even though he seemed to be busy basically covering the entire floor being a waiter, busboy, host and bartender while this Branko went around hitting on every female in the build"
"Food was not good at all. ��Crust soggy and had the flavor of cardboard. ��Bartender was inattentive...the bar wasn't busy at all...then he just left and there was no one tending the bar. ��Very bizarre. ��The host said there were no tables available...come on, there were tables and it was later in the evening. �� No lines. �� I think it was because my date was BLACK....if you're AFRICAN AMERICAN, they won't seat you. ��We had to seat ourselves...the waiter was okay, though. ��THIS IS A RACIST ESTABLISHMENT. ��Take your business elsewhere."
"i love middle eastern food the this place hits an all time low blow ,food horrible, and dry like the desert............."
"I had the chicken tacos on one ocassion, and the fish tacos on another. ��Both times, I got them to-go.Dude, the place was as smokey as all get-out -- my brother had to exit the place cause he couldn't stand it. ��It smelled really badly of grease. ��Just today I was walking by the place, and it smells up that whole area like grease.The chicken tacos were underwhelming. ��Why charge extra for guac, cheese, etc.? ��Why not just make a good taco, and then charge whatever is appropriate? ��Both the chicken and the fish were dry-tasting (even with salsa) and needed sour cream or cheese or something. ��My brother said the same thing about his ground beef tacos. ��If I'm forced to go again, I'll definitely pay extra for the cheese, but can't they just make that the default...."
Great steaks! ��And Monday night half-price wine bottles is an incentive to go out on a Monday when it's less crowded. Always attentive service without hovering. ��A favorite.
"I don't understand why this place packs 'em in, especially on the weekends. ��Food is at best average with an unimaginative menu, and employees seem to treat most customers like they are a nuisance. ��What I do like is the outdoor cafe on Division St... it's very pet friendly and has big umbrellas to block the sun. ��For a better breakfast or brunch, I suggest jam around the corner on Damen."
Excellent overall. ��Nice atmosphere. ��And the food was excellent in my opinion. ��Had the stuffed cabbage which was nothing short of fabulous. The prices were quite reasonable
I eat here for lunch as much as possible 3-4 times a week i love the steak sandwich and the empanadas are great!!!!
"When I visit Chicago, this is my favorite Sunday brunch spot. ��My friend loves the Eggs Benedict so much she will order nothing other than that. ��I've tried several things on the Brunch menu, but the Crab and Asparagus Omelette is a ""must-try"", yum! ��We also love the champagne cocktails, very flavorful and different. ��My steady order on the drink menu is the Blood Orange Mimosa, to die for... my Eggs-Benedict-loving friend won't miss the Pomegranate Champagne Cocktail. But I don't think you could go wrong with any of their recipes. ��Try it, you'll like it!!! �� :-)"
"We live close by and it seems that la villa is always there when we need it. Casual dinner, quick take out or a family get together. Shrimp ale capri is our favorite."
"So my wife and I have eaten 3 times now and we both agree that there are some hits but quite a few misses. The past two times we went for brunch and my wife had the crab cakes Benedict and I had the French toast with caramelized pecans, peach compote and maple syrup. The flavors were spot on but the chef seems to have a problem with textures. The crab cakes were wet and the poached egg was runny. Combine that with hollandaise sauce the whole thing had such a bad texture, like saucy mush, but the flavors were great and the large lumps of crab were very nice.My French toast had a texture issue. They use a homemade bread that either was stale or not soaked in the egg mixture. I love fluffy French toast that has a pan fired exterior and a soft, fluffy interior. The bread they used crumbled in "
great sushi and fantastic bar area - Retro china vibe. ��Enjoy hanging out with friends in there. ��Restaurant can get kind of chaotic and cramped with seating - but really a fun and good place to eat!
Food is excellent & great service!!!The setting is very pleasant :)
"I love this place, love the food, love the service. I wuold recommend this place to anyone. I went to a similar one in florida and it did not even measure up to fogo de choa in chicago!"
"Totally awesome for dinner, and nice to have something in the neighborhood. My only complaint is that, aside from the Tom Waits for No Man, (vanilla infused whiskey, chai, etc...), the featured martinis tend to be more ""interesting"" than actually appetizing. ��I suggest sticking with your favorite (and no doubt less expensive) beer or mixed-drink of choice. ��Sweet potato fries are amazing, and I don't really even like sweet potatoes!"
"the food here is awful. ��i would never go back, even if living social offered be another voucher for 5 bucks for 30 dollars worth of food. ��30 dollars only feeds one person at this pricey restaurant.the stuffed chicken was bland, no flavor, needed salt, the lasanga was more romanian than italian, the best thing was the chocolate ganache cake with red raspberry sauce. ��the service was fair and freindly. in the end you don't save any money on these restaurant deals unless you go by yourself. i don't think you should have to tip (18%) on the total meal before voucher because that is why you buy the deal in the first place. too save a little money."
"Best Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. ��The hotpot is not to be missed, as well as the Szechuan green beans and the amazing Tony's chicken. I have no problem finding things for my 3 year old daughter to eat, either. ��She adores their dumplings (jiaozi) and the staff always lavishes attention on her. ��I love the vibe of Chinatown and Lao Sze Chuan is the crown jewel of all the restaurants in the area."
"Love Love Loved it- & I don't even like hot dogs! My brother convinced me that this wasn't just a hot dog joint & he was right-they had so many different varieties of encased meats that I forgot that we were choosing 'hot dogs'. I got a chicken & spinach dog-it oozed some sort of cheese-delish! my kids loved it too- & they had to wait for an hour to get in so that's saying a lot :) don't know that I am the best reviewer for the duck fat fries- they were good, but not sure I have a sop"
"So I came here thinking this place would be amazing.............and it was so so. I ordered the kabobs............and I was kinda disappointed it didn't actually come on kabobs. I mean it was pretty good (I think they have better Persian food in Andersonville, but maybe that's just me) The waitress was nice and knowledgeable but besides that, it wasn't an amazing dining experience. Food was decent but that's about it. The worst part was about 5 minutes after getting dessert, we got our bill and were more or less asked to leave once we finished dessert since they needed the table. I wasn't even halfway done with my coffee before we were ushered out of the store. So yeah, not the best place to eat in Albany Park, if you're in the mood for Middle Eastern fare, there are tons of other choices "
"This is the best!! Been going for over 25 years!! Never been let down, always lot's of great food, lunch specials or dinner, wonderful service tooooooooooo!!"
Very good Italian restaurant that we have been visiting for a number of years. It's a great restaurant for a date...perfectly cozy and very friendly service. We sometimes even have our wonderful entrees complimented by a serenade. I certainly recommend this establishment for a romantic and calm evening.
"I had been to FDC before. I was excited to bring a few friends, and had been chatting up the place for a few weeks. We got in quickly with reservations. The waiter was not interested in us at all, he never made eye contact with us. ��The salad bar is really great. Do try the basil dressing, its amazing. ��The meat was very good. I suggest the lamb...I never liked it before, but the chops were great!!! ��I was impressed, I came back fron the salad bar and went to sit down and a random waiter pushed my chair in for me...never saw him again. Over all the group I brought enjoyed their meal, we had a nice time, the drinks were great...would I go back again? Maybe. Our server was more concerend with pushing drinks than how our dinner was. Kudos to the guys who actually work...the gouchos with the m"
"Grand Lux has a great menu that continues to impress me. I've been visiting for over four years and have yet to try something I don't like. From appetizers to desserts, you're sure to enjoy the food. The ambiance is classy, but feel free to walk in after a day of shopping in jeans and a tee and enjoy the view from windows overlooking Chicago."
"my all time favorite mexican restaurant in chicago. ��my favorite dishes are tacos sabinas, carne asada, and enchiladas suizas. ��everything tastes home made and it's cheap too. ��they have the best refried beans i've ever had. ��BYOB too. ��they also have awesome breakfast."
"Chicken, walking around and acting like butter...How ambitious, how boastful! -- how oh-so-right......."
"never been to any other steakhouse before, so not really sure what to expect!i will keep this review simple!For all of you reading reviews here in yelp prior going to Brazzaz to eat for the first time, here is a tip: skip the salad bar! Also, make sure to request the lamb chops! Lamb Chops and Shrimps! Lamb Chops and Shrimps!need to make another reservation... before all the Lamb Chops and Shrimps are gone!!!!"
"Great place to grab a drink and eat. ��They have good specials too. ��My roommates and I just moved a block away and we bring guests to this place too. ��They also have good vegetarian selections if you are vegetarian. ��The staff is very nice and friendly. ��I gave it 4 stars only because it tries to act hard with it's heavy metal music and hardcore decor. ��The patrons and the staff are all very friendly, so I like it either way."
Delicious food! ��Great atmosphere! ��Great drinks! ��Good staff! ��Prices are high but it's Chicago so that is to be expected. ��My friend and I split the steak and it was plenty of food. ��I recommend getting the ropa vieja first. ��Mmmmm.... ��So much fun and can't wait to go back!!!
"Next time you're in Chicago, head down to Ruth's Chris to get one of the best steaks you'll ever taste. Don't worry about how much you spend there...you only live once and steaks this good are few and far between. See what life is like served on a platter of sizzling butter!FOOD:Our group got some a la carte items that were great: ��fresh asparagus with hollandaise, Tempura onion rings with honey Thai sauce, calamari, and the Veal Osso Buco ravioli. Everything was cooked and prepared very well and I didn't have any complaints about the taste whatsoever. For my main dish, I got the Ribeye and it was excellent! Cooked exactly to order and was rich with flavor. Being served on a bed of sizzling butter really does add some great flavor!SERVICE:Our waiter was very attentive and kind. He was alwa"
"I am sure the fact that Tank Noodle is only a few steps away from my condo helps the rating......but besides that it is just THE place for delicious Pho and all sorts of other fantastic vietnamese food! I think I have tried almost every dish they offer in the last few years, and I have to say I was never disappointed. Everything is made with extremely fresh ingredients, the service is fast and nice, and it is one of the cleanest places I know.I also recommend take-out...for some reason I think the servings are even bigger then.5*****"
"I do not understand why this place is so popular. ��Their food is not very original, or exciting...or authentic. ��It's not even very well prepared. ��The steak lollipops are more fat on a stick than anything else! ��Don't get me wrong, I'm the kind of girl who wants fat on her meat, but a line has to be drawn somewhere. ��While the design of the place is somewhat interesting, it's ridiculously uncomfortable. ��When I go out to eat I'd like to think about the food, not a hard piece of wood pressing into my sit-bones. ��The lounge couches are even worse. ��The back of the couch is way too far away from the front of the couch, so if you'd like to lean back you can either do so at a 160 degree angle, or you have to scoot all the way to the back so that your legs are sticking straight out over the edg"
"Was there w/ friends, but this would be a great date place too.Great service & food too.If u are a vegetarian, it wouldn't be the place for u. For us meat lovers, yummmmm :)"
"The atmosphere in the restaurant is vey pleasant, services was amazing great and the food delicious, I'll recommend to all my friends. My favorite dish is the Paella"
"Ate at GE for the first (and last) time last night. ��I am a very experienced diner at all levels, including other molecular gastronomy experiences. This experience missed the mark at many levels. I know what they were trying to do, but they didn't get it done.The drinks, amuse and dessert were fine. ��The apps and entrees were average at best. The wait staff was sure that they were cool and therefore were too busy to do their jobs well.Poor pacing, poor explanations of dishes (largely due to the noise level), failure to refill water glasses, and 1 diner that went without a napkin for most of the meal (After the waiter took it from them when it hit the ground).This would have been a good meal for 140 dollars. For 240 dollars it was below average at best.Very disappointed!"
"Honestly, this place is so consistantly good it's almost unbelievable. Truly the best sushi (and an incredible value for the quality) that I've ever had!"
Ehhh... I thought the truffled popcorn was the highlight of all the food and that was free. ��It's really noisy in there and it definitely more of a trendy socializing scenery place rather than a romantic or catch-up with friends dinner - kind of place. ��The food was expensive as expected from this type of place but I wish it tasted better. ��Maybe me and my two friends all just ordered the wrong thing.
NOT GOOD and terrible service!!! They don't honor reservations so make sure to be ready to wait!!! Food was average at best.
"Irazu is delicious and affordable! ��Go there! ��I recommend the steak or chicken sandwich, the chicken casado, the oatmeal shake (dairy or soy), and their vegan options are tasty, too! ��LOVE THIS PLACE!"
"I was taken out to eat by my parents, which is always nice when you are a college student. ��It actually holds some history within our family because it is where my parents had their first date. ��The menu's had entertaining little stories behind each of the items on the menu, and often times contained funny sarcasm. ��The food was Delicious and the salad bar was fantastic. ��A very good time 4 stars."
"I went to dinner at Wildfire last night with my friends (they recommended this place as a great steakhouse). I loved decor, food, service... Prices are high - that's the only reason I'm giving 4*! We started with their bread - its great, just don't eat too much! Soup of the day, then file minion ��- trio, we get to choose flavors and creamed spinach, boys had halibut with roasted vegetables... pie for dessert. Everything was delicious! Will go there again probably..."
"If you want your tongue to catch fire, this is the place to go to. Just make sure that you let them know that you're not afraid of spices and they'll quickly accommodate you. Large portions for cheap prices. I will definitely be back. The Tom Yum is great!"
We went in on a Saturday for lunch. We had a couple of falafel sandwiches. Food was good but nothing over the top. We might stop by again if in the area.
"This was my first visit to the Purple Pig after hearing all the rave reviews. I must say, every one of them is right!My boyfriend and I came in for a late lunchtime snack before dinner later in the evening and just expected a pleasant bite to tide us over. The place was very busy. We were greeted by a very sweet hostess who made time to greet us the second we walked in the door (despite the barrage of job applicants!) She politely excused herself from them and headed straight over to greet us. ?We requested outside seating and were promptly sat at the first large table.We were stunned by the lovely foliage that surrounded us, although the bees were the downside of that factor. Almost immediately after being seated our server came over to say that she'd be right with us. She carried several"
"Crisp is about as good as you could get for the price. They have great wings and fried chicken as well as the best chicken sandwich in the city. Their seoul sassy sauce is killer. If you are in the area and are trying to figure out what to eat, walk over to Broadway immediately."
"We live right across the highway from Greektown, ��but my husband doesn't like traditional Greek food, so Artopolis is a nice compromise - he gets the pineapple pizza (if you can believe that!), while I'll try something different every time. ��I like the pastry things (can't remember what they're called) - I love the ham and cheese one. ��We always save room for dessert - I love the fruit tarts.The only disappointment with the place is that there aren't free refills - the diet coke is a 10oz bottle, which is cute, but not nearly enough, and I hate spending $6 for diet cokes with dinner."
"I love this place. The food here is always good-- very consistant.....The delivery is great, the ��food shows up hot and fresh. I would reccomend the Koubidah and the Barg Kabob, my favorite. The Babagunoosh and the rice are by far the best. 5 stars would have been given if the menu prices were a bit lower, But i guess if you want great food you have tyo pay for it."
"My date and I went there on Saturday night at 7ish, ��We didn't have to wait even though the place was busy (plus). ��Our waitress , Gabby, knew her spiel to a tee (always freaks me out when they recommend dishes before they say Hello, but whatever). ��We had a plantain and beef appetizer, that we didn't order, but OOPS, Gabby misheard our entire order. ��We were scared to say the least. ��Gabby was so polite and actually had the right order out in a matter of moment (props to the kitchen) ��It was all amazing. ��We had the ribeye, ceviche de pescado, fried plantains, and the mystery plantain. ��Everything was ��delcious and Gabby was a great server. ��Ican't wait to sucker him into taking me back! ��The only negative was the oddly sloped floor..."
"I love this place! They have an adventurous food menu and a mile long beer list! HEAVEN! The only draw back is the wait. Not sure if they take reservations but this isn't a bar you can just call your girlfriends to meet you at for dinner. You would have to plan in advance to go there and wait for at least 45 minutes. I had the sausage plate and frites. My friends got the mussels and some kind of sandwhich they were raving about. The server suggesting food/drink pairing which was great for us. The service was great, the atmosphere was great and the wait was worth it. But I may not stop in as often as I'd like if I'm crunched for time or hungry!"
Wow. I went here back in March of '07 and I was very impressed with this place. The main dining area was expansive and the decor was decedent and beautiful. The foods were rich in taste and the selection on the menu was mouth watering. The service was also very good. My girlfriend and I especially liked the raspberry mojitos. Can't wait to come back here.
"Great coffee.Great chai.The BEST spinach quiche ever.Day old fresh marbled rye and pumperknickle bread for $1 can't be beat, if you can get it before it's gone."
"I dig this place. The pizza is always good, but sometimes it can be great. Great atmosphere. You can't beat the large pizza and jug of beer special."
"Awesome and great experience every single time! ��Perfect to enjoy the sound of great musicians and just feel at ease at this bar. ��The crowd can be enjoyable, even the lack of cigarette use has not devastated the bar."
"First time here, my boyfriend and I were drawn by the fish on the Spring prix fixe menu. ��The food was pretty good. The service was very good, although almost too attentive, and we decided we would go back at some point. ��The food was above average but I will reserve further judgement for future visits."
You get a big serving of food for the price you pay. Impeccable service. The music is great. It will bring back a lot of memories. I wish I would have thought of it first. My friends and I will definitely return. I hope they open up another one in the city.
"While the pizza may be good, the owners are not. ��Living nearby and having patronized this establishment for many years, they are definitely not good neighbors. ��We deal with the noise in the parking lot, overflowing garbage, which in turn breeds a rat infestation in the area and the total rudeness, I wouldn't recommend this place to a dog. ��There is a constant battle with the employees about parking, littering and loud behavior, both during the restaurant's operating hours and afterward. ��The employees have been witnessed urinating on front lawns or in bottles and tossing them on the front lawns, leaving beverage cans & bottles, including beer containers across front lawns and in the gutter of the street. ��Wish I could say something nice, but the abuse and harassment from the ownership ju"
"To the reviewer who mentioned not getting it and my review re: crappy service...1. ?I get it. ?I'm Greek.2. ?I disagree that getting liquored up cures crappy service.Don't assume that because you disagree with someone's review, you know a restaurant and its food better that he does. ?Thanks for your insight though."
"Having just left a review for a breakfast restaurant that I love, I thought that I would take a moment to write a review for one that was a bit of a disappointment. I only knew about this place from walking by it on Michigan Avenue. To be fair I hadn't heard anything about it at all. I just assumed that it must be good based on the size of the crowd I often see waiting outside. My first problem, as is the first problem with all disappointing restaurants, - the service was awful. Normally I give hostesses and waitresses the benefit of the doubt because I was there once and I am fully aware that sometimes it is simply impossible to serve all your tables well, especially when the place is packed and you are short on staff. The problem here was we went on Tuesday, late in the morning, and we w"
"This place is a gem! ?Disguised as a casual deli, the food is some of the most innovative and delicious in town, and the service is extremely personal. I've sampled each meal they offer - breakfast, dinner, and I've been to two of the underground dinners now. ?For breakfast, everything is tasty, but whatever you get, make sure you order a cup of coffee or a latte to go with it - you'll never drink Starbucks again!For the regular dinners, you won't go wrong with any of the entrees, but be sure not to pass up the Martini Special appetizer - usually a special risotto that's to die for.And, by all means, make a special evening out of the the underground restaurant experience! ?Relaxed and intimate, it's a unique and perfect way to spend an evening with friends or a date!"
"Mmm mmm good! ��Great to have this place in the hood. ��Headed back again soon. ��Solid beer and wine selection, great food. ��I was most impressed however with the service. ��Staff was great."
"The best thing about this place is the byob policy. ��I went with a small group the polenta, which wasn't very good to be honest. ��I wouldn't recommend. ��My pasta dish was pretty good, altough it's loaded with heavy sauce (and the portions were huge). ��My friend ordered the gnochi and it was amazing. ��I would definitely get that again. ��All things considered we had a good time, the food was good, but not great. ��I'd probably go back and give it another shot."
"I just realized that I've been coming here almost every week for 16 years. I don't know whether the chef is still the same, but their steak burrito is still affordable ($6), huge and very tasty as it's always been. ��My wife usually gets shrimp a la Veracruzana (about $12), which is great if you like them spicy. �� This place has been renovated last year and has new, much better bathrooms. ��It's clean and has friendly staff, very fast service, and the waiters will never give you ""this is not my table"" crap, so if you ask any of them for anything you need, it will be there soon. ��Our favorite waitress is Astrid, very dedicated and polite, always smiling. You can often see cops eat there, which is a definite sign of tasty and affordable food. �� The ��two hidden jewels: 1. Best flan in Chicago! "
Gilt is an interesting place. Good food (but usually salty). The menu doesn't seem to change that often so it's great if you're going more for the alcohol.. Good service. ��I wonder if this'll be one of those hot places 'til it's not.
"I dined at Ruth's Chris in Chicago last night and wanted to comment on my service experience. The food was as exceptional as always (the ribeye cooked to perfection, seasoned appropriately, hot plate!!!), but the service was what separated this experience! From the beginning, the hostess to the bussers treated me and my guest as VIPs. I must have heard my name recited a dozen times throughout service. Every detail, from my water being constantly refilled to my napkin being refolded after I excused myself from the table, was exceeded! Not only did my guest and I enjoy the attention and service we received from the staff, we also had a great discussion with the manager about the history of Ruth's Chris (Ruth was a VERY impressive woman). My guest and I were truly appreciative of the genuine "
Had a wonderful dinner and went with the suggestions from our server. Excellent. Were seated right on time and service was great. It is a little noisy but in a way it adds to the fun atmosphere. Definitely will return.

Great
"Food was bland, especially the meat being extremely cold, and way too salty, ��the service was much like you'd find in a Dennys, They we're nice, but didn't care, like they're all there to make money and get you in and out ... ��this is by far the worst Brazilian steak house I've ever been to and I've tried them all. ��Don't waste your time or appetite here...If you want a better deal and much better quality food, go to Brazzaz. They're meat is 100% better than this place. Do yourself a favor and go to Brazzaz and you'll see!"
"Terribly rude staff. I'll never go there again.Felt like I was under Nazi control, with their constant directives. Others sitting around us felt the same way.Staff also shouldn't drink on the job. I found that low-class.I don't care how legendary a bar is, there's no cause for the employees to behave in this manner."
My husband and I went to Lockdown on a Sunday around 4:30 ��and had a great experience. ��We each had a burger (he had the Electric Chair and I had the Ponzi Scheme). ��I had mine cooked medium and it was perfectly cooked and very juicy. ��I also had one of their $4 bloody mary's and it was great. ��The place was not very busy but the bar was almost full and there was one other table of people. ��The service was great. ��I think we had 3 or 4 people check on us to ask if we needed anything after our food was served. ��I will definitely go back again. ��My husband also had a side of mac and cheese and it was good.
"Simply amazing! The best Neapolitan style pizza I have had outside Italy. ��I have both lived in Italy (Rome) as well as visited Italy many times and Spacca Napoli utterly nails true wood fired chewy Neapolitan pies. ��Spacca Napoli was actually referred to me by my co-worker's wife who was born in Naples, Italy. ��On her recommendation I went with friends last spring and absolutely fell in love with the place. ��I have been back nearly a dozen times since and the quality of the pizza has been constantly superb.I last visited on Valentines day for a Sunday lunch. ��I had just started dating my girlfriend and wanted to take her out somewhere casual and not too over the top since it was a relatively new relationship. ��Spacca lived up to the bill and then some! ��It really is my go to place for a f"
"As always, Simply It knocked it out of the park!! While the chicken pho is usually my go to, I decided to try the vegetable and dumpling soup. Their dumplings and soups ?are both amazing, so how could I go wrong? Total home run! The vegetables were fresh and crisp and the dumplings were delightful! I also love the tofu spring rolls, mostly bc they are 3 of my favorite foods all rolled up together: veggies, noodles, tofu. Yes, I'm weird I really do love tofu. I had the opportunity to actually travel to Vietnam this past fall, and let me tell you, this place is legit! Simply It is definitely not your typical Americanized Vietnamese food! Another reason that I felt compelled to write a second review is that I have never patronized a restaurant that values its customers as much as Simply It do"
"OMG, I could cry! ��I just found out tonight that my fav ethiopian rest closed and so I went to Demera instead for take out and it was HORRID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ��Honestly the worst food I've had in ages! ��We spent $30 on two entrees and only one was edible, and I'm using the term loosley. ��The other was the worst zil zil tibs I've ever seen. ��I knew, even before I dared to taste it, that it was going to be the toughest, worst beef EVER and I was SOOOOOOOOOOOO right. ��Wah! ��This was a MAJOR let down and total waste of money! ��BOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I went here for the first time on friday and boy was I suprised. ��I had heard a lot of things about this place but when i get there I was more than satisfied. ��The food was excellent; i had the wild boar sloppy joe and the oxtail and scallops. ��I skipped the dessert because i was too full by that point. ��Also, the drinks were fantastic. ��I had one of their Yuzu Hot Toddy's. ��Yum Yum. ��I highly recommend checking it out."
Always enjoy to hang out with friends. ��Love their beer. ��They have a ton of beers.!!! & wine. ��I would like to give them 10 STARS ��if I could.!!!
"Super-delicious dining experience. ��Friendly, helpful wait staff. ��I've tried about 5 different pizzas and three appetizers [so far - I will be back!]. ��Creative combinations of toppings and fresh ingredients on to-die-for crust. ��This is not Chicago pizza, folks. ��The crust is light and slightly chewy with that wood burned, smoky flavor. ��Pizzas arrive in about 5 minutes. ��Excellent prosecco. ��But forget all that, what you really need to have is the Tiramisu. ��The best ever."
"This restaurant bourbon bar is the dazzling pride of Logan Square. ��It holds its own with the best restaurants on Randolph St. and Downtown. ��I remember when it used to be the Winds Cafe,local dive bar, but they've taken it to a ��whole new evolution. ��The mouth watering dishes come out of a kitchen smaller then what I have at home, and the staff is incredibly welcoming and attentive. ��The whole bar is soft lit and warm, but be advised that you will have a long long wait for a table just about any time of the week in the evenings. ��Just give your name and number to the Host/Hostess and they can call you when your table is ready. ��The 3$ bourbon shot list feels like a gift, and the bartender can always give good recommendations if you are unfamiliar with any of the labels. ��There are true ge"
"This used to be my favorite restaurant ever, but has gone so far downhill, I tell everyone I know to do themselves a huge favor and stay away. ��Rick Bayless used to care about building a reputation and serving quality food and drinks, but it is so evident now that he cares only about making tons of money. ��I've taken visitors who were dying to eat at Frontera, early, before it gets busy, and late, after the crowds thin out, and the experiences have been consistently bad.The food is incredibly salty. ��The margarita proportions are off: where is that great older gentleman bartender? He was the only one who knew how to make a margarita and talk to customers. The bartenders there don't have the technique down, or they have switched to cheaper tequila, or something...but the drinks are not good"
Went to Mercat on my Birthday back in June. ��I was not disappointed at all. ��Ordered the Chef's selection and loved every plate!
"This is way too expensive for eh Italian. ��My nonna was born in Italy, so I eat more Italian food than I'd care to admit (and my butt shows it)...but I love it more than any other food. ��The food isn't inedible, but it's not great. ��Particularly for the price. ��And the service. ��On a pretty empty night I waited at the stand for at least 5 minutes, all the while making contact with 2 servers who were stopping to put down his/her glass of water or grab a rag, until someone asked if I'd been helped. ��The food was not worth the wait. ��Even the bread was stale.There is a reason this place is always on http://Restaurant.com, TwoBuckDuck, etc. ��Because it's not a place to seek out."
"This afternoon I went to Yolk with my college sign language class. ��We were to order as deaf people would order, which mostly means pointing at the menu. ��Our waiter didn't have a problem with this until he gave me the wrong order and forgot my drink. ��Not only did he give me a major attitude while handing me my correct order, but he charged me for all of it. ��When I went up to the front to pay, I explained the situation and received the most rude behavior I have ever experienced from anyone. ��He basically told me it wasn't their problem and said ""the next time you want to be heard, you should just speak"". ��I was astounded to be spoken that way. ��This clearly was an issue not only of incompetence, but of discrimination. ��After roughly handling the situation, he shooed me off. ��I would neve"
"This place is great! ��I don't make it here often because its not near any public transportation and usually has a long line but every time I do I remember that its worth it. ��I can't believe top chef didn't come here, and that they did a hot dog challenge in NYC, wtf."
"This place is great! Some of the best Mexican food I have had in Chicago...and I had my fair share out west and in the southwest. The chips are okay but the food is great! The margaritas are also awesome. Get the Jamaican Flower margarita if you like cherry...it is stellar! Not the mention, the staff is extremely friendly. :)"
"The ingredients here (most important part of a pizza of course) are always top-notch. I am thoroughly convinced Art of Pizza has the best deep-dish in the city. Admittedly I've only ever tried like three other places, but I've never been disappointed by a deep-dish slice here. Environment is chill, cute, and informal (not tacky or too casual though, so informal on the nicer side) and it's nice on the wallet, ��too -- especially for its quality!"
"I wasn't a fan of the neighborhood, but I heard great thing's about this place. Yep, they were right! I WILL BE BACK :)Everyone who worked there were very nice & welcoming!Food was good. I had thai & sushi. Both were good. They even made something for me that wasn't on the menu. Which is ALWAYS a huge plus.The decor was very cute too."
"both 90 mile locations are really good. the beans and rice are so savory, that you could just eat them as a meal, but then you'd miss out on the delicious ropa vieja or bistec and plantains. unlike many cuban places, there are quite a few great vegetarian options, i like the tofu and i love the vegetable empanada. yuca frita is also good and nothing is too heavy or greasy. great food, great prices."
"Living in Albany Park for five years, i know all of the Kabob places in this area. And i have to admit, Noon O Kabab is my favorite for a fine dining. Everybody complains about prices. Well of course if you want something worthy and good quality the price will be high. I once spoke to the owner, and i was amazed of what he does to keep his food the best. The guy actually hired, yes PAYED an inspector to COME and inspect his restaurant. I was there, and shocked. And if you had a bad plate, don't blame the restaurant, probably the chef is new or something. Try the place at least twice before trashing it on here."
"Absolutely outstanding all around. The food is ridiculous, the wine list matches and is affordable, the outdoor patio is amazing, and the service is a total 10. The owners take great pride in their food & their restaurant and how it is run from top to bottom. For sure the best Italian restaurant in chicago right now. Great work guys."
"The food is good here, but I worked at this restaurant for a significant amount of time (over 40 hours a week for 5 months). The owner did not pay us our full salaries. He often hires girls without green cards so he can take advantage of them. He hopes the girls that work there will be too scared to question him and knows they have little legal discourse. When I finally demanded the $1300 in back pay he owed me, Bell fired me. He harrasses and steals from his employees and I genuinely hope you will not patronize this restaurant. Yes, the food is tasty, but as for basic human rights-supporting this restaurant is supporting a man who takes extreme advantage of his employees and pads his pocket with their hard earned wages. Please don't help a dishonest and thieving man make money on the back"
"Being from New York and having tried Bon Chon, UFC, Cheogajip, Kyochon chicken, it was a nice surprise to have found Crisp. I read their review on Time Out Chicago and had to check it out.We ordered one of the Buddha Bowls, Marty's Mushrooms, and 10 wings. Now realize that 10 wings at Crisp is 20 wings anywhere else at half the cost! We got the wings half sassy and half BBQ by recommendation of one of the owners, Doug. ��I was able to pick the veggies of my choice for the Buddha Bowl and got it with tofu. The veggies and seasoned perfectly.The chicken was OUTSTANDING. the outside was ridiculously crispy and the inside moist and juicy. They were not smothered in sauce like at Cheogajip. The sauces complimented the chicken really well. ��Thinking of the chicken right now 2 days later makes my "
"Service was ok, food was great! Im happy. I was in a hurry, so couldnt spend much time here, but the blue crab spring rolls were to die for. It took a little long for my server to bring my check, but it was my fault for not telling him that I was in a hurry. I will be back. I would like to bring my grandma here for dinner next week."
"Horrible service. Food comes out one at a time and forgot the rest of food that was ordered. when asked the manager after waiting for oNe hour he started yelling asked to wait . Didn't even apologies for their mistake. Doesn't even come around to fill the water. Terrible and disaster service provided. Never will return. TERRIBLE!!!!HORRIBLE, they all need to get some restaurant management ��training."
It would have been 4 stars but the waiter thought he could triple the gratuity for our party of 14 and no one would notice. ��Thats just shady and theres no way in hell I believe that to be an accident.I would definitly return for the food.....A+
"First things first...I love breakfast food. It's one of those foods that's pretty hard to get wrong, but when a place like yolk does breakfast very very right, it's amazing!This place is very modern and trendy; my roomate and I first ventured out here in hopes of stalking cute columbia boys, since that's pretty much the croud this place attacts. The decor is very modern, and all egg inspired; very kitschy and cute.Their portions are huge! Everything's so good that my roomie and I usually each ordre a plate and then share all the food...it's like our own personal breakfast buffet. Everything I've had there is delicous! Pancakes are awesome; omelts are very good too! They have some interesting juice flavors too.Unfortantly the wait for tables can get pretty long, which is to be expected with"
"Here are my issues with this place, which I hope will be helpful when you visit.My last visit was the second time at this place, and the same issue happened. ��There were six of us who came in. ��Nothing in the menu said that for a party of 6 or more, gratuity will be included. ��Below is a diagram of our bill:$169.00 - Subtotal �� ��16.50 - Tax (9.76% of subtotal)-------------$185.50 - Total, including tax �� ��38.05 - Service chg (gratuity, 22.51% of subtotal OR 20.51% of total)-------------$223.55 - Total with Service chgFirst of all, I'm not stupid. ��Except for this place, ALL restaurants I've been in charge a maximum of 18% gratuity, and they base it on the subtotal before taxes, not on the taxed total. ��I asked the manager why the large gratuity, and she said that's how they do it in their "
Before I moved to Chicago Piece was my husband's favorite pizza place. ��He said he would order from there weekly. ��The few times we have had it recently it has been extremely greasy and just makes us feel gross for eating it.
"This place is a really nice addition to the ever evolving stretch of Milwaukee ave this bar calls home. I love the IPA's they brew here, solid food choices as well. Can't beat the $12 growler fill up for take home."
By far my favorite Chicago Style Pizza... I make a point of stopping there when I am in the city.
"Every dish ordered was delicious. Our waiter was great. We were allowed to split dishes. The Tiramisu was outstanding, and I normally don't like it. We had a great table outside. Everything was fresh and homemade tasting. I am glad I found a yelp review telling me to go there!"
"Saw this place first on Check Please. ��We drive 30 minutes most Sunday's for brunch. ��It's our favorite. ��The line sometimes seems long, but it moves. ��Contrary to the main post - my kids love it. ��Salmon Bagel, Pancakes - a must!!! ��Everything is great down to the mochas. ��Try the baked goods or a strata - the more adventurous your choices, the more pleased you'll be."
"Fox and Obel has some great produce. The meat is some of the best in Chicago, the range of deli product is also great. The seafood used to be great but nowadays it is exactly the same stuff as whole foods just 30% more expensive, they have stopped carrying anything exotic and a lot of the fish on display has seen better days.The biggest issue I have with this store is customer service, I visit there regularly and continually have trouble getting served and/or checking out. This would be fine if it was a budget store but every product is marked up 20% + compared to other stores so you are paying purely for their profit not for appropriate customer service."
"When we visited, we LOVED this place! ��The portions are HUGE, so SPLIT something! ��The staff was wonderful and FAST, and so was the food. ��Omelettes are huge, amazing, and tasty, and the potatoes are good too. ��mm mmm mm"
"Indeed, this restaurant is as good as it gets from culture, service and ambiance to, certainly, the food. On this evening, I accompanied a rather large group of my fellow bon vivant culinary adventurers to Little Bucharest. From the very moment of arrival we were all in a giddy state of mind. Having dined in many places in Europe it felt incredibly familiar and welcoming. With a little jostling among the young wait staff as we began to be seated, the owner soon made an introduction and we earnestly began to line up plate after plate to share of apps and entrees. Sharing a meal with a large group on a budget can be a little frantic but we all enjoyed EVERY dish. Most memorable were the house-made sausages, the fish and goulash. Seriously, everything was absolutely great. In the background w"
I love this place! ��Stuffed pizza by the slice! ��And the pan and thin pizza is great too!
"Food was good, but nothing that sets Anteprima apart from the myriad neighborhood Italian places in Chicago.We will not go back. We showed up 10min early for a 9pm reservation. The place was buzzing--always a good sign late on Sunday evening--and as a result they were ""running 10-15min behind"". No problem--10-15min is a wash--but by the time we got seated it was almost 10pm. Kitchen was winding down so it was 10:30+ before food arrived.Orechiette were nicely al dente but the lamb sausage was lukewarm and very oily. Calamari was also on the cool side and somewhat underdone, although the fregola/peas mix made up for it. OK, let the average food slide but, note to server: please, no attitude when telling me ""We don't do fettucine here""."
"I'm a big fan of Japanese food and have been to different Japanese restaurants in Chicago. I'll say Wakamono is one of the worst I've ever been to. My boyfriend brought me to Wakamono for my birthday and I was kinda looking forward to this dinner at first after reading the reviews at yelp. The restaurant look nice, but the food is really bad. We ordered a seared tuna for appetizer, 3 rolls and a couple nigiri. The appetizer is alright, not anything surprise thou. The rolls were bad! They put unagi sauce on every roll they made, which make all the rolls tasting the same. The worst is they put on really A LOT of sauce, making the rolls taste salty. I can't really tell what I am eating except unagi sauce. For the nigiri, it's not good either. The sashimi is not fresh and the rice is not firm."
Tru is among the Chicago elite in restaurants. ��Featuring glass staircases of ��caviar and other eclectic twists on nouveau cuisine. The menu is constantly changing and is dependent on seasonal availability of items. The decor is dramatic with dark rich black tones coupled with crisp white tablecloths and hints of blue accents. Tru is very adult oriented so not a family place but great for a small group or date for those who have a global palate.
"Drooling again, sorry, gotta wipe up my keyboard. I wanna go back to those duck fat fried cheese fries. And that chicago hotdog, with that fresh bread and lettuce, mustard mayo. ketchup. What I don't wanna go back to is that freaking line. I didn't think it would be that cold outside and the line so Long. The only time I can drop by is the same time those other people can drop by. You guys try staying outside in the could. Doug's - you better open up another local branch. I can wait for that. I can't stand going there and waiting in line out in the cold. I feel like a hobo lining up for a good meal."
"I was visiting from Texas and was taken to the Little Bucharest Bistro for my birthday. ��We don't have original Romanian restaurants in Texas. ��I liked the personal touch from the owner and the waitress was in training. ��The food was authentic, delicious and well served. ��I am sure my relatives in Chicago who took us there will be regular customers."
"I have had the beef sandwich which was tasty so decided to try the pizza. I ordered an individual pizza, temperature was tepid at best and crust dry and chewy. I later found out these pizzas are ""pre-made"". Really? I should have realized something was odd when the pizza was brought out soon after we were seated. I'm not sure I will give them my business as I'm wondering where else they take ""shortcuts"" Yuck!"
"We have been fans of Indie from almost the beginning. My partner eats sushi and I do Thai. We dine here weekly, and always with pleasure. We have watched as Indie has expanded the space, the menu, and the program: jazz night and wine tastings. We have loved them through out their growth. These are ��two involved owners who are very much concerned in bringing the diner the best experience, so please feel free to tell them of any deficiencies or compliments. They have tried to anticipate the tastes and concerns of the contemporary diner at an affordable price."
"I've been to a few churrascarria restaurants in the past, but nothing tops the Texas de Brazil on Ohio St. in Chicago. The castle-inspired interior of the restaurant was absolutely breathtaking and the salad bar (should really be called appetizer bar) offers something for every single craving you may have. Gourmet cheeses, meats, salads and even sushi are among the 75 + items that are offered. Make sure to pace yourself, because once your card is flipped to 'green' on your table, the gauchos will come in hoards, offering an array of Brazilian-style cooked meats. I tried every one of them and could honestly not tell you my favorite!The most entertaining part of my evening was the 'aerial wine artist' which, leotard-clad, soar through the two-story see through wine cellar to retrieve wine fo"
"solid food, good scene"
"Very mediocre. For a restaurant that prides itself on using fresh ingredients and unique suppliers, I find it odd that the food tastes very ""diner ��- esque"". On many occasions, I find the staff uninformed on the menu and very aloof. Also, for the pricetag, I will spend my money elsewhere, where I am guaranteed a great meal with freshly bought and prepared ingredients."
Everything here is amazing. Best vegetarian/vegan restaurant in the city HANDS DOWN. I would totally marry the gyros from this place....but it would just be a trick to eat her whole family at the reception.
"Worst... never had such an experience... not the food but the staff. I called them in the morning to order a delivery for 5:40 PM and 1st they kept me on hold while they were making fun about eachother and talkin which i could listen clearly.I didn't receive the pizza on time so when i called them they kept me in hold for 10 min... and they said that the delivery guy is in the building and i went around looking for the delivery guy all over the building as this was for the class and had to be there before lecture, i din't find any so i waited for another 20 min and again when i called they asked me to be in hold and i mentioned regarding delivery and now she was rude saying that she wants me to hold... anyways i was on hold for another 10-15 min and she finally said that the order i placed"
"Great food, fast service, great prices. Shouldn't be missed."
"great decor, and great atmospehere. ��def maeks me wan t to go to brazil soon. definitely try their meat platters. �� I loved the attemtion that we recieved from our server. ��off the indian food and on to brazilian steak houses after this."
"The service, wine, food was all superb! Just delicious! The crab cakes are perfect, scallops are flavorful and don't you dare go without getting butter cake for dessert. It is amazing. The only recommendation I have would be to order your steak a little under cooked. I ordered mine medium rare, but it was slightly overdone, due in part to the delivery on the hot, buttery plate. It was still delicious, just not *perfect*. Another's steak was a touch undercooked, so a little inconsistent! We had a wonderful experience. ��I also appreciated the call they made to follow up on the dinner. Very nice touch."
"I felt like I was in italy from the decor to the menu! ��This place is great! ��We had the borrata cheese to start with, it was so creamy and then had an assortment of olives and proscuitto. ��I went for the pizza marghrita which was amazing! ��I have been there about 3 times in the last month and will going back for more!"
Food is absolutely wonderful! An authentic Italian restaurant with amazing food! Its a local hot spot which is always busy on the weekends! My only issue is with how loud the first floor can be! So I usually end up on the second floor which is much more quiet. Great place!!
Seriously the best mac and cheese in town. They also have great drink specials on Thursday. During the winter this has become a go to place for me. They could add a few new things to the menu to spice things up a bit.
A friend and I went to the Gage for lunch last Friday-service was exceptional and I really enjoyed the fish and chips. Will certainly come back to this restaurant.
"If the wait weren't so long, this is an easy five star review. ��The place is out of control awesome as I consider it my favorite gourmet mexican on the continent. ��I recommend this place to everyone. ��As a suggestion: ��get all apps (instead of a dinner) and do not under any circumstances leave without getting a dessert."
"I think I must have lived in Chicago in a former life because ever since first visiting it in 1995, it has always felt like home to me each time I return and I try & return a lot! ?Anyway - on to Calo's. ?I was introduced to this restaurant about 3 years ago by a dear friend who lives in the area and that was my first encounter with little pillows of heaven called Asiago (or Gorgonzola) gnocchi. ?There are literally not descriptive enough words to describe the flavor sensations provided by those little morsels. ?To be honest, I didn't notice much about anything else (ambiance, service staff, other food) even though I've been back several times until my last visit on February 20th, 2010. ?This visit was exceptional in every way. ?Had a reservation for 8:30 but arrived a little early and spe"
My friends and I come here often after work. ��The atmosphere is great-you forget you are in Chicago with the lively music and well adorned back patio. ��I have never had anything that I don't like. ��A friend of mine who claimed not to like Cuban food even said the sandwich was the best sandwich she's ever had.
"Its official: I've dumped IHOP for Nana's.I discovered this place when a friend scheduled a breakfast date for a small group of us on a Monday morning. ��When I arrived there was a few other folks there and no wait--we even hung around chatting after our meal was complete--something we probably would not have done if there was a wait for a table. ��I ordered a short stack of buttermilk pancakes and a soy latte. ��The waitress arrived to the table grumbling that they got the espresso drinks confused and my latte had a shot of vanilla, she placed the steaming cup in front of me and asked me if I really wanted her to change it. ��I felt this is not a question to be imposed on a paying customer--she really left me with little option--and had it not been for the exceptional pancakes with real butte"
"Seriously, one of the two best $10 lunches in town. The other is Hot Doug's. Spicy Falafel, Lamb Shawerma, Lentils and Rice, it makes me forget where I'm from and get all hot for Mediterranean food.Really, it should get four stars, for the horrible music and smelly hipsters crowding in, but the food is that good, and priced right."
"Crisp is hands down awesome. ��Their BBQ chicken wings are perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of fried. ��I also highly recommend the Magic Mushrooms, which are battered and fried and come with Crisp's amazing dipping sauce. ��The staff is friendly and laid back and the food comes out pretty quickly. ��Love this place!"
Love it. If you like burgers and Rock and Roll(and I do) then you will love this place. Must do if you have friends in town.
"This place rocks! ��The food is good, but I'm sold on the tallgrass burger. ��I'm giving this place an extra star for serving so many beef dishes with grass feed beef. ��This burger is absolutely my favorite burger in Chicago. ��I love the decor too."
"I'm always in the mood for Grand Lux. ��This is so much better than the cheesecake factory that I'm not even sure why anyone bothers to go to the cheesecake factory anymore. The wait can be long, but I'm so happy once I start eating that I forget I waited so long. Make sure you order some of their cookies to take home with you...yum!"
"I had to write to let people know how wonderful Spacca Napoli and its owner John is! ��I can call myself a foodie bk I love to eat good food and ��I know how rare it is to experience a restaurant with a soul... ��John and his wife have poured their hearts and soul into Spacca Napoli and the result is exceptional food and a warm welcoming atmosphere. ��i recently installed a pizza oven and was having a party on a sat evening but had a ? about the dough. ��I had visited Spacca Napoli in the past and was very impressed with the pizzas so I decided to give them a call and ask some advice. ��The response from John was surprising and refreshing. ��He asked how soon I could be there and when I arrived we sat down, he offered me some wonderful soup and began a tutorial including history and hands on tips"
"I have never had anything like this food (which is too generic a word) and I loved every bite.I am not edgy or cool and this place is very edgy and cool and yet I was completely at ease and comfortable. ��The music is not my taste and I didn't know any of the artists, but the thing I liked about it was it created privacy in a small space. ��My conversation was heard by the person who was intended to hear it. ��It also complemented the energy of the kitchen. ��And maybe the intended effect was to even out any energy differential between the kitchen and the dining room. ��I thought it did and it was fun.This place also reminded me of really talented people who decide to do a stint in the public sector to hone skills and act upon some principal of their personality. ��If I had to guess at the princ"
"1.) Great Food - Amazing dill rice and very generous portions. The pan seared white fish was delicious. 2.) Very nice waitress and staff. Made my wife, 3 sons and I feel right at home. The hostess had a great smile and was able to seat us right away.3.) The restaurant is small enough for an intimate lunch/dinner but it was not crowded. Plenty of table space to accommodate all the wonderful dishes. 4.) Reasonably priced. I did not spend more than I would on a meal for 5 than I would at any other chain restaurant. 5.) Child friendly. I guess as well as your children all well behaved and exhibit manners. We did not feel uncomfortable bringing the children in. 6.) Food portion is awesome! 1 plate is enough for two people. Get ready to take some home!I will definitely return very soon. I will a"
Steaks here are good! I love getting my steaks crusted. I also love the shrimp appetizer. Service is also great.
"I recently moved from LA to Chi town and was searching for a Vietnamese place to satisify my cravings. ��This place is the best!! ��I was definitely impressed by the food and the service. ��I've been here at least once a week since I've discovered this place about over a month ago. ��This restaurant is clean and has a nice atmosphere that I would take my in-laws for some authentic Vietnamese cuisines.I've had various dishes and they are all tasty and true to its Vietnamese heritage. ��Of course because the owner and cooks are Vietnamese! ��Spring rolls are a bit americanized but still yummy plenty and healthy. ��Pork chops from lunch combo were so yummy and filling - had to take the rest home because they give you two cutlets. ��Their lunch combos are a steal. ��You can't get soup, salad, drink and"
"Overrated and disappointing. I ordered the traditional eggs benedict. What they call Canadian Bacon was a quarter inch slab of dense, flavor-free pork product, which was rivaled in rubberiness by the incredibly resilient English muffin underneath. No wonder they gave me the biggest steak knife I'd ever seen. Sauce was bland. Sides were tasteless. Even the orange juice seemed weak. My friend's omelet was equally disappointing, and three quarters of it was left untouched. Service was OK."
best brunch in chicago!
"BEER BLISS!!!Do not let the outside fool you! It looks a little dicey on the outside, but heaven awaits on the inside. And apparently, everyone else in Chicago agrees.You have to time going to this restaurant just right. ��My friend and I were aware of this when he and I went, so we got there at 6:00p.m. on the dot and we were still too late. We assumed since it was pouring rain, the wait wouldn't be as long. WRONG!The problem with this place is that it's so small and cramped that even when you're waiting for your table, it is incredibly inconvenient because you're always in someones way. Unless you're lucky enough to score a seat at the bar which after 15 minutes of waiting, we did. I couldn't tell you how many new and incredible beers I had that night. I can tell you I was feeling good an"
Best Hot Dawg you will ever eat! ��I personally love the little green tomatos on the side!
"6 words - TRUFFLE EGG TOAST, TO DIE FOR!!! ��I have been here twice and can't wait to go again. ��It's all about a memorable dish that brings me back. ��I have dreams about their truffle egg toast!!!! ��I love going out to eat!!!! ��The truth is that we have so many places to try in Chicago. ��It's nice to go to places that know what they are doing with food, service and overall ambiance. ��You can taste the love and passion in their food. ��It's amazing! ��And dying to try the Sea Urchin Pasta. The last time I went they were out. ��You must go. ��Once you do, you will be planning your return. ��Not kidding."
Mussels. o yeaBeer. o yeaDont ask for a miller light
"This is my third time going..... and after my first great experience I didn't think it could get better but it DID.... better service, better drinks, and more sushi to choose from. LOVE this place."
"We love this place for a Friday night dinner with the kids. ��Usually I like to try new things when we go out to eat, but here I always get the salad bar, hot wings, and a banana milkshake. ��The kids meals are wonderful - they come with these bendy stick things that keep my kids occupied during the entire visit. ��The atmosphere is fun and friendly. ��Be sure to make a reservation because the wait can be long!"
"It opened great and has now gone downhill. The fish and chips used to be light and crisp and now it's just a limp, greasy mess. The original friendliness is gone, too. It seems alot noisier, with drunk Trixies screeching with their gal possies, ruining everyone else's time."
My favorite japanese/ Asian restaurant! The sushi is the best (and I am very particular) and the service is impeccable.The drinks are just as great as the food.I had a margarita special- it was a cucumber base w a kick. It was the best drink ever. I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed.
"After a movie date at a nearby theater, my date & I didn't have any idea where to go afterwards. We got out to the parking lot and saw a pizza place so we decided to check it out. We walked into Pequod's and were digging the environment. More importantly, we were really impressed with the pizza. The deep dish was the perfect portion and the price was really good. I'm talking, I checked the bill to see if the server rang up the wrong thing. It was great pizza and the price was astoundingly good. I can't wait to go back."
"AHHH Superdawg I LOVE this place. ��Born and raised in Chicago, Ive tried all the standard joints...and this one will always be my fave. ��Their beefy hot dog is soooo good. ��The fries are so crispy and delicous. ��And the shakes are THICK. ��Yeah yeah, maybe its a little pricier but youre getting what you pay for. ��If you have people in from out of town, bring them here for sure."
Why bother even writing a review. ��It's all been said. ��Delicious and inventive!This is the spot I bring my out of town friends to show off a Chicago gem!
Always a great experience. ��Get the Ropa.
"no only are they the best dogs, the cheese fires are to die for, If they had a liquor license I'd move in. yummmmm, cant waite till they branch closer to the city."
"Having just had a great time with friends here last night, I felt the need to share how wonderful this place is. Last night was a typically great night at The Violet Hour. The hostess for the night did our routine ID checks and when she saw mine, she wished me a happy b-lated bday. Then, I remembered how I should have reviewed the night of my 30th birthday on Saturday Dec. 18th at this wonderful establishment:I showed up early as I had been here before and knew I had to be here at open if I had a chance of sitting in the back area with a decent sized group. I showed up with 10 people and with 6 more on the way to meet me. The hostess for the night was completely amazing. She offered to split our group and knowing this was a special night she made sure all my friends knew where I was seated"
"Coast sushi has some of the best sushi in the Chicago area. Its fresh and reasonably priced. I also love the fact that its BYOB. The only reason my review didn't get 5 stars is because the last time I was there our waiter was a jack ass. I went with 5 people and we asked to split the check with 4 credit cards. Our 5th person only had cash so she asked him for change for a $20. He replied with, I'm sorry but I don't have change for you....what restaurant doesn't have change for a 20? It was ridiculous and he argued with us for about 5 minutes until we got fed up and had to go to a manager for change. It was weird a ridiculous."
"The food is delicious, but they can certainly do better on the service. If you go there, don't expect to be treated nice. Remember that restaurant with the bitchy waitress???? Yep. That's the one I am talking about. ��Think about that restaurant, then you won't be disappointed. Overall, If you are in just for the good food, it is the place for you. If you like to be pampered, go someplace else. There are others in the area."
"The staff is too cool for school. The food is average($11 burgers that taste like the $7 burgers you can get down the street at Logan Bar). The Brewery is a complete novelty, If it was bottled and sold at a liquor store, You would never buy it. Overall this place would fit in much better on Division street, hype, attitude and more hype."
"This place is fantastic. If your looking for a fun upscale restaurant -bar downtown, look no further. It's a bit loud but your can ask for a table in the rear where it's quieter. There's not a bad item on the menu and if you love mussels there's are great. I look forward to returning soon."
Fantastic food in a cozy environment. ��The chef was very nice and it was great to get to talk to him during the meal.
"One of the best burgers in Chicago!Not too crowded, incredible cheese curds (and the only ranch dressing I like!)Great beer list, reasonable prices....put it right up there with Kumas and the Regal Begal (yes they have an awesome juice burger!)"
"I've been screwed twice in the last two orders (for delivery). I guess this place is a victim of its own success. Most recently I ordered a thin crust 18 sauase, pepperoni pizza, and was told delivery would be 70 minutes. ��120 minutes later the guy showed up, I paid him, and then a moment later found I'd received a deep dish veggie thing. ��I hate deep dish! ��I called them, and got this run around: ""the guy is new...."" ��and ""we're really busy"" and ""we'll give you 50 pct off your next order."" ��The order I placed several weeks ago was wrong also. It's decent pizza, but I'm not putting up with their incompetence. ��Screw them."
"One of my Favorite restaurants! I come here often.I was a little upset with the remodel, it seemed to have lost it's cozy appeal and the White wall divider made it feel cold and unwelcoming. The last time that I went in though, papel picado hang from the ceiling and the environment was much improved. The food here is amazing, I am in love with the burritos, quesadillas, guac and horchata. ��My only complaint now is that some drinks run a little on the expensive side, but to split a pitcher of Margaritas (so delish) among friends is great!"
"I've only been here for brunch but I hear that dinner is really good as well. They give fresh, free beignets upon being seated, which is kind of worth a trip in itself. I can't get enough popovers, and have enjoyed every dish I've had here."
"To start, we had to reschedule our reservation because one of the couples in our party was in a fender bender on their way into the city. ��I was informed that due to their policy there would be a $200 charge for the cancellation. Excuse me? ��I understand if you were a no-show but we gave them several hours notice. ��Not only that, ��the hostess tells me she's been turning people away all night. I then queried, can't you give our table to the millions you've been turning away? She didn't get it. ��I then spoke with the Director and explained the situation and that we would reschedule in a few weeks. ��Although, it may be their ""policy"" ��it's not a good one to make a first impression for a restaurant charging exorbitant prices during a recession. Moving on to the the meal. ��Let's just say the 2n"
Was there last night. BOOO YA
"Great servie and great food. ��My gf and I have been to Sunda a couple of times. ��Both times we had a terrefic experience. ��The first visit, we sat at the bar and had some sushi and drinks. ��The bartenders were great and extremely friendly. ��The were also completely honest and persuaded me away from one of their ""signature"" cocktails, saying that it wasn't very good (in the end they made it for me free of charge!!). ��The second time we went, we took our parents. ��This time we sat near the back of the place. ��The wait staff and food was excellant! ��As a tip - you really need to make reservations if eating thursday through saturday. ��The bar is a great place to go after work with friends - but make sure to get there early, the place fills up very quick!!"
"Simply It is a fantastic restaurant! I loved the liveliness and the food was exceptional. It's BYOB which is the main reason we went there and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the atmosphere. It's loud, but I love that. I had the bean sprouts and tofu, which was the favorite dish of my table, and the other people with me enjoyed their food a lot too! The food really was great (and inexpensive). I highly recommend having a meal at Simply It if you are in the area!"
"Best jazz in the city and open late! Great decor, evidentally the original decor of the place. A little overcrowded with hipsters but it is a jazz bar so i shoulldn't have expected anything else. This place destoys all the blues bars down in the Depaul area."
"Very good food. ?Nice presentation. ?Excellent service. ? Come with a hearty appetite because there is mucho de foodo (No, I don't know Portuguese) is served. ? It seems especially popular with guys, because most tables we saw on our visit were all-guys or predominantly guys, who evidently like to eat a lot of meat. ?If you don't like meat, you probably should skip this place.It's not a place to go to every week, at least not for me. ?Plan on spending easily $60-70 bucks a head, because the main service basically comes to about $50 for the customary, salad bar and all the meat you can eat, minus beverages and dessert. ?And, those servers watch those cards on the table carefully and have effective service, so cover up your card or take it away if you are finished. ? ?Bravo."
The white dragon is the BEST. The service can be hit or miss.
"Skip the delivery. ��My friends & I ordered an extra large deep dish pizza (Calo's special) last night. ��We patiently waited over the hour for the pizza to be made & delivered. ��Once the pizza man arrived, we tipped him generously because we were so excited for our pizza & thankful he delivered it to us on a cold winter's night. ��HOWEVER, it was completely the wrong pizza. ��We immediately called the delivery man & he said that it was the correct ticket on the box. ��So we called the restaurant & the restaurant asked us what ticket number was on the box. ��Again, they came to the conclusion that the right ticket was on the box, but the WRONG pizza!!!! ��The young lady was really nice on the phone, but her manager was horrible. ��We felt that he did not want to remedy the situation and he just wa"
I visited this place recently due to really great reviews from my friends. The ambience can be described as a subdued elegance and I really enjoyed the intimate feel you get as soon as you walk inside. I had the plumb & sour cocktail which to my delight was absolutely perfect. The cheese plate I had left a little to be desired because it really didn't present anything extraordinary. Otherwise my experience was great and I would definitely come back again.
"My girlfriend, my friend and his wife celebrated NYE with carnivale. It was all we had hoped for. The drinks and food were amazing. We started out with guacamole and fish tacos. Both were so fresh and delicious. My friend and I had the steak... It was to die for. My girlfriend had the beef tenderloin with a goat cheese puree and his wife had the pork shoulder. All the food was great. They also had live entertainment to ring in the new year!!! It was well worth it!!"
"Went here last night for the second time, first time I had the soup of the day (potato leek). It was memorable enough for me to come back a year later. This time, for starters we had the cheddar artichoke dip, very good dip; not so good toasted bread, fell apart while trying to pile on the dip. The I had the super good chicken pot pie, pastry was baked around the bowl of insides, so it was piping hot. The pastry was a little bit doughy though. No hot sauce available only Tobasco pepper sauce. We also tried the blackened chicken club sandwich with avocado; very good...not the best fresh cut fries, a substitute is recommended.The decor and aesthetics of this place is awesome, fire places, leather seating, tin ceilings. Great bottled beer selection, good service ( a little too quick to box ou"
"Great gourmet grocery store. ��Thier Black Forest Ham and Piave cheese are the best I've found here in Chicago. ��Don't forget to try their cafe too. ��The french fries with Truffle oil are so rich, you'll need to share them."
"Overpriced, small portions--they actually served me a dish that was the size of a tablespoon. My boyfriend was disappointed as well--but at least he paid! The owner also supports torturing geese to make foi grai!"
"Not a good experience.... Waiter was indifferent, but worst than that was my steak n eggs were overcooked. How does a place that specializes in breakfast struggle making breakfast? Glad I went though cuz now I don't need to go back."
Anything less would be a lie. ��Believe in the power of the world's best encased meat emporium.
Bacon. Wrapped. Dates.
I love pho... especially when dining at Tank!I have never had bad experience at this restaurant.. the only downside is that it can be VERY crowded.
"Amazing. ��If you want quality food that isn't ridiculously overpriced, this is the place - their lunch special is around $12 (I think? I don't remember exactly...) and just the right size. ��And last time I was there, I ordered an appetizer that just didn't appeal to me (first time that's happened there) and they didn't charge me for it. ��I was so surprised when I got the check and saw the shrimp wrap thing I'd ordered with a note next to it - disliked - and then the money taken off. ��That's a way to get customers to come back.And whatever you do - ORDER THE PHO."
Who thought of this place? ?Mad genius at work! 50 types of Meat on stick brought around to your table so long as your stop light says green! ? AND KEEP IT COMING! ?Huge salad bar is nice but who goes fror the salad? ?The Garlic steak is my favorite that and the tendlion. ?They have chicken and sausage and other options too. ? If I had to give one negative I'd say they do push the house special ALOT. ?Special translates to - normally not the best part of the cow - but what can you do?This place just keeps pouring the meat at you. ?Just as a warning though I would stay away from this place on a date night. ?The food comma afterwards is more than a little crushing.
"Meet me in the Bar! ��The best Shaw's has to offer starts and stops in this setting. ��The perfect (yes, perfect) surroundings- bar atmosphere, fresh seafood, top notch service and oyster shooters at the ready - heaven. ��Do not ruin the experience sitting ��amoung the dinner tables...enjoy the youth and chaos of the bar. ��Oh, order up some half shell samplers, lobster bisck, and a crab cake sandwich. ��This is what we're fighting for..."
I love the crab rolls!!!! you have to be a real sushi lover to go here. these fools that order cooked fish think that is sushi? come on you wimps you have to eat it raw to enjoy sushi (and most yummy things). i will say that the bathrooms were very clean and that is a good sign that the resturant has high standards.
First experience at a Brazil Barbecue. ��Nice place and a great bargain if your a meat eater and really hungry. ��Meats were seasoned with a little too much salt though.
THe Diner is delicious and nutricious me and my boys came here on Valentines Day it wasa perfect setting to have some delicious desserts with the loved one. ��The Diner is great .
Great food and incredibly friendly owner. Fabulous lunch specials.
"If I could give this less than one star, I would.This used to be my favorite bar in Chicago, but I'm sadly going to have to revise my review. After being faithful customers since the place opened, we actually got KICKED OUT. They claimed we'd been overserved, and that's the only explanation we got. We were left shocked and bewildered, with no clue as to what we'd actually done wrong. I'm not sure when they decided to define 2 rounds of drinks as overservice, but I don't care to ever go back if that's how they're treating loyal patrons. When I asked what we'd done to deserve such treatment, I was called combative (anyone who has ever met me will know that this is a laughably, absurdly ��inaccurate characterization).I'm not going to pretend the drinks aren't delicious, but as I've found it's "
I tried this place again and the fries are still super greasythe hot dog was sour tasting and not even hotthey are way over prcedthe service is rottenthe very very long line must be people that are trying it for the first time or giving it one more chance like I didthey cannot be regular customersunless they like wasting their time and moneyand enjoy cold greasy sour tasting food.
Very disappointing experience. I was very excited to try this buzzed restaurant. Staff was very not attentitive. Food had a lot of buildup from staff/menu with mediocre flavors and execution. From the moment we walked in from the front desk to the waitstaff.....just very disappointing.
"mmmm, so tasty! The food here is sustainably farmed and raised, so it tastes real. My hubby and I split and cheeseburger (fresh, perfectly cooked, and a side of cajun fries), and the fish special (flakey, well seasoned with a fresh veggie slaw). We also had the ruhbard galette for dessert. While it is slightly pricy it is one of our new favorites."
Nice. Very nice.
"Service was great... Most amazing bartenders... Tempura French toast killed almost every artery, but sooo worth it. Great to wash it down with the mimosas."
wow. best meal of my life. absolutely amazing dinner and wonderful chefs. the chefs present each wonderfully creative dish to you at your table. some of the most imaginative dishes i have ever eaten in a small and intimate space - i couldn't wait for each course and felt lucky to be there.
love this place great food great service
"Close down the kitchen and leave the bar open, cause the pizza sucks and the beer kicks ass!Seriously, if you like pizza steer clear because this place makes me never want to even head to the east coast simply out of fear of the pizza. But that cannot be true... I hear that New England pizza is amazing. Maybe it is and maybe it isn't and if it is this place may destroy the reputation that is New England Style Pizza.More Beer! More Beer! -Fear"
"Enormous Beer List, Fantastic Burgers, at a great price. ?The wait staff was attentive and very knowledgeable about the product. ?The only thing holding it back from 5 stars is the lack of a dessert menu. ?I had the Sir Loin a burger topped with sliced sirloin and horseradish aioli, and it was worth a second trip for sure."
"Smokey, dark and not that fun. ��It's really laid back and has a dive like feel to it even though it's in such a good location. ��Not my favorite place but when the people I'm with want to go there I can make the best of it."
"This was so wonderful! It was a delight, creative, memorable and interesting. Make sure to dress up. It's hard to tell where to go in due to the lack of signage. It rates just slightly above my L2O experience. I loved that we had a menu to take home of our experience because we didn't know what we were going to eat until the servers brought it out."
Crisp has delicious food at fantastic prices. ��What more could you want?The Buddha Bowls are my favorite but the fried chicken is delicious as are the wraps. This is a great place for really good cheap eats!
This is my favorite place to eat in the city. I've tried everything and EVERYTHING is good. The mash and biscuits are the best. The meat is perfectly seasoned and cooked. Even the salad bar is a thing of wonder. Service is instant and constant. I can't think of any way in which this restaurant could be better.
"my girlfriend came home hyped up that Simply It now have sandwiches. she keeps telling me she wants to see if its better than uptowns. so we came back the weekend that just passed.the little man at the door, once again, so generous and sweet. had offered appetizers while we waited for a table. it looked pretty busy. we still got a pretty decent table though.she ordered the duck sandwich and i ordered the porkchop sandwich. both were delicious. and they have plenty other kinds. plus the fact that its only $4 a sandwich! life is beautiful. with the economy being the way it is, id say Simply It is pretty great.we also ordered the tamarind shrimp soup to share. yummm. it kind of reminds me of going to her house =). with it being...I WILL COME BACK!"
"I was in the area, so I remember reading a friend's review on this place and decided to dine here for lunch.In one word: AMAZING.For just $22, I decided to go for the three course meal featuring your choice of salad, an entree, and dessert.First, warm bread arrived freshed from the oven, and the butter that accompanied it was very tasty. The bread was delicious.My first course was the Caesar Salad with fresh shaved parmesan cheese. It was a great and satisfying salad. Definitely a great recipe and dressing.The second course is why I came to a steak house in the first place: I was served a 6 oz petit filet, and my waiter kindly reminded me that the dish was a boiling 500 degrees. The second course came with a heaping portion of mashed potatos, and at this point, I way definitely full.But I "
"Fun & delicious new age food. ?Or should we call it hipster food in River North? ? ?Anyway, they do the whole freshly picked/locally-sourced thing that seems to be all the rage lately. ? If you're picky about odd foods like I am, stay away from the bones, the marrows and other gamey-sounding dishes.... but there is something for everyone on their menu. ?And, like Owen & Engine, they make a wicked Saczerac cocktail. ? Handcrafted too! ?Valet parking, or often times lots of street parking.Beware - dark inside and loud during busy times."
Great pizza and great service made our day in Chicago fun.
brought my girlfriend there last week and as expected it was filled with people. Love the conecept of the place... Food was ok.. a large selection of wines. The service is terrible. Our server never checked up on us even though he knew it was our first time there. needless to say we wont be back and that the server didnt get a good tip. I would rather spend my money somewhere else.
"This is the end of the world when it comes to pizza in America. There is no #2. The owner has duplicated in painful detail the pizza found across the pond in Napoli. As for the bufala mozzarella pizza: in its simplicity we found perfection. And to those that are not familiar with this style of pizza: yes, the crust is supposed to be charred on the bottom. We cannot get there often, but it is worth the effort and we have never been disappointed."
"I have been to Nana's about five times. ��Three lunches and two dinners. ��I don'tunderstand the rave reviews about this place. ��While the food can at times be very good and creative, the pricing, hit & miss service and problems with the food----incomplete orders, unauthorized substituting of ingredients and inept preparation,have caused me to move on. ��There are way too many dining options in Chicagothan overpaying ay Nana's"
"We picked this restaurant with the help of other yelpers and were pleased with our pick. We had a bit of a wait which was fine b/c there was enough room to hang outside and review the menu while enjoying a glass of wine or a cold beer if desired. After waiting our expected wait time, I inquired how much longer we had as we had a prior engagement we needed to get to and we were told they would be seating several parties so we continued to wait. After about 15 people were seated, I inquired again and the hostess rudely advised that she looked for us & couldn't find us which was BS b/c we were standing where we should have been. They keep track of people by their clothing and a brief description. We were eventually seated and enjoyed a great lunch and a bottle of wine. The chorizo stuffed oli"
"Sunda has a great atmosphere and delicious food. It's a wonderful spot for a weekend or week day night. I love sushi, but if you don't you can still order many other types of dishes. I've been twice and will for sure be going back!!"
"I had a feeling that we were in for a great night before we even entered.We found a great legal parking space on Southport right by TCF bank. We walked across the street & were greeted by very attentive staff.The inside was not what I expected, then I am not sure of what I expected from the Top Chef's place.The lamb with white beans, anchovies and sausages was sensational.The wait staff suggested a wonderful wine.But my favorite thing of the night was the corn dessert was it was unexpectedly delicious. We are defineately coming back"
"When you think of Diner, one thinks middle of the road... The name fools one. There are cereal boxes on the shelves and a funk to the decor to fit with diner but the food is 5 star.. I love seafood and they specialize it it. Between certain hrs they have a seafood dinner for around 12 dollars, cannot beat that..Have been there twice, plan on going ��whenever I can.Debra"
awesome great place! love there empanadas! i recommend them!!! rice and black beans!! yum yum yum!
Went here for dinner and was it awesome. Come hungry because it's pretty much all you can eat. There are so many varieties of meat. You can pick which part you want them to cut. It's perfect. Fogo de chao is by far the best restaurant I've been to. It's definitely on the pricey side but well worth it. It's about $48 per person well for 3 of us it cost $220. But like I said its worth every damn penny
"For my taste, BEST Korean place in the city.4 stars because service can be poor to spotty."
"so ill keep this short and sweet hopefully, well my fiance and i were on our way to the cubs game, and since we didnt wanna spend a ton of money at the game we figured we would eat before the game!so i just spotted this pizza joint out the corner of my eye and i could smell the deliciousness that awaited us. so the place is cool, the cashier was super friendly the slices were like $3.43 u can get it thin crust, pan style or stuffed, so that's 3 great selections all for the same price.so we both got a pepperoni thin crust and the slice was huge i finished that slice before she could even pull out the parking lot lolthe pizza was great , i love the seasonings they used, not the doughy taste or too much sauce it was made just right and fresh, just like chicago pizza should taste!5 stars guys!"
"Had a wonderful experience with great food and awesome hospitality from my waiter Ray, very courteous and attentive. Location great, valet service helps its ��hard to find parking in Andersonville. Overall, great place to eat and to have a really nice dinner with wonderful staff ! :0)"
"This place has the best pizza in the US! ��I've lived in London and New York City and trust me when I say this is one of the top 2 pizza restaurants I have ever eaten at. ��My family and I go there almost every weekend and we never get sick of the food there. ��You will NOT LIKE their pizza if you are a fan of fatty, deep dish pizza, but if you are a fan of fresh tasting, non-greasy and extremely delicious pizza that does not make your stomach feel bloated afterwards, then this is the place to try. ��The best time to go is before 6pm. ��Otherwise there is a long wait. ��Jon, the owner, however makes the wait worthwhile because he serves up some complimentary appetizers. ��For those who love truffles, order the black truffle forcacia. ��It's not on the menu. ��It is the most heavenly dish. Yes, I've"
Their pizza is average but their customer service is horrible! I ordered a medium super-veggie which was for $25.20 but a family member was allergic to mushrooms so we told them no mushrooms and they charged us $3.00 to subtract an ingredient! I talked to the manager and told him it doesn't even make economic sense to charge a customer money for removing an ingredient. Obviously he was incapable of doing anything and give us a lot of BS of having a busy kitchen and charging extra for customizing orders. I'm never going to any Giordano's again. I don't care for the $3.00 but it's the principle!
"This place is wonderful and delicious. I was totally WOWed. Everything was great and the service was incredible. I've never been to a place where there was such nice nice people. They are truly sweet.I had came in with some friends and it was my first time there and we brought wine. They gave us wine glasses and even offered to open the bottle for us.My friends having been there already ordered for me. ��The food came out in courses which they had great timing. We ordered some fried rice, curry chicken, a beef soup, some fresh rolls, and a beef dish that came in an actual coconut! Everything was great. I will come back next time and order for myself and try some other things out."
"For real chinese food in Chicago, this is about as good as it gets. All, and I mean ALL the other restaurants in Chinatown don't get it right. ?The free cabbage at the beginning of the meal is addictive. ?The lunch menu is reasonably priced and offers a good variety. ?Even the regular menu has good, authentic dishes. ?Most importantly, the rice is always cooked well and has the proper texture. ?Too many other restaurants in Chinatown have rice that is tough and dry and maybe a day old. In terms of a Chicago Chinatown standard, the service is good. ?The servers are always attentive and they remember my special requests although I always state them just to make sure. ? This is probably the only place I would recommend for real chinese food. The one thing the kitchen can improve on is the tea"
"I have submitted many reviews to YELP for Sunda before! ��It is by far the BEST restaurant in the city (I've lived here 19 years and certainly have had my ��fix of restaurants!). �� The food is FANTASTIC, the service in unbelievable, and the partners....make sure EVERYTHING is to your liking! ��I seriously go from 1 reservation to the next with Sunda, and dining there is the highlight of my week/year!"
"I decided to give this place another chance and go to the store and place an order. I ordered a Four Cheese pizza. I am not an ""all-cheese"" pizza fan (except for this one pizzeria on Manhattan's Upper West Side ) but figured that was the best menu item to start with. I was pleasantly surprised.I think that the smell of food is just as important as the food itself. It was a good sign that the pizza smelled great and you can actually pick up some of the ingredients. The pizza had a great balance of crust to topping. The crust was light- not at all heavy and or ""powdery"". The spices were subtle, but clearly apparent and were not overpowered by the sauce or cheese. The sauce was excellent, lightly flavored and not acidic or too sweet. All the ingredients came together to make an excellent pizz"
"Having moved to Chicago from the suburbs a few years ago, Carnivale had been all anyone could talk about. Anyone who enjoys rich culture and a colorful environment both through decor and in food is sure to love Carnivale. I was hesitant at first, thinking it would be heavy on the South American-side which it is--but it works. I had a strip steak prepared in a traditional brazilian way which made a bit spicy but it was perfect.Great music and a warm environment surround you and let you take a trip to South America, minus the cost! A great place for groups and great for families with a penchant for trying something different. As the evening went on, the bar filled up and by the time we had finished dinner the scene was buzzing with young socials who came out for the night. I definitely see w"
"There's no need for a drawn out over inflated review of Doug's. ��When I contemplate going all I think of is the 1990's Nike slogan, Just Do It."
"5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I cannot rate this place highly enough. Simply it has simply won my heart over. After passing this place on the street several times I decided to try it, but not dine-in or delivery. I had a party on Saturday and thought I'd give this place a shot since they advertised that they catered. I called in and Tuan the manager on the phone was more than accommodating in taking my order, got the necessary information and that was it! Less than 10 minutes on the phone to order a huge catering menu for my party.When asked if I have tried the food before I replied no and he asked If I could come in and try a small sampling of everything I ordered. So I did and it was amazing as I imagined. So comes the day of catering and the food came promptly, hot and ready to be served. "
"Amazing service, well-prepared food, quality place. Cannot get over the genuine service. They will go out of their way to provide you a great dining experience. Have yet to have this type of experience, even at 5 star restaurants. A Must-Go if you are looking for a relaxing low-profile evening with great food."
"Crepes here are out of this world. If you like crepes and strong coffee this place is for you. I've been going to this place for over 5 years and have maybe gotten 2 bad dishes the entire time. The 'Chicago' and 'Crepa Iberica' are among my favorites on the savory side, both being filling and deliciously fresh and for dessert, you can't really go wrong the 'Aziz' which has strawberries, kiwis and nutella.Icosium really understands how to generate a great flavor profile and how to keep customers coming back. This place *is* kinda pricey but I've never felt that they overcharged. Service is great, owners are lovely, and the crepes are out of this world- light, fresh and just how they should be. Plus, this place is open a bit later than most places on Clark. Keep it up Icosium!"
i am new to town and i was told i should check out this place. i really enjoyed the music and atmosphere.GREAT JAZZ PLACE!!!!
"I live just off Diversey and I CRIED when the Sushi X near my apartment closed. ��I'm not exaggerating - we're talking big, fat, little-kid-just-lost-her-favorite-teddybear tears, as it was the BEST sushi in the neighborhood (out of like 20+ spots) and I was addicted. ��I would go every week for the happy hour and eat my fill of delicious half-priced fancy rolls on the teeny tiny patio and wallow in delight.And then it was gone.And I walked by weekly in hopes it was just a remodel, but no dice.SO my friends and I schlepped our sushi-loving asses all the way down to West Town to give the sister spot a try, because once you have had CRAB RANGOON MAKI ROLLS in your life, trust me - you cannot live without them. ��You crave them. ��You toss and turn at night wishing for them to get in your belly.

"So my friends and I have been talking about me getting on Yelp for sometime now. I LOVE going out to eat and have tried many places especially in chicago, but i have delayed it until i went to Simply it! Even after going to knwon place here like Spiaggia, Geja, or Frontera I think Simply It was one of the best dining experience i have had. We called in an made reservation on a saturday night, although we were all a bit late the owner was wonderful about it. This place is BYOB and which i think is one of the best things about places, it makes the dining experience much more affordable and you can really indulge on the food. The appetizer were a great start i would reccomen tha avocoda wontons absolutuly delicious. The entries that are avalibe were so hard to chose from there were too many t"
great food and price. service is good. one person by the name of cho needs to be trained
"DELICIOUS! They change their menu all the time and I've never had the same thing twice (in probably 15 visits). Everything I've had has been incredible. If I could afford it, I'd eat here once or twice a week. The salads are nothing special - save your appetite for the entrees. Wine is always great. Dessert is fantastic. Deifnitely need a reservation most nights of the week and it can get loud in there."
"If you are a carnivore, this is your place! You're guaranteed to leave absolutely stuffed and then feel bad because you ate so much. I loved practically all the meat there, with the Picanha being my personal favorite. They also have a really awesome salad bar, but save most of your belly space for the main course. There is also a cool bar on hand with some decent mixed drinks, but go there for the meat and you shall be pleased!"
"I have visited this restaurant twice now. ��This is not counting the bajillion times I drove past and it was very crowded. ��But to me, this is a good sign. ��I just have to stick it out. ��Here's what I have tried: Banh Mai: the BBQ pork kind. ��More robust than Ba Lei across the street. ��A great lunch sandwich.Chicken Pho: ��My sis and I also split this, the one with the wontons and mushrooms. ��The wontons were surprisingly spicy and it was a bit hard to eat. ��BUT: it was delicious. ��Lots of fresh mint and cilantro and whatnot on the side.The 177 (Self-made beef rolls): ��Shared with a friend. ��A comfortable lunch for two. ��My favorite so far.Overall, here's what I thinkPROSGreat portionsLots of choicesFRESH!Reasonable wait time on foodCONSVERY busy - avoid on weekends. ��Expect a line most nigh"
"Took my brother recently and this place did not disappoint.Great, really fresh sushi and the beef lollipops....off the chain!"
"Very impressed with the pizza and the beer was great as well! Only really draw back was that there were only two beers on tap that you could get in a pitcher? Whats up with that?A good tip is if there is a huge waiting list eat at the bar! Its first-come, first-served!"
Love it!
"This place is ex - Continental Cafe. I see that business says it is closed and now it shows up under Little Bucharest Bistro. Same owner. It used to be on Ashland before. Keeps moving the business or changing the name. I wonder why. I had a private party here. It was a nightmare. The owner promisses the moon and the stars and then he does everything in his power to rip people off. He would do anything for an extra dollar. I had an open bar. He kept disappearing so that he didn't have to serve people for long periods of time. He kept pretending he misunderstood things, so that he won't serve the food, so my guests waited over 1 hour between the first two courses. He said the number of guests I had would fit comfortably there. We could not move, that's how crammed the tables were. It was a p"
"Absolutely delicious food, some of the best I have yet found in Lincoln Park. I would readily recommend anyone to go and check them out, the service is wonderful and they provide you with lots of little free extras during the meal!"
"I really adore the enviornment-- high backed chairs that make you feel royal, and super dark lighting where you have to hunch over a candle. The drinks are amazing. The seating somehow feels really private and intimate, especially if you love the dark. But definitely go on a weeknight-- because swarms of people will spoil the serenity."
I dont know what to say but if i had to eat i would die eating in here...I love this place
"The atmosphere is fun, the ambiance just puts you in a good mood. The service was excellent, helpful but not pushy. I went early on in the night so it wasn't over crowded. THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! All the samplers and the entrees were unstoppable. This place is a must go if you like Latin food. Their food was fresh, the service was right on point, and the vibe of the restaurant starts your night off the right way. Nothing bad to say."
"Very authentic Korean grill style cuisine. I really enjoyed the 20 different complimentary appetizers that came with the meal. There was a great variety of pickled vegetables and seared tofus. We ordered 3 varieties of meats and they were served with a side of lettuce and sauces to wrap them in. VERY DELICIOUS!!The atmosphere could have been better ventilated, It was very smoky and when we left we all smelled like grilled meat. The staff were not so personable but provided good service."
"Good noodle, many choices. but sometime wait too long.I like the place."
"My buddy and I stopped in for a couple beers last night. ��A couple had just gotten up from the bar and we sat down when another guy came over and told us that these were his seats. ��We said ""no, we're sitting here."" ��He states that the bartender was reserving them. ��She came oer and said ""oh, sorry, I was holding those seats for them."" ��What kind of service is this when even the door hostess told us that it was open seating when we came in and she was even bringing us MENUS to these seats as all this transpired! ��Shame on the bartender. ��We turned to the bartender and said that they can have their seats and we would be going somewhere else. ��The worst part was as we were leaving I turned around as we were walking out, the one guy is shouting obscenities, and the female bartender that I the"
"This was the perfect place for Sunday brunch. Everything was delicious. I had this chorizo omelet, and some pumpkin pancakes for dessert. I WILL return!"
"love it fun wine from southern Italy, the lamb was great.need to move a bit closer to this place ..."
"Just had breakfast at Big Jones for the first time this past Saturday and it was GREAT! I had some of the best Eggs Benedict I've EVER had. The ham was very tasty & they serve it on popovers rather than English muffins...a very nice twist! The hollandaise sauce was PERFECT! Rounded out with freshly squeezed orange juice (very tasty), complimentary beignets (again, very tasty), a warm and cozy atmosphere (both in furnishings AND temperature) and it was a great experience. I've eaten here probably 7 or 8 times since they opened their doors and have NEVER been disappointed. I only wish they would bring back their Mississippi Mud Pie/Cake. BEST dessert on the menu! *hint, hint* Will definitely be back and have taken friends as well as recommended to friends. Keep up the good work!"
I'm a fan of this place! Great brunch place(:
"I LOVE this place! Dinner is pricey (I believe it is still $50 per person for the full experience and $24.50 for just the salad bar), but if you can make it here for lunch, the price is $32.50 for the meat/salad combo. As a group, we had a terrific time. The meat is delicious and the salad bar is exceptional. ��A great place to go for a birthday or celebratory event. ��TIP: I would strongly suggest eating here on a completely empty stomach. ��The dough-butter bread that is heavenly will fill you up, so consume with caution. Additionally, we went on a Thursday and made a reservation for 8PM. We were not seated until 9:30, it may have just been a busy night, but nevertheless, make a reservation!To name a few of the meats: They have a succulent Picanha, Filet Mignon, Linguica, and Lombo. There a"
"I've stopped in for dessert. I defiantly recommend the desserts. They beer is pretty standard price, not many good specials ran on alcohol. The inside is super cute and looks like they spent a fortune on the remodel. Ill have to eat there sometime for dinner. the waitstaff is nice as well."
"Little Bucharest has a great atmosphere, great service, and great food! When I was there tonight the waitress and manager were extremely friendly and helpful. There was a wandering accordion player that really added a nice touch to the place. My table shared some delicious salads (the beets were amazing!) and the sausage-stuffed chicken was fantastic. Overall a great experience - I would definitely go back!"
Outstanding! In town on business for a couple weeks and heard that Rick Bayless had a new restaurant. I went on a Monday only to discover they were closed. Went back on Tuesday and wow I'm glad I did!Ordered the special which was Carnitas with a guacamole sauce and some other heavenly ingredients. It was worth coming back for.Grabbed several Churros on my way out. I'm just sorry I didn't try the hot chocolate. Good reason to go back I think!
"Had a great time. We had four people in our party and there was something for everyone. Our wine drinking friend loved the affordable list. Our meat eaters were satisfied with the meatballs, bone marrow and roast chicken. My wife loved how the music is in the background and we could have a conversation without ��shouting. If you like good food at affordable prices, you must try this place."
Pequods Pizza is the best pizza in the universe hands down. I think I've eaten pizza at every place in Chicago and no one holds a candle to this place. They do this thing where they caramelize their crust and OMG its so good. They are a bit on the pricey side but with most things in life you get what you pay for. I brought my inlaws here when they were visiting from out of town and they agreed. Best pizza ever!!
"I went for a business lunch today at the restaurant. ��I give the place 5 stars for decor and ambiance, what I enjoyed was the several photos of topless women which I thought was very tasteful. ��In the interest of an orderly meeting we were offered a set menu. ��The presentation was beautiful but the taste was par not sensational. ��This restaurant loses a star because many people wanted to go boxes but they refused to give any which I thought was just ridiculous. ��I'm willing to give this place another chance and choose something off the menu at which point I may give them a higher rating."
"The Gage is my favorite place in the city, I really love the concept, the food is fantastic and the service has always been great. ��Been 4 times and ��i have never had a complaint. ��The fondue is amazing and the burger is cheap if you don't want to spend alot."
"But he has nothing on!The Emperor has no clothes, folks. My crap review is going to do nothing to dilute the totals for Mr. Doug Sohn. He is clearly a true mensch, and deserves the Encased Meats Medal of Honor if there were one. He works his butt off and for that I respect him. But there are a few things worth noting:Love for HD is 50% tourists. He's listed in all the guides so tourists make the pilgrimage. This means dauntingly long lines. ?Hours plus. Just to get a freaking hot dog. Any other decent business owner would just hire more people. Increase capacity. ?We're not talking about product that cannot be made in higher numbers, or more quickly, by moving to a lager location or hiring additional staff. ?These sausages are NOT made by Doug or his staff. They are merely grilled or boile"
"Great Persian food, and since i'm Persian i know the true taste of Iranian food. Price a bit high though."
We went here for their Yelp fixed menu. It was easily the best food I have ever had for 24 dollars. We ha three course and all three were incredible. Service was top notch. Friendly manager.I love this place and I will be back!
What can I say? ��I loved the food and I loved the drink. ��Service was great! ��I went there with a firend and she loved it too. ��Ill be back for sure
"Wow, what a disappointment.My wife and I went for our anniversary. ��We are used to fine dining, having eaten at Daniel and Per Se in NYC, The Fat Duck in Bray, and Noma in Copenhagen, amongst other greats.We were expecting a lot from Alinea, being recommended to us as one of (if not THE) best restaurant in North America. ��For those lofty expectations, we were crest fallen when they were not met.Perhaps it's our own fault for being overly hyped but the customer is never wrong, as they say. ��If only every fine dining establishment followed that credo.My wife and I are young and even younger looking and we suffer for that at these type of establishments. ��Ageism is prevalent among the servers in fine dining, especially in America. ��How dare people of our age come to a restaurant of such pomp "
"Had an absolutely amazing night out here. Watched a poetry slam, drank too much, listened to jazz. Place is intimate and friendly, and feels super authentic. Everyone seems passionate and the drinks are well-made.Really awesome place."
"I really love this restaurant, been here a couple of times and they never disappoint. ��They are clearly popular because every time I come here we have to wait awhile to be seated (even with reservations), but it is always worth the wait. ��Service is good, food is excellent, and you can't beat the ambience of this restaurant gem."
"This was great! The tasting menu is the way to go. Comparing it to my gold standard, Alinea, it would get 4.5 stars. The presentation was fun-one dish had dry ice giving an artistic effect. The cheese course was amazing!!! The extra effort for our anniversary was appreciated. They brought us menus with our names and date on it as well as a Happy Anniversary in chocolate and a little cake."
"i have to say we were ti 50 several times and i do enjoy coming there, the drins are nice, the food is avarage, the service is good i have to say.the reason for 3 stars is the chicken wings - they pride to be the best chicken wings in the city - ill tell you they may be right if you like them bredded and oily and no taste.me and my wife each had 1 and decided to through away the rest. other then that avarage nice bar to go to - just dont order the wings."
"I loveeee this place. Sometimes I come here and see a line not around the building, but around the block. The hot dogs are cheap and in the quintessential chicago style. Chicago's best hot dogs!!!"
"Perfection.I tell you, one of the major perks of living in Lakeview (besides the clean atmosphere, pedestrian friendly streets, beautiful architecture on the buildings, and the...lake) is the plethora of great eateries we have within walking distance.Crisp definitely fits in here. ��Their sweet and slightly spicy wings (which are uncut, full winged monsters) are definitely worth trying. They are what got me hooked ��on this place.My favorites are the Buddha bowls: ��delightful combinations of spinach, rice, beansprouts, carrots, and other vegetables. ��Meat if you want it. ��Oh... and I mustn't forget about the lovely fried egg they put on top!!! ��The regular-sized bowls are large enough for two people to share!It's hearty enough for vegetarians!The atmosphere of the place is nice, too. ��The fe"
"Atmosphere: ?Grade DFood: ?Grade B--------------------------------Average: ?Grade C ? ?or ?A-OKI took my daughter for lunch for her birthday and this is where she wanted to go. ?We arrived around 1:30 p.m. on a Wednesday and there was a short line. We were told to stand in line and we started to study the chalkboard menu, which was so full of items it was difficult to read. ?Then, we noticed the hostess, who had greeted us, handing out menus to other people in line. ?Gee, thanks. ?I politely asked for a menu and we had literally 30 seconds to decide what to order, since we were up to the counter. ?I asked what would be recommended and counter girl gave me a point towards the menu board. ?We both ordered tortas-I had the jamon (ham) torta and my daughter had a Cubana pork torta, which basic"
"Working nearby this restaurant, we order frequently from here. The lunch special is such a good deal and includes a lot of food. ��Delivery is very prompt, and we usually put in a large order and it is correct. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. I always get the Pad Thai and it is always satisfying and delicious. ��I enjoy giving them business."
"I was disappointed with the Superdawg, maybe because the expectation was high based on the review of others. ��The meal in a box was novel, but the bun was mushy and the fries soggy."
"This is hands down, the best mock-meat restaurant Ive ever been to. ��Most other places ive been to give you large chunks of prepared seitan or processed tofu. Here they create meals and do an amazing job of it! ��Ive been here well over a dozen times and have never been disappointed. So far, the meatloaf and the Ruben sandwich were my favorite dishes. The margaritas were just right (not too strong, not too weak and with a great taste). I also had a milkshake that had all of my favorites in it (cookie dough, peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream)The service is just as good as the food and everyone is really friendly and knowledgeable. The big downside is that the place is small and i hesitate bringing large groups because it would take quite a while to get that many seats together."
"Great place for a special dinner. Seafood was excellent, but expensive. ��However, you get what you pay for. ��Would definitely go back."
go with the chilaquiles and the fresh coffee outside!
"This place has over 1200 reviews?! Wow, talk about word of mouth advertising. But it's amazing, I agree. Well worth the wait in line. Haven't had a sausage I didn't like here."
"Last night was my second visit to Davanti Enoteca, and I have yet to be disappointed. Since the wait for a table was up to 45 minutes, my hubby and I decided to cozy up to the bar and order a bottle of wine and our meal. The bartender recommended the Wednesday night martini special, made up a small glass and let us taste it. Not my kind of drink (strawberry, basil, balsamic vinegar something - a liquefied salad in your mouth). We ended up ordering an Argentinian bottle of red. We ordered the mascarpone polenta with pork shoulder ragu (the ragu of the day), 3 cheese plate (Robiolina fior de Bosco (my favorite), Grana Padano, and Montasio Vino Rosso), and a pizza D.O.C. Everything was VERY good and just the right amount of food for two. I recommend Davanti for a romantic meal for two or brin"
"Best Thai in Chicago!They deliver on quality every single time. ��I have never had a bad experience here and every time I bring a new person, they rant and rave how wonderful it is too. ��Friends from out of town always tell me how they crave it and wish they had it near them.The decor is fun, though it can get a bit loud in there when its busy. ��The wait staff could be a bit more friendly but the service is quick and your never left waiting too long. ��The only ""negative"" thing I have to say is that I wish the portions were larger cause I always want more. ��Its that good!"
"Nice atmosphere. The decor is nice. Bathrooms are only downstairs, which was kind of weird. Food was good with lots of choices. Mango daiquiris are good."
This was my second trip to Sapoi Trattoria and it was just as good as the first time! The first time we went was for a Bachlorette party dinner. They personalized the menu with a special message to the bride! I took my parents this time and we were all very impressed with the service and the meal! Everyone should try this neighborhood Italian restaurant! You won't regret it!
"Anteprima is a great (relatively) new addition to the Chicago Italian restaurant portfolio. ��We dined at Anteprima for the third time (in two years) this past Saturday. ��I am fairly picky as far as Italian cuisine goes, having been raised Italian-American and spoiled by great family chefs. ��So you'll be hard pressed to get five stars out of me for an Italian joint. ��Anteprima is pretty darn close though. ��All three meals were great. �� Two out of three times I had pasta dishes as an entree, as did my wife. ��All were pretty spectacular. ��Portions are middle of the road (to very slightly below average) in terms of what you can expect in Chicago. ��If you like spicy, try the orrecchiete or buccatini. ��Both were rock solid. ��On my most recent visit I was craving some meat - ordered a flank steak"
Great food and serve the best burgers ever. Lovely staff and comfy feel to the place.
Swanky good time. ��Unbuckle your belt and get ready for some good eating. Warning: ��Eating Brazzaz often may lead to some or all of the following:1) Heart disease2) Fat arse3) Big hips4) Limp weewee5) Elevated bp6) Vegetarianism (which has a comorbidity with #4)
"Big fan of pho, and this place has the best in the area. We have tried EVERY one of them. Place is always packed and their menu is so large it is almost overhwleming. I get the pho everytime, my wife has mixed it up and has liked what she got everytime. Service is very very average but Im not sure thats exactly what they are looking for. Def more of a turn and burn kind of place. Not a lace to take a date unless its for lunch but fantastic Vietnamese for sure."
Service is prompt
"Large portion sizes priced reasonably low! ��Our server made wonderful recommendations from the drinks to the entrees. ��I had the Cafe con Leche - best cup of coffee ever! ��My friend had the Mango Tea. We shared the avocado salad that was dressed in a lime vinaigrette. ��this alone was the perfect meal. ��simple. refreshing and satisfying. ��We also had a skewered shrimp special that was perfect. ��The atmosphere was causal, fun and comfortable. ��This is a must-go-to place that you'll probably visit more than once!"
"We were disappointed. I was going to go to Laguardia Cuban rest a half mile east on armitage but decided to try 90 mile. The parking is awkward as the side street is zoned on one side and no parking the other side. Then we walked passed a smelly grease container by the kitchen rear entrance. We came in and sat in a hot room that reminded me of a brown tent. We got the menus when we were seated. It took a few minutes to get the water. We ordered a bowl of black bean soup, some fried bananas and a pork sandwich on whole wheat roll. The soup was salty, the bananas greasy. The sandwich had about one teaspoon of pork on the whole thing and the bread didn't look like whole wheat. The fried yuca fries were cold but the garlic sauce was ok. . The waiter acted indifferent to our needs. The bill was"
"It is A-Ok in my books. ?This place is nice and refreshing for Bridgeport. ?It is a tad bit expensive though. ?So most likely it will not be my go to breakfast/brunch place on a regular basis. ?However, I will definitely keep them in mind. ?The stuffed french toast was very good. ?Service was a bit on the slow side. ?I had to request coffee repeatedly before getting a refill. ?The people were very nice, but I guess just real busy. ?Nana the owner was very nice and warm as well. ?If you haven't been, and happen to be in the neighborhood you should check them out."
"I loved this place. ��Went here for valentines day, and fell in love with the lights and decor. ��The staff was friendly and made great recommendations. �� I had the truffle pasta, which was simple and delicious. ��Will have to come back to try more of the menu!"
"Hands down my favorite restaurant!We ate there for our 2nd anniversary and the menu allowed us to be so creative. ��mushroom risotto, polenta with spicy rapini, sweet potato relish. two quartinos of wine (no mark up for smaller size). Two veggie pasta entrees including goat cheese ravioli with olive butter, sage and orange zest - sublime - and a ridiculous chocolate tart to top it all off.we were happily sated, and happy to pay $50 a person.Not many options for the vegetarian though."
"Being a self-proclaimed breakfast connoisseur, I couldn't have been more pleased with Yolk. I had read so many great things about this place but had never been in the area at the right time to enjoy it. I spent my Memorial Day in the area and was able to start my day off here. My boyfriend and I stopped in and waited a little less than an hour but boy, was it worth it! I had the Stuffed French Toast and my boyfriend chose the traditional Eggs Benedict..both were absolutely delicious. While the wait was a little long, they really move people in and out quite quickly and it is an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend Yolk!"
"Have been hearing about this place for years and finally tried it. I have to admit the caramelized crust is delicious and unique...I hadn't had that before in a deep dish. But everything else about the pizza was not so great. FAR too doughy/bready. Unremarkable tomato sauce. Toppings were fine. Admittedly, I'll be back just for the caramelized crust. If I could buy just the crust, I would!"
"My wife and I had to try this Chicago culinary experience at least once. ��We had read up and knew of the long wait ahead of us. ��We should have suspected reasons to worry when the entire line (90 minute wait for us) consisted of no one over the age of 30. ��The establishment is doing well. ��They have a very tiny seating area with about 5 tables that can seat 4 - 6 people, about 5 2-seater tables, and a small bar seating area that can sit about 10. ��It doesn't matter if you're staying or getting things to go, you're waiting in the line the same as everyone else. ��The food is good, but it is just good. ��The hot dogs are nothing extraordinary, so sticking with the different sausages is recommended. ��However, for the extreme wait outside with no bar service or anything else to keep you occupied"
"This is my favorite take out Thai food. ��Complex flavors and great range of dishes. ��Worth the (sometimes) hour and a half it takes to get to my door. ��I would give them 5 starts, but the rice is just no good at all. ��Always over cooked and gummy. ��I throw down the extra $$ for fried rice if I am in a ricey mood."
"OK so when my friend invited me to this restaurant and I heard where it was located, I almost said no way! ( the neighborhood is not the best a little shady if you ask me) however from my passed experiences I knew that some times you can find a diamond in the rough. I decided to give it a try, from the outside it appeared like a hole in the wall. after walking through the small hallway ( entrance), the decor was nice and modern the chairs looked comfortable and if I were a designer I would have wanted these for my loft. I looked through the menu, first at their prices then at the food. I am not one to care for menus that contain pictures, to me this does not look classy and makes the place look cheap; i must admit however that if you never had sushi or are not familiar with the terms a pic"
"The servers are incredibly knowlegable, attentive, & polite. The food is ��fresh & delicious. I love that it's BYOB so you can spend a little extra money on the food & keep your bill under control."
"This is one of the better sushi places I like to go to, especially when happy hour starts which is I believe 4 days out of the week! ��You get half off *most* of the sushi menu. ��Sushi X' choices overall are superb and each of the rolls they make are good, unlike some places where one is better than the other. ��The place itself has a nice ambiance and is much smaller than their sibling restaurant on Diversey. ��Sushi X is a place for good sushi across the board, bonus for happy hour and pluses for good delivery time."
Definitely the best Italian food I've had. ��It all kind of tasted the same too. ��Not what I expected.
"I just wanted to write that the Crab Rangoon Roll is to die for. Go eat one now. Looks like a strip club on the outside, to me at least, but lets be cliche and not judge a book by its cover. Yummy!"
"I love this place! It's small and gets busy, but the food is amazing! I would have a light snack before going! Unless it's a weekday!"
"My wife and I are from Toronto and came to Chicago for a long weekend. We made our reservations about 8 weeks in advance and had a choice of 5:15 or 9:15. We took the earlier sitting. The room is beautiful, the service was close to perfect and the food was unforgettable. The stand out dishes were the Yuba - (shrimp, miso, togarashi) , Razor Clam - (carrot, soy, daikon), Rabbit rillette, the short rib and the dessert, created on your table ( they put a silicon tablecloth over your table and spread the ingredients across the surface) We selected the vintage wine pairing and I felt pretty good about that decision. ��Table 52 first night and Alinea on the second was certainly one extreme to the other. If you consider yourself a foodie, Alinea should be on your list of places to go. One caution:"
Deep dish is definitely what this group does well. ��Thin Crust is so-so. ��Would re-visit.
"Fantastic food, low prices, prompt service, super cheap takeout, new decor.The new place opened in October 2009, and it's now brighter, quieter, more fashionable and much bigger than before. If you want food that's incredibly tasty and so cheap you'll be sure someone made a mistake, get the takeout from the counter near the door. A seafood combo with rice (mention ""with rice"") is just $6.10 for a mountain of top-quality food. The barbecue combo with rice (again mention ""with rice"") is a bit less and gives you pork, chicken and duck. If you choose to eat inside, it's a bit less cheap, but still great value. The guys at the takeout counter speak English but not a lot. If you forget to say ""with rice"" they might give you a double order of meat for double the price, so be sure to use those mag"
Love Love Love this place GREAT FOOD & GREAT SERVICE my fav!!!!
"First time visiting and we were being treated to dinner before seeing a play. ��Loved the ambiance of the place! ��Asked our server for what I wanted in a wine, and she brought out something right on key! ��The Chilean Sea Bass - divine! ��I don't eat sushi, but tried the Caterpiller and it was exquisite! ��I ordered the Thai fried chicken and though it was good, I was disappointed. ��I ordered because I love the take of coconut in my food - I barely tasted the coconut. ��Everything else was wonderful - I will be visiting again!"
I often have visited sultans but never taken advantage of there delivery service and i will never do it again. I ordered 2 sandwiches and a small rice. I waited about 45 minutes was excited for my delicious food then the delivery driver hits me up with a 34 dollar bill. I have often ordered this at the restaurant and it was only at most 15 dollars slap on a 3 dollar delivery fee and you got about 20 dollars. I ask him are you sure and he says thats the total and i was forced to pay it. Thats the most I'm ever paying for a Falafel ever in my life say no to this delivery service if you can. Not worth 34 dollars at all
great seafood. I waited a long time for the food. The decor needs some work. I got a nice letter from the owner. i appreciate him taking the time.
"I thought I had lost a dream sushi restaurant when Shushido closed and then found out that Coast had opened with the same chefs! I highly recommend this sushi restaurant. Prompt service, excellent quality fish and desserts are nothing to sneeze at! I highly suggest the spider roll, the rainbow roll , the dragon and my favorite of all THE VOLCANO! My partner had the shashmi platter which was filled with delicious cuts of fish, while I had the teriayki chicken. I was quite full but could have easily been forced to eat more! The desserts were quite chi chi but very delicious."
Amazing chicken shawarma!!! Used a LiveCheapr Coupon and go there all the time now
"This place is worth the hype. i only waited about 35 minutes for a table which, i expecting to wait longer. I loved everything about the place including the wallpaper in the bathroom.The wait staff was super friendly and personable. The kobe meatballs & wild boar sloppy Joe were excellent..I will def be back."
"If you're looking for a breakfast place where you'll be waiting outside for more than a half hour, and when you will be finally seated you'll be rushed by the busboy to finish your meal by constantly asking you if they can take your dishes away, even though the food is still on your plate and if you're unfortunate to be seated in a middle raw table be ready to have your chair constantly bumped into by the constant moving of waitresses, busboy, managers and people who are seated. ��If this doesn't stop you, go ahead and enjoy a not so great meal for a high price where they charge extra if you want some more maple syrup for your pancake. ��Dan"
"I absolutely love Coast...as does everyone else I know. ?I think its hilarious how its everybody's secret favorite spot....except everyone know about it. ?Unless you go early, it's best to call for a reservation...love the byob. ?The true secret roll is the ultraman. ?It was a special once several months ago and no longer on the menu, but they make it for you if you ask. ?I'm telling you, try this roll - especially if you love mushrooms, you won't be disappointed. ?Everyone I take here loves it as much as I do - even my boyfriend who hates sushi ended up liking it. ?Price is great for good Chicago sushi. ?Definitely a must."
"I would give this restaurant 0 stars. While I have been a patron for several years, this restaurant has changed and I would NOT recommend it to anyone - no matter the price of the meal. ��The owner and manager are very rude and cursed me out in person and on the phone when I tried to discuss the unacceptable experience we had dining at Caro Mio. ��The service was horrendous, the food was not edible, the dishes and silverware were filthy - need I say more. ��Furthermore, the server brought us the wrong food - not one of the dishes we ordered was delivered to us, but rather we were given food that was not identifiable and not edible. ��I guess they had to clean out the old food in the kitchen and serve it to what they thought were unsuspecting customers. ��When the manager stopped by to see how w"

"Okay, this place has so many five star reviews it doesn't really need mine, but I can't resist. �� ��I have been to Schwa three times now, and although there has been a little repetition in the menu, I have never minded because their dishes are nearly all out-of-this-world. �� I highly recommend the nine course option -- yes, it's $110 per person for the food -- but you can bring your own wine, and there's no better spot in the city to splurge on a special occasion with your significant other or a small group of good friends. �� Unlike other high-end Chicago spots where the outsized staff hovers over you to the point of annoyance, Schwa is relaxed and fun, and you are actually served by the chefs themselves. ��And yes, the food is better (in my opinion) than Alinea, Tru and the rest. �� Enjoy th"
"OMG, it was great. Staff knows their place, they can anwser every ? posssible, and I ask a lot of ???? A little pricy, but for the amount of food we got there it was totally worth it. Besides I wasn't paying, but we got more then we hoped we would get. Tons of food, awesome drinks. Enjoy it!"
"BUYER BEWARE - I have been giving Bongo Room my Sunday brunches since they opened. ��Food is good, but with every passing year they make it more and more difficult to continue considering them. ��The customer experience is the absolute last thing on their agenda in there, if its on there at all (sometimes I think not). ��They have a good product and rest their laurels on it. ��Took the week off from work in tough, stressful economy to spend time with wife and two infant children. ��Began our much anticipated week together on Monday AM @ Bongo Room. ��The glass front door had a crack in it and had to be replaced (there is another glass door after that door, so this crack was NOT contributing to coldness in the restaurant). ��While the owner of Bongo Room looked on, they hired a repairman to come a"
"One of the gauchos that served my table was extremely accommodating as to how I liked the meat cooked. ��He came back to our table before the kitchen closed just to check if we had wanted anything else after already eating so much.This was a great experience. ��I just wish that they had more 50% off specials. ��The last time that had this special was two years ago, I believe."
"Bummer Trip - I've been to Pho Xe Tang probably 10 times since I moved to Chicago 10 years ago. Tonight though was a bad experience to say the least. It started out great because my companion was very knowledgeable about asian food and I was learning new ways to enjoy it.Then my friend removed something from his Pho bowl and put it in a napkin and waved the waiter over. It was a cockroach.The waiter took the roach and the bowl away and said he would get a fresh bowl for my friend. My friend had lost his appetite and refused another. The waiter returned to say that we would not have to pay for that bowl of pho. No real effort was made to express concern or an apology.I could not finish my own bowl of pho, or even the spring roll that had been so delicious a few minutes earlier.We asked for "
Simply the best. My mouth waters just thinking about a SuperDawg and fries. ?Oh to be back in Chicago. Best Kosher dog you can buy. The previous review by Rita J is not correct as SUPERDAWG is NOT a Chicago Vienna and never has been. Oh and don't ask for ketchup on your SuperDawg as you will not get any and the correct way to order is to ask for a SuperDawg not a hot dog or a red hot. The counter person will be the first to inform you that they only serve SuperDawgs. Enjoy!
"Shaw's Sunday brunch is a little pricey, but when you see what you get for the money, it's the best deal in town. ��Food is all delicious and fresh, fresh, fresh. ��Raw oysters, crab knuckles smoked salmon, sushi and salads are some of the great cold items. ��I didn't make it to the hot items because the cold ones were so wonderful. ��But they have make your own omelets, french toast, waffles, pasta, seafood, bacon and more, more, more. ��The dessert room (yes, an entire room) has great items, all but one are homemade, and gummy worms and M&Ms for kids too! ��Really a wonderful experience. ��There is also a $5 Bloody Mary and mimosa bar. GREAT condiments. ��You have to get there and enjoy this fabulous Chicago treat."
"nice red interior, good service, i loved the bread and the mushroom risotto!! they have nice salad bar. cheese was great but, oyester wasn't that fresh. ��we've waited for the filet for such a long time, so i had to ask server several times for the specific meat that i wanted to eat.. other than that, i think it's a good deal to go btw mon.~ thur. cus it's only $34.99 a person."
"The food is great here! ��Delicious! ��I've gone several times and being Korean I was somewhat skeptical about the You So Crazy Korean Burrito but I have to say that the Seoul Sensation is exactly that...sensational! ��The chicken of course, especially the Wacky Wacky Wings, are awesome too. ��The BBQ and the Seoul Sassy sauces are my favorite. ��I've told many friends to try it and they have all liked it as well. �� The owners were very friendly and helpful explaining the menus and they seem very invested in making sure that you will enjoy your meal there. ��Definitely will be returning to try out some of their other menu items. You have to go!"
"Great staff, decent food, excellent juice."
"I love a good steakhouse. ��Although this one is a chain restaurant, it is done well and it is done right. ��I like the atmosphere, the decor, and I have to admit that the food is spectacular. ��I also like the fact that it is reasonably priced, you won't leave broke or hungry, and there are absolutely no airs. ��It's set up like an old fashioned supper club, and you can dress up or down.We have been to Wildfire quite a few times....admittedly we once went twice in a week. ��They have great wine tasting dinners. ��Hands down, I would recommend one to anyone who is interested in learning the art of wine pairings. ��It is really great fun. ��Our first time, my boyfriend I felt like were were on a couples blind date. ��You are paired with 2 or 3 other couples at your table, and the wine and courses ar"
"What a gem. ��The staff is super friendly, the food is great, and the atmosphere is really quite something. ��I have never ordered anything on the menu that I didn't like. ��A great place for family, dates, and meeting up with friends. ��Yum."
"Went in there for some Romanian food. Btw, the flaming cheese is not Romanian. The waitress was brand new, totally lost in space, extremely slow, and forgot to bring the silverware. The food was OK, but the cook must have been in love, since everything was super salty. Bring your Lasix , if you are hypertensive. The owner doesn't know his dishes, and I would recommend a trip to Romania to refresh his memory. He wasn't entertaining at all, quite the contrary, I should say, with some poor taste jokes. Since he could tell we were not happy, tried to bribe us with some free wine. ��Too little, too late. The bill was outrageous. Never again.The food tasted like home, minus the salt, therefore the 2 stars, instead of one."
"This was good food but I felt a little let down. ��After weeks of planning to go here, I was a little disappointed at the food. ��The BLT was great!, but every thing else we had was just ok-Pork Shoulder, Salami/ Meat slices, Bone Marrow, and a decent Turkey Leg. ��I would recommend it to someone to try for themselves, but still a little disappointed."
"Food is great--seats very uncomfortable--wooden chairs.Bartenders not friendly and the blonde was a witch with a B. ��Restaurant is filled with 20-something hipsters. ��Very loud. ��The drinks were average. ��Beautiful location room overloking Michigan Ave. and Grant Park. ��Service abysmal. ��If they can fix that, they'll do ok."
"I wanted to try Fondue for years now... so when groupon put on a deal for Geja's, I quickly bought it. Before booking my reservation, spent hours looking at the menu and reading the other reviews ...just so I can understand how everything works.The place is romantic, really cool spot, guitar playing....perfect atmosphere! You can read all other reviews for more details!Our server Leah was really cool and helpful!Me and my date we ordered the Seafood platter and the cheese and chocolate fondue...+ a bottle of wine.We received 2 small salads with just greens and Italian dressing (seems like the greens were sitting outside for a long time)Next we received the cheese fondue; the melted cheese was really tasty! With it we got a basket of apples, grapes, and small pieces of bread to dip into the"
"My husband took me there for my 30th birthday and it was amazing! Beautiful decor, many people in the restaurant but still the environment is very pleasant and quiet. We had the best beef fillet, ever! Very friendly service, nice art. Just wonderful. Highly recommended!"
Love everything about this place the food the ambiance! ��Always a great meal and an even better dessert. ��The service is great the the banana wanton a must after diner. My husband and I love to go here for a romantic night out alone or with friends it is a very intimate place to visit.
"I love this place for Greek Food! ��I cant spell it but their pastechio is AWESOME!! ��And the bread is great--I am a big sesame fan!! ��Again, being a diabetic, and a BIG Diet coke drinker, I was disapointed that they serve these little bottles and not a good fountain drink!! ��Dont get me wrong, not many companies offer BOTH Diet coke and PEPSI! ��Which almost makes up for it!!?? ��BUT GREEK ISLANDS ISNT THE MARKUP ON SODA ALREADY HUGE!!!!???? ��Come on now!"
"So I went to this place to have churros and a chocolate drink. You'd think these two simple things would be amazing here, right? I mean, with the Bayless and all. Guess what... they're not. I'd rather go to Starbucks and then the churro stand at the Navy Pier, as the food at those places is better, cheaper, and quicker to get despite having to get from one establishment to the next. Bayless is overrated."
Great wings only second to Wings Around the World..these are phenominal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Either or for me..but if im going south im going to Wings around the World...BEST EVER...recognize..crisp you got youre own thing going as well..keep up the good chicken...
"This weeks date night with the hubby was at Glenn's Diner. We were first timers and hear some awesome things about their all you can eat crab legs. If this review was based on food alone I would have given it 5 stars, the crab legs were huge and its no joke ALL YOU CAN EAT! The menu was extensive and I would love to go back and try more. I learned that you need to make a reservation because it is a teeny tiny place. Maybe 10- 12 tables and it was crowded (this I always consider a good thing), but very very squished. The service was good- nothing stellar just good service, meaning we had our drinks on time, we received our refills on our basket of crabs and were well attended to. The vibe of this place is nothing fancy by all means, it was a fun hip little diner with a fun atmosphere, a gre"
"You can smell the garlic in the air a block away from this place - in a good way. ��My husband swears by the chicken parm with homemade rigatoni, but I've had many of their dishes.Their lobster ravioli with marsacpone alfredo sauce is out of this world, and their asiago stuffed gnocchi is so delicious!The homemade tiramisu is incredible, too. ��But, it's really hard to have dessert after you've stuffed yourself with the entree.This restaurant is very romantic and cozy - especially on a cold winter night. ��It's very non-descript from the street - they have huge plants blocking most of the windows. ��It's the kind of indulgent place that makes it worth gaining a few pounds."
"if you haven't been to the lock-down bar & grill then you need your a$$ beat!!! haha seriously this place has the best biggest juicy angus beef burgers that my stomach has ever came across.my fiance and i came here after our cubs game yesterday and ive been telling here we must go here, and i wanna try the fat elvis!!!so we get there the door guy was super chill and cool, very friendly atmosphere, and our waiter chiara was super cool as well, i asked about additional burgers selections and she always had great reviews on them, but of course her fave was the fat elvis, so i knew i had to try it!we sat outside and man the weather was great although it was cloudy the breeze felt amazing! so i get my burger and it was huge the peanut butter and bananas was jus oozing off the bun, i was overwhe"
"In short, the food is awful. The service was very friendly and accommodating, but the food is down right terrible. We had high hopes and ordered the calamari salad (tasted OLD and fishy), the bruschetta (very salty and not at all fresh tasting), the polenta (again not fresh and salty) and finally the zuppo di pesce...again, just bad. I ate about one bite of the main course and was done. We didn't finish anything because it was that terrible and we were starving!!! This place is one of the closest restaurants to our condo. We really wanted to like it, but no luck. Our first visit was about a year and a half ago and it didn't go well. We read the Yelp reviews last night and were shocked to see how highly it was rated. Thinking it was a fluke that our first visit was a bust, we gave it anothe"
"Great place, incredible food!"
"These may be the best wings I've ever eaten in my life. ��My wife and I stopped in after seeing BMG and we ordered 10 wings and a steak bowl. ��It was more than we could eat! ��The wings are so big that the drumette portion is bigger than some actual drumsticks I've seen. ��I'd be afraid to meet that chicken in a dark alley...We had half sassy Seoul and half BBQ and both were delicious. ��The steak bowl has excellently seasoned bulgogi-style beef and perfect rice. ��I think a five-piece wing or a bowl would be plenty for one person (either one is around eight bucks).It is a unique ambience - big slab tables and a couple of counters with bar stools. ��If you can get the window seat, though, it's great for people watching while you eat. ��This place is so good that we'll make a special trip downtown"
"sultans is always yummy and in the summer there is a nice little patio. ��yeah, ofcoarse the pan fried options, like falafel are the best! but, the salad bar stands on its own as a healthier option. ��they also deliver, which is cool. ��the only complaint i have is for some reason they got rid of their orangina, and for that reason alone i had to dock a star. ��there is something so right about the orangina and falafel combination."
the platter is definately ridiculousbut the bbq isnt anything special... its just average... best bbg galbi in town are solga and woo chon.
"I Love love the bar with the Ladies!!! I like the range of food choices, from pizza to ribs! The food is Great whether you order in or delivery! The service nor the food has never let me down in the 5 years I have eaten there! ;-D"
"One of the best brunch places in the MIDWEST, not just Chicago. Awesome, creative food. Very good. expect a long line/wait on weekends. I wish they were open at Night. Very very good place."
"Love this place. ��We will be back soon. ��Service wasn't the best, but could have just been our server and the food was awesome! ��Love the lively, colorful, romantic design. ��Love the celebrity photos."
"Great atmosphere,very helpful waitress. I was shocked at how well priced everything was. A very complete menu to satisfy any desire. I was with a group of 4 and everyone ordered something different and everything was well prepared and delicious. I would definitely recommend it to anyone for any occasion."
"I'm not going to belabor what others have said in terms of the positives of this place, but I'd like to address the negatives.1. ?Pretentious - I understand how some people would find this place to be pretentiousm, but grow up already. ?The rules in the bathroom include no bud light, ha! ?To be honest, I find it refreshing that a bar attempts to attract a different sort of clientele. ?The Violet Hour is all about finely crafted cocktails, so why would you order a beer here after waiting in line for an hour? ?I think its nice that they don't allow talking on cell phones, in this day in age, it is refreshing to be someplace quiet to catch up with friends without having to listen to some obnoxious jabberwok blabbing away on their cell phone. ?If pretentiosness means having manners, then call "
"I have been eating at La Villa since I was a child, I grew up on their thin crust and deep dish pizza. I truly wished I still lived on the Northwest side of chicago. I would do anything just for a slice of La Villa's Pizza. One of the best in the city in my opinion."
"My husband and i dined at graham elliot the other night and had such a great time. I must admit I was a bit wary when I read some of the recent reviews, but I was excited nonetheless because of all the press. We were seated by window at a bench table and immediately got some of that famous truffle butter popcorn, and, guys, it's worth the hype. Completely delicious, buttery, and flavorful in all the right places. We did the a tasting menu with parings so we got to try a lot of different dishes. ��Stand outs were the foi gras, which tasted like strawberry rhubarb pie, the lamb with the morel mushrooms, and the AMAZING chocolate dessert... oh my gosh. good thing this wasn't a buffet or I'd be going back for more. Not so hot on the skate wing with the ham sauce, but my husband liked it well en"
"Top notch gyros, great waiters. No wonder this is a top 100 restaurant in the country. I'm just glad every time I go here I have a good experience no matter who I'm with and what day of the week it is. And great valet service for being free. Go here its a great place for greek eats!"
"After much hype from friends and family, my girlfriend and I decided to check out this higher-end steak house. �� I am a die-hard Wildfire fanatic so naturally I would stack this restaurant up with them...and I must say that I was dissappointed. ��I would say that overall the food was overpriced based on the quality; our calamari was way too mushy for my taste, and we did not even get ""side"" dishes with our steak orders (granted I'm not expecting an entire plate on the side, but while most other steakhouses INCLUDING Wildfire give you at least veggies on the side, we had to pay $8 each for a small side). ��What we DID pay for was not worth the price: the asparagus was OK but not spectacular, and the steamed mushrooms tasted like boiled garbage. ��Sides aside, let's go to the steaks...We both o"
"Went to this place with the girlfriend a few nights ago on a Thursday.The food was absolutely delicious. All sorts of Romanian dishes, the borsch was really good. Really really good. They didn't overdo the whole dracula thing, it only came up as one of their wines, which was pretty good actually.It's a smaller place, but open and nice. The live music and candles made this perfect for a date, but the music wasn't so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation. At one point one of the other guests went up to sing with the guys. At first I thought, oh no this is going going to be awkward. She turned out to pretty good. The owner is nice, a bit eccentric, he seems to throw in some italian and french when he talks to people. And he pays attention to every table but not too pushy. He came up "
Maybe because i came in the store late or i dont know. The soup just taste like water . Worst pho i ever tasted better yet i wasnt even finish and i already see the bill at my table SMH....
"We went here last summer and remembered the yummy bloody marys, but alas the quality has gone downhill. ��I had the most un-enticing and bland breakfast here the other day. ��A scramble does not mean a big trough of eggs with a bunch of oily flavorless vegetables laid on top. ��That is just a mess. ��Why would I pay money for that? ��My husband's trout hash was fishy and didn't taste fresh - and this is a seafood place! ��I've had better coffee at a gas station."
"I have given this place one star because I'm forced to give some sort of star rating. I had been to The Fifty/50 several times before and always had an alright time and decent service. After my last visit though, I will not be returning. I was there on a Friday night with a group of friends. We had bottle service to secure the tables so were there for a while and spent a lot of money. The service was not great all night but it was good enough for a night at a bar and we had a good time for most of the night. When it came time to close out our tab, my husband was informed that the waitress had lost our credit card. Annoying. Further though, the bar's manager was kind of arrogant about it which really was not appreciated. Had the bad experience ended there, I probably wouldn't have bothered "
Delicious - i had a white tuna that was really yummy. The wait was annoying and I ended up sitting at the sushi bar and feeling bad that there were a ton of people waiting for me to eat and free up the table. im tempted to just order it takeout.
"They have the best French-vietnamese(weird combo!). They're expensive though. ��I had the Ga Xao Cari which is chicken with eggplant, mango, string beans and cashews. ��It was amazing."
"PAY WITH CASH ONLY. OR ELSE YOU RISK BEING STOLEN FROM!!!I just opened my Bank of America home page. I was just doing routine budgeting. But I discovered, to my dismay, that VIOLET HOUR STOLE $17 from my bank account!!! You may not think this is a lot, and it's not, but when does it feel good to be robbed???? Here's what happened. My total bill came to $43 dollars. I gave a tip of $7. I paid with my debit card. When I looked in my account, I had a $43 dollar charge followed by a $24 dollar charge. This happened to me once before several years ago and I vowed never to use a card to pay a restaurant. But at some point that wasn't worth the hassle. Then came Violet Hour!Yes the lines are long. Yes the food is only okay. The atmosphere is not necessarily worth the wait. All of that is okay bec"
"We ordered delivery last night. ��The food was delivered within 30 minutes. ��We ordered these rolls: ��main lobster, rainbow, kani chiung, emerald, and spicy tako. ��Everything tasted good, as usual, but a few hours later we were vomiting and didn't stop until every molecule of our dinner was back in the bucket. ��I'm off sushi for now, and off Wakamono forever. ��Kind of sad, and absolutely wrecked our Friday night."
"If you havent been to the Green Mill,you havent lived in Chicago.Sunday nights are the best with Mark Smith and the Poetry Slam.Al Capone,tunnels,jazz and poetry (good and bad) about disparate topics ranging from teenage mutant ninja turtles to vampires.."
Best pizza in Chicago. ��I love this place!!!
"I stumbled upon this place for lunch one afternoon when I was driving around, I was impressed. The ambiance is casual with a festive decor and the option to eat indoors or out but a little bit crowded. Look really cuban.When I informed the waitress taking my order it was my first time there, she eagerly inquired if the order was for me and provided her recommendation of the cuban garden salad with avocado. The service was good and the dog with thegirl at the next door ,right in the middle of the patio �� was really annoying. The chicken garden salad came with tomatoes/onions, added avocado, was very well seasoned and left no disappointment.....very tasty. The food it is not elevated ��not sofisticated, it is simple cuban food but taste great. I must say, I will definitely be back!"
"I love their egg noodle soup with beef brisket, black mushrooms with fried tofu and salted baked chicken! ��I am now a regular customer. ��If you like Hon Kee, you'll like Sun Wah."
"Good god is the food ever incredible!!! ��I recommend the chicken shwarma and the falafel sandwiches. ��The staff is not at all friendly, even when they're not busy, but they make some fantastic food. ��The expanded facility is really quite nice, and the similarly expanded salad bar (more of a buffet, really) is divine. ��Really tasty and not too expensive!It gets BUSY around dinner time, so be prepared for that. ��The wait is worth it, though, and the place isn't nearly as cramped now that they've expanded and updated."
"I cannot believe that more people haven't pointed this out: the service here is terrible. The last time I went here, my friend and I nearly left after it seemed as though we'd been forgotten about. Later, I had to ask for our check after we'd been sitting with our table cleared for ten minutes. After I asked, we waited some more while we could actually see our waiter hanging out and chatting with two other employees by the register. The fact that he knew we were waiting for our check, and yet he still stood around talking and joking, all the while knowing that we could see him put me off so completely that I have to recommend that you forgo this restaurant."
"This place was flat out awesome! ��I went with my girlfriend for our first time, although the coffee wasn't stellar, I got an omelet and she got the lox. ��Every veggie was so so so fresh and tasty. ��I've never had that thought before about freshness (I usually scarf my meals, especially breakfast) but it couldn't be overlooked.The omelet came with all sorts of veggies and even the lox with the uncooked red onion and cucumbers were great. ��The hash browns were also wonderful, I would go back in a heart beat.Highly recommend this place, great job serving breakfast."
"The food is great here. ��I usually take out and haven't dined in yet ,but I can't imagine what kind of service I would get. ��The guy who answers the phone to take my order is always rude."
Favorite fondu spot!
The very best upscale Mexican food in Chicago. I may even say it is one of the best restaurants in the country period. Very consistent quality. Very innovative cuisine. Great atmosphere. Very reasonably priced.
"I went to this place for a late night eat and it was so good. I'm not sure if it's cuz I was eating it after the happy hour or the fact that I was with the really cute girl from the office, but this place sticks in my mind... unlike other events in that evening. I had a great time and the service was fantastic. They were really nice even though I was probably a huge slob and a loud one. We had a great time I will definitely go back."
"I like this place, but it's sort of pricy for what they offer. ��I used to go here on date nights because there wasn't really anything closer to my house until recently. ��I don't like to mad mouth any businesses but I really like to get my money's worth and it just doesn't do it for everyday dining and our server was not friendly the last time I went.I will give it a few more shots because I like to support local businesses, but I really think it thy should revise a few things."
"Sure the Green Mill is a landmark and a jazz institution and the home of the original poetry slam and oh blah blah blah... I love the Green Mill but some of the servers are high on the fumes of their own hubris. Specifically: I was there for the slam last Sunday night and had the WORST bartender experience since Paris. Total asshat. When I asked for an olive for my drink (that he should have put in there in the first place, thanks) he pitched a bitch fit and acted like two steps over to the bowl was the Bataan Death March. Pretended he couldn't understand some people from Wisconsin. Got overly hot-headed with an older lady who accidentally talked while someone was on stage, pointed to the cross she was wearing, and called the pope a German son of a bitch. Plus, he seemed sweaty. An hour in"
"I had the most tasty Bloody Mary followed by a greater than great Egg white omelette filled with the most delicious and extraordinary colorful vegetables... I thought it was a bit loud in the space but no complaints!! of course it is gonna be loud, it is wonderful morning food and I wasn't the only one that would wait in line for a plate filled with an artful and mother-kissed feast... :)"
"We'll I was astounded with this place. I was going to have a mid day brunch with my family and when we walked up to the hostess and another waitress/or other host we were looked at like we meaning latino/s did not belong there! After asking for a table they proceeded to stare us down and laugh. I did not recall asking a funny question. Anyways, I will never go there again and have sent an email to my friends and colleagues to not go there."
"I recommended this place to many of my friends and I will now tell them otherwise due to the lack of customer service, respect and the embarrassment I experienced on my last visit. I was a frequent customer on there crab leg night and the food was usually good. On my last visit I ordered the crab legs and the sides were corn on the cob covered with parmesan cheese and Cole slaw. I tried to eat my corn on the cob and it was really hard to bite because the corn wasn't cooked long enough, it was no biggie I thought I'll just ask the waitress to give me another one that was cooked a little more. I did and she said oh no problem I'll get you another one. Well, the next one was just as hard and tough to eat, so I just gave up and continued to eat my crab legs because after all I wasn't there for"
Not impressed at all.I was expecting more because of the name.
"EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK. Got violent food poisoning at this place and figured I would call to warn them about the beef in question. ��I was courteous (despite being sick as a dog) and the manager refused to investigate or even hear my claim. I was not asking for anything in return but to warn them about the bad beef the night before so that others would not get sick. I had been to Calo before and previously enjoyed the place but after getting sick for 2 days with violent diarrhea and also being treated like a criminal for making a call to the place to warn them, I of course would never return."
"OMG BEST PIZZA EVER. to die for! yum. everyone and anyone needs to go there before they die! amazing food. such nice people work there. i feel like im in italy! great great place! yum. go there alll the time. desserts are great too! pizzza,salads,everything there is great!!"
GREAT FOOD! One of my favorite restaurants! Its where we go for all our special events! Their steak is top notch!
"First off, I heard about Zed451 a few years ago, but never tried them until a few weeks ago for Restaurant week 2012. ��I'm a serious ""Foodie"" and I love to dine down town. ��I frequent downtown restaurants so often that my daughter who is now 11 years old can write a food column because she's been to more restaurants downtown than most adults will visit in their lifetime. ��My family and friends always call me for the best restaurants, so I was excited to go to Zed451 with my sister, brother, and best friend. ��I spoke highly of Zed without having tried them. ��To my shocking surprise they were not impressed!!!I've been to Brazzaz & Fogo and loved them both, but favored Brazzaz because they offered more on their salad bar. ��Anywhoooo........the ambiance of Zed451 was awesome!!!! ��But once the "
"I am a real true Chicagoan born and raised. And as a Chicago girl I must say Superdawg is the best place to get a hotdog. Yeah Gene & Judes in River grove is a close second, but if I am in need of a delicious fat juicy hotdog with crinkle cut fries and let's not forget the green tomato I always go to superawg. I also love their milkshakes too.... I must be honest though I have never tried the hamburger looks good but I can never have anything other than superdawg come out of my mouth when ��I go there. ��I love when you go and they say on the intercom HIYA! that's awesome then even in the winter they will bring the food to your car. Now that's service!! My plea to everyone that reads this visit superdawg you will not be disappointed"
I love Sunda! Best sushi around. Unique dishes and amazing atmosphere. Try the Toro - top notch!
"RonR Message flagged Tuesday, July 3, 2012 6:40 PMI passed by Garcia's for years. Then, one winter day I stopped in and had a really delicious bowl of Chicken soup. It was fantastic, it comes with two generous pieces of chicken, you should specify white or dark meat, plenty of crunchy vegetables, and a really tasty broth. I recommend it. And, it is not expensive and, it is a meal.The chips and dips are also very good.Another time I tried the chicken flautas. hard, rolled tortillas filled with the meat of your choice. ��Comes with sour cream, guacamole in which to dip your flautas, fried beans, etc. Probably the best flautas I have ever had in Chicago.Maybe I've just beenlucky as I found the service to be very good even when crowded. The noise level is pretty high when they are crowded, poor"
Delicious! You won't be disappointed with anything on this menu -- and they have great vegan items as well!
I love the chicken artopeta and the lemon soup. ��The food is always fresh and the service is great. ��It's worth stopping by if you are ever in Greek town
"It has become common knowledge among my friends that if you ask me where I want to eat, my first choice will always be Opart Thai. ��The food is cheap, the atmosphere is much nicer than other Thai joints in town, it's BYOB & the food is DELICIOUS! ��I don't know what else I can really say..."
"Incredible!My fiancee and I brought some friends in from Boston last week and we were all blown away by our experience. ��From top to bottom, this was a great evening. ��First off, the restaurant is beautiful. ��Although a little difficult to find (it's inconspicuously located in the Blackstone Hotel) the decor and vibe is perfect. ��Great attention to detail.We were seated within five minutes of our reservation and our table was smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. ��Great views and plenty of space.Our server (Fred on the check) was over promptly to tell us about the menu and offer drink suggestions. ��Although the restaurant was packed, we all felt like we were shown plenty of attention. ��After a great description of the menu and cuisine, we decided to be adventurous and go with the chef"
"As a vegan i have heard tons about this place, finally got go there. Been veg 5 years, decided to get the 'meatiest' thing on the menu - the BBQ Bacon Burger and some sweet potato fries of course. All i can say is WOW. it was some amazing food, don't think i've scarfed down food that fast before. Definitely left me craving to go back, shame they don't expand! I would be there every day. As for the hype - of course! it's delicious and cruelty free! I went on a Sunday - there were lines but the wait was less then 10 minutes. Seating is packed but i didn't mind it - it actually causes convos to spark between tables so you might make some friends. Food was served super fast, waiters were very friendly and extremely informative on their menu items. Daiya cheese! they have it. What more can i sa"
"Awesome food, great prices, cool staff."
"So we went out with two other couples for what we had hoped would be a great meal here and I've never had a more disappointing experience in my life. If I could give zero stars, I would.The place was an absolute madhouse. We got seated out on the patio, which was a beautiful setting. The service is slow and we waited a long time for our food. While we are waiting, the restaurant staff keeps adding chairs to a table across from us until finally, it is completely blocking the aisle. A little while later, the hostess comes up to us with another group she is going to seat and demands that we get up and move our chairs, so she can get by. We're so surprised, we do it without arguing. Five minutes later, she tries to do it again. This time we refuse and she starts getting testy with us but we wo"
Little crowded for me but great food. ��Fun lunch spot.
"My co-worker told me I had to stop at Grand Lux Cafe while in Chicago. So I did. The place is very fancy looking, and I was wearing jeans, so I was a little worried that they had a dress code. But there were people there in jeans and suits, so it was really quite the mix.When we got there, we were told it was a 10-15 minute wait. So we sat down with our buzzer. But after about 20 minutes, I noticed that people who came in after us were being seated. I talked to the hostess, and apparently someone had made a mistake when they put our names down. She told me to wait on the side, and continued to take other customers.Finally we got seated about 5 minutes later. I was a little upset at this point because we didn't get an apology for the mix up/mistake, and wait, or an explanation really. So I "
"I love me some Italian food so going to Piccolo Sogno last Sunday night was a major plus for me. ��I normally go to my old standby of Francesca's on Taylor St so I was intrigued by what others had told me about PS. ��We came for a birthday party and I was impressed by the warm decor and intimate setup. ��Ordered some calamari which was hot (important for me!) and very good, my wife ordered the braised short ribs on polenta very tender and yummy. ��I ordered the special pasta with Parmesan and mushroom which was light on taste but good nevertheless. ��Overall I was impressed about Piccolo Sogno and would go again. ��Va Bene!"
"Hockey will always be on, beer will be flowing, and great pizza will be baking..."
"I have visited this place a few times, never being thrilled about the food or service-- and certainly not about the prices. ��The last time was the last straw. ��The waiter seemed indifferent, refused a coupon that was given to my friend by a local merchant-- though that may be the merchant's fault for distributing expired coupons-- and rushed us, asking us how our food was a minute after bringing it to us (we had not even tasted it yet). ��Then he brought the check before all of us were finished. ��Okay, message received.All of that would not have upset me, but I developed food poisoning shortly thereafter. ��I'm not saying that Uncommon Ground definitely gave it to me, but it seems strange that the same night, after eating their salad, I vomited lettuce. I missed two days of work as a result,"
"Who says you HAVE to get the pig stuff? ��Got the chicken kebabs and the fried sardines! (both of which were very good: the chicken was juicy and tender, if not a little boring; the sardines were fried to perfection)But, of course, our group ordered lots of pig stuff (you have to you have to...both because this is the purple pig and also because its so good). 1. The bone marrow was very good and obviously quite rich. ��I found after the first couple slices of toast it became too much, but I definitely encourage you to try it.2. The pork shoulder is a favorite of mine. I've been to the purple pig a couple times now, and this is one of my favorite dishes. 3. Finally, the pig's ear with crispy kale! If you could only order one dish, get this one! The pig's ear is deliciously fried, complemented"
Unbelieve food and experience... This blog pretty much sums it up....http://forksandcorkschicago.com/2011/01/14/�_schwa-chicagos-tiny-piece-of-culinary-heaven/... if you can get yourself a reservation...go!
"the place that started me off...my family owns this spot....gave us the means to open La Palapita...im here every night especially on weekends as security...love this place cuz without it i would probably be nothing...awesome food, quick service(depending on which of the 3 u go to), and safe atmosphere....great for a night out with the guys/girls and especially after hittin the bars and clubs on the scene...great food..and im not sayin that cuz it family...it is genuine....grandma cooks like this back in texas and so do we in our private parties...family recipes make for great food...and hey...its been open since '76...obviously we'er doing something right...-Peace"
"This place used to be a favorite of mine and a couple of coworkers for after-work dessert and drinks. Never again. The last two times that I went were enough for me to refuse to ever go back again. The first time, the waiter took our order, brought out our side dishes and then promptly disappeared for 30 minutes without letting us know about our main course. ��After awhile, we got up, paid for what we ate, and left. The next visit, we had a different waiter who was incredibly rude and actually swore at me. The salad, desserts, and coffee are all great, but not enough to make up for the horrible service."
"AMAZING! The food, the ambiance, the art work, the staff - all fabu! ��The event (not just dinner) started at Valet as they asked us for us by name. ��Seating was quick and the service was unbelievable. ��It is VERY expensive (1000 for 3 people), but if you can afford it, it is worth the cost. ��You even get an escort to the washroom. ��The waitstaff orchestrated every detail to down to how and when water was poured!As we left, we even got fresh muffins for breakfast! ��If I had the money, I would go back again! ��Hmmm....Tru caviar staircase!I must say that even after the very lenghty meal (3 plus hours and 10 plus courses), we were still hungry and headed to Sullivans for a nice juicy steak:) The staff was better than the actual food, but it was an amazing experience."
"Clearly, I won't be writing a review that will replace the one they have on a postcard, extolling the crappy aspects of the place. I love Longman! Things I particularly enjoyed on my recent (of MANY) visits:*Kentucky Fried Quail*Wild Boar Sloppy Joe*Zabuton*Pea Agnolotti (friend from SF said it was the best thing he'd eaten during his week in Chicago)*La Fin du Monde (anyplace that serves this is tops with me)The fact that they're Michelin-starred means the Michelin people know what they're doing."
"This place is SOO DELICIOUS. It's one of my favorite places now!One of my really good friends mentioned this place to me a couple of months back. We finally had a chance to try it last month, and I cannot believe we waited this long to come here!Between two people plus with cocktails and tip it was less than 100 dollars. We eat a lot though for small people... we probably ate enough for 2 adults and 1 child. We ordered a formaggi and salumi tray (three meats, one cheese) and it came with a delicious strawberry marmalade and bread. My friend does not like marmalade but he thoroughly enjoyed their homemade one! We then went on to have the truffle egg toast which was FANTASTIC. You absolutely must order this if you come here!! The bread was delicious warm and slightly toasted and the egg was "
Ordered the q2 as a take out for lunch and it was simply fabulous. ��The prices are reasonable and I am looking forward to going to dinner there soon. ��Enjoyed the different sauces as well as the pickles. ��The ribs were a good size and smoked perfectly. ��We ordered the pulled pork and it was excellent as well. ��Did not like the coleslaw--will try the fries next time.
"Everything from start to finish was great. From the bread at the beginning to the desert at the end. Fresh, hot, and tasty. Best carrot cake ever. Good deal being Monday evening and taking advantage of the 3 course prefix (able to chose anything from the menu almost) ) Great service. Couple things I took note of but not bothered by. When a restaurant has a full house.. It's going to be loud. The only other thing is a little cramped w the seating. You will know what your neighbors are up to.Overall:GREAT DINNER"
"Good Restaurant - Not Great, ��We liked Ras Dashen better. ��The honey wine was pretty good."
"best pizza in the world! ��i live in SF. ��we have the worst pizza in SF. ��i've been craving gino's east for over a year now. ��it's crowded, expensive and you'll have to wait 45 min for your pizza. ��i say so what! ��i'll wait all day for the best deep dish chicago has to offer! ��the staff is super friendly and even though i was sitting at the bar (fastest way to get the food), a nice female server came up to me to make sure everything was going well. ��drinks are over priced and don't order any shots there. ��actually, don't order any shots in chicago in any place. ��they are small and nothing like what we do here in cali. best pizza in the world! ��i miss you gino's east!"
"Great food, great ambiance, great service and great music. ��Its a must try no matter what your taste is. ��Take it from me- its a GREAT place"
"NUEVO LEON IS THE SHIT-and I mean that in a great way. Not sure how it doesn't have more than 5 stars overall on here.The prices are TERRIFIC-nothing is over $12! You get a complimentary appetizer-always amazing! You get free chips and salsa. All of the food there is great, plus you always get so much that even paying $12 for carne asada is a great deal. Most meals come with refried beans and rice. The carne asada also has tortillas. Drinks are all $1 and come in cans. Plus the place is BYOB-how great is that. Service is ALWAYS great and fast. While pretty much everything is amazing, here are the very, very few minor downfalls:Only take cash-however there is an ATM right next to the register.Free parking right down the street-usually there is room, but on some nights it does get busy so yo"
"I've always had a lovely experience at Coast, and this weekend I tried carry out for the first time from there. It was an excellent experience!! I called on a Friday evening at 7:30 pm. The person that answered was friendly, reliable, and efficient although it sounded very busy in the background. When I went to pick up my food the place was packed with about 50 people waiting for a table. This added to my delight as the customer service did not fail no matter how busy they were. And yes, the sushi was delicious."
"What did i just put inside me?Superdawg is so terrible that i dont even know where to begin.Overpriced.Oversoggy.Overhyped!The bun has a soft, slimy texture that to some may be appealing, but i enjoy food rather than slop. ��The relish has a neon green glow to it that is unsettling to look at. ��In fact, i'm positive that it was the number one cause of the stomach ailment im currently hampering.The fries are the only reason i've given this place one star. ��They are made there fresh, which raises my brow because of the filthy setting they are produced in. ��However, the taste of the fry is pretty satisfying, so i wont harp on it too much.You want my advice? ��Go to Gene n' Judes. ��Quality Hot Dogs. ��Good enough to cater a wedding!"
"Went here for the first time about six months after I kept hearing coworkers rave about their deep dish pizza. Since then, I have been back almost once a week for weekend outings with friends - I even went here to celebrate my birthday! Normally I get a medium deep dish pepperoni so that I have plenty to take home but last time I added sausage and it was great - they put on chunks of delicious and juicy meat. The only other thing I have had here (besides plenty of booze) is the garlic bread, which was very subpar. Nothing special. Stick with the pizza!"
True Italian in close quarters. Reasonable prices and a nice bar area.
"WARNING: Website prices are wrong!!! ASnd they know it. They are claiming their own site is two years old and they can't change the prices. When I placed an order, they overcharged by $7. I called back and quoted their prices on their printed menu AND their web site and they insisted that they had no control over their own web site AND our printed menu was too old. Not cool...not cool at all."
"Very nice place. Great brunch place, delicious eggs. The waffles are pretty good too, I'm not a big fan of their homemade jams though. It can get busy and the wait is worth it!! Personally I love their Sunday special Mediterranean skillet"
"Whats that other place kumas cor....... ��WHO CARES �� ��Hands Down Best Burgers in city!!!!!! �� ��Not really into heavy metal anymore but.... The 30 some flat screens is cool. Half owners I meet are Cocky jerks, but This guy asked us our opinions of the joint. Asked me what i wanted to hear on all tv screens I told him Guns N' Roses 5 mins later thats what was on all screens. I guess you just have to make him laugh a couple times for him to throw shot glasses and a bottle of Jameson on the table for a free shot. Tue. half price burgers & cheap drinks new Tue. spot. THE BAD I went to work the last 2 Wed. at noon instead of 7 A.M."
"Haven't been back here for the past 2+ years. ��For some reason I got sick of their Pho twice. ��Everything else are fine and decent tasting with reasonable pricing. ��You gotta give it to them on the number of dishes on their menu. ��If you're an indecisive person, the menu can be a little intimidating. ��Probably will go back and give the Pho another try one of the these days."
"Sometimes I randomly crave their Seoul Sassy chicken. ��Crisp is probably hands down my favorite restaurant in the city. ��I'm from Hawaii, so I'm really judgmental of Asian food. ��The only other equivalent to the Seoul Sassy chicken is the Korean Fried Chicken from Zippy's in Hawaii, and let's face it, Crisp might be better and is so much closer. ��I love this place because it has great food, especially for the price. ��Everyone who has eaten at any Korean restaurant knows that Korean food is not cheap.My boyfriend and I usually split the whole chicken combo for $19.99 (comes with 2 cans of pop and 2 sides). ��It's perfect for sharing and sometimes we'll have enough for one lunch the next day."
"I'm a huge Sushi Lover, I've had Sushi In Seattle,New York,Las Vegas,California you name it I've tried it. I'm not saying this place is the best because I'm from chicago but Coast Sushi has never failed to Impress me. Every Time i go there it feels like my first time. The Sushi is soooo fresh and just melts in your mouthh aahhhh lol cant talk about it now. I always get the same rolls the White Dragon is by far my fav. The Spicy Scallop,Spicy Ebi and the Najma Jalapeno. It's also byob which is pretty cool. You Must try this place !!"
"I have visited Anteprima several times with a Milanese friend living in Andersonville. ��We were disappointed every time. ��Yes, the menu is authentic and the pricing fair. ��However, the service -- or lack thereof -- is enough for us to have sworn off returning. ��Excellent service can elevate a meal to new levels. �� At the same time, poor service can ruin the experience entirely. ��I'm sorry to say... the later is the rule at Anteprima. ��And hey... I gave it three tries.The food is tasty and well prepared. ��But it is far from fabulous and nowhere near Chicago's best Italian cuisine. ��The ambiance is average, although outdoor dining in the summer is worth the trip at least once. ��Inside, however, dinner chat is overrun by a reverberating din.If you are looking for reasonably-priced Italian foo"
"A delicious first experience with Korean BBQ. ��I went with a friend who was not familiar with the cuisine either. ��Since I haven't tried other Korean BBQ places I thought I should only give it 4 stars, but it was one of the best meals I have had for quite some time. ��We went on a Sunday around 9pm and didn't have to wait to be seated. ��And we spent around $50, but there were plenty of leftovers. ��We couldn't find parking, but there was plenty of parking on the side street right by it.We had the seafood pancake and I believe the kalbi (I feel embarassed I don't remember the name, but it was #18 on the BBQ and it was beef). ��Since it was a serving for one person they cooked it in back rather than at our table. ��I don't cook red meat very often, and I actually preferred that they cooked it. ��"
"I had been hoping for a chance to dine at this restaurant since I first saw Rick Bayless on Top Chef. I felt a little nervous bringing my friend and her Mexican mother to a trendy Mexican restaurant, but we were all pleasantly surprised. My friend's mom thought that all the food was very authentic and I loved the food as well. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the fact that we got there at 11:05AM and had a 20 minute wait before ordering. But the food was definitely worth the wait!"
Pizza...... Yummy and the Italian Beef on garlic bread and cheese....uh very yummy!!!
"get the shrimp and grits or ham and grits if youre not a shrimp fan for an app, its the best. i always get whatever fish they have as a special and its always good! prices are great too not overpriced at all. love it!"
"I just had the best meatloaf and potatoes I've had in years. Even though the service was a bit slow, my husband, three sons and I had a delightful meal here. We will be back!!"
"I'm not sure the point of reviewing Coast is there anyone left who hasn't been there. Coast is a typical BYOB local sushi spot. The food is not nearly as good as the heavy hitters (Mirai, Arami) but it is also not nearly as expensive. They offer the normal dragons rolls you would expect. The servise is fine, the ambience is ok (a little loud) overall a decent sushi option."
"My absolute favorite restaurant in Chicago. ��We've been coming here since this place opened up. ��We celebrated the New Year in '99 with friends, and I still remember it.At about $75 for two people (not including alcohol), it's a pretty decent price for a good night out. ��My husband usually orders the filet sampler, which I still to the filet, cooked rare. ��We usually have the mashed potatoes as a side, and try to save room for dessert. ��I'm partial to their key lime pie.If you don't have a reservation, you can still eat at one of the bar tables, without a wait.I recommend this to friends looking for a place to celebrate an anniversary."
Havent found a better buritto in over 15 years. ��Come all the way from OHare now just for the buritto. ��People from out of town I've taken here beg me to bring them again as one of the highlights for visiting.
"I have been to Icosium Kafe on multiple occasions. At first I thought it was great like everyone else but now I realize how terrible it really is. First, it takes FOREVER to get your food no matter if they have a full house or you are the only person there. Second, the owner is a RUDE man who has absolutely no customer service skills or manners in general. Third, the food is NOT worth the price! Everything is about $3-4 dollars too much for the quality of the food. I was disappointed because I was really excited when I first found Icosium but I definitely do not plan to eat here again."
"My name is Quoc-Viet Nguyen and im from Kansas City. I have been to many Vietnamese restaurant from Dallas, California, Missouri, Chicago etc. I believe Simply it has the best service and quality of food that a vietnamese restaurant ever had.I have been to Argyle, Little Saigon or Viettown in Chicago many times. I have been to Tank Noodle, Pho Viet, Pho 777, Pho 888, etc and the food their is alright. I am from UIC campus so its a long trip out there, but going to get Pho up their gave me my Pho kick when i was craving vietnamese food. At first i was skeptical ?because what vietnamese restaurant is in Lincoln Park and called Simply IT ? It was really strange to me, but some vietnamese guy i met at the apple store on Michigan avenue said it was better food than Viet town. So i went, and it "
"cheese curds, handcut fries, great burgers and a good beer list. cant ask for much more, right?"
"The Chicago Diner is great! The staff are incredibly friendly, and the food is great. I must admit I am hooked on their ceasar wrap, and crave it regularly.The only sad thing for me is that they have become very busy over the past year. The wait doesn't seem to be too terrible. The longest I have waited is 45 minutes. (and that was on pride... I'm surprised it wasn't longer)Oh... And they have the most amazing Chicago Soy Dairy milkshakes...!! To die for!!:)"
"I first saw this place on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives but I didn't plan on stopping in until I Googled All-you-can-eat Crab Legs for my husband's birthday. ��This is not a normal diner, they serve cereal at the bar in the back and have their whole menu on chalkboards on both walls. ��I made reservations a week in advance just to be sure we could get in - I would suggest this because the line was pretty long when we got here and pretty long when we left. ��You start off getting a pretty decent portion of crab legs with parmesean corn and coleslaw, after that they bring you out one crag leg at a time and you can order more corn and slaw if you'd like. ��He also ordered a 40 of Miller Lite, yes I said a 40 oz.. ��The crab legs started off great (especially for what you would pay at Joe's or Shaw'"
"My husband and I LOVE Mayan Palace. ��It is close to our house and definitely our favorite spot for Mexican. ��We probably eat here an average of two or three times a month, especially in summer when their lovely covered outdoor patio is open in back, doubling the capacity of the restaurant. ��We usually order the taco dinner and the tacos al pastor are a hands down favorite, although other dishes I've tried have been delicious as well. ��I'm not a huge fan of refried beans, but I enjoy them here with the rice and tacos! ��My husband is from El Salvador and he loves the guac, salsa and unlimited slices of lime here. ��The waitstaff and manager recognize us now and are always very friendly and attentive -- and it's a ��great place to practice your Spanish if you're trying to learn, like me! ��Servi"
My very first experience with authentic Chicago deep dish pizza. They let us know right away how long it was going to take for it to bake. Service was prompt and was everything I would expect from such a great place!
"Went to dinner at Mia's and it really never disappoints. Great fresh caprese salad, and tasty lava cake for dessert. The only complaint I had is that the bathrooms were messy, and it was way too cold. Otherwise, they are awesome"
"Named in homage to a SR22 insurance company television commercial mascot, this establishment features chill food and delicious atmosphere; it's like Montmartre meets Portland in Lil' San Juan. My only problem: when do I get to come back? No, seriously, when will that restraining order be lifted? I luv you, Longman & Eagle! Lay an egg on my car hood before the locals steal my car battery!"
"Very good, if not top 5, option for Sushi in chicago. i just went here last night and it was very good. The maki is exceptional and their are some very creative combinations."
"Food. Great. �� Price. Greater. ��Service. Needs improvement. ��I am a big fan of giving credit where its due and not just complaining. The ONLY thing wrong with this restaurant is the pace of service. Everything else is GREAT! ��The ambience, the FOOD, and the price. ��I am so glad that this place exists because its a grea go to spot when my friends or family are in town. ��Check it out if you can. �� So good."
"This place has the best basil chicken in Chicago. ��Full-flavoured (if you request it so), basil added at just the right time to maintain its fragrance, and chicken very well seasoned and not to dry. ��Not as spicy as it could have been, but overall, it was still excellent.That being said, don't bother with the Khao Soy, with pineapple but no chili, more sweet than it was spicy. ��I'll definately be back, and will update this review accordingly."
"Hot chocolate was the best part. ��Sandwiches are delicious, soup was a little too salty."
"I went with some friends a few months ago on a busy Friday evening. My mood was slightly depressed but when I entered Sun Wah, my mood began to uplift.The service was not that good but the atmosphere was lively. Not enough wait staff at all ! I'm not a big fan of Chinese food and mainly went for the duck. We ordered a few side dished which were nothing spectacular at all...the duck however was Delicious !!!! The next time I go back there I will be ordering 2 ducks and nothing else but a side of rice. Best DUCK I EVER HAD :) so i forgive for the crappy service"
Fancy... and one does pay for the fanciness. I just needed more love from the server and more cheese. Just such a teeny cheese portion? For my great big dollar? but the wine is all reasonable and in stock and good.
I was their last night and i wasnt impressed from the food that much. the setting is nice and the atmospher is good.
"Food was AWESOME! ��Super-creative menu, nice wine/beer selection. Sat at the bar as there was a wait for tables. Service was a little slow, but I highly recommend!"
"Whatever on the wait. I think I get this place. You wait an hour for food, by the time you're served it's been a little over an hour, anything you get tossed seems like baby Jesus made it. Arrrgh I'm starved this is great! Or not?I dunno.Duck fat fries. Soggy. I like crispy. You gotta be slightly on the dorky side to stand around ?for sausages. Seriously, get over it. Yeah it's good, but is this it? Good not great. Whatever dorks enjoy."
"Excellent!!! ��Always an awesome meal. ��Have been going here for about 12 or 13 year now and have never had a bad experience. ��I've also been to several other locations including a few in the burbs and have always had great food and excellent service. ��If you're looking for great, authentic italian food look no further. ��The locations on Taylor and Bryn Mawr are equally good as well"
"When I'm down in Andersonville, this has become THE place to have brunch. My boyfriend likes the Eggs Roshambo and I cry over the eggs New Orleans every time I have it, it's SOOOO good. Just to tast the orange juice (they squeeze their own organic oranges) and you can tell you're in a place that serves quality. The service is in a different league than any other brunch spot I've been to as well: they don't seem like they care if they turn your table it's like, ""sit down, relax we're gonna take care of you for a while."" Oh, and did I mention beignets???Only been to dinner once, but the BF freaked over his ribs (for good reason, I sampled one of course - delish!) and my trout special was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had. Mississippi Mud Pie. Do it."
I really feel that La Pasadita has an authentic mexican taste and I love the steak soft tacos. ��Great for late night chow!
"i really want to like this place but after my 3rd visit i decided NOT to come back again.This place looks really cool, small and cozy, you feel you are not in Chicago! Good food choices, BYOB is a plus, outdoor sitting.1st time I came here, the food was excellent but then I had to run in the bathroom for No 2. I have eaten to many places over my 28 years and this never happened to me before. I wasn't going to come back but the 2nd time I came here was with a group of friends that wanted to try this place. Whatever. 2nd time around, the sandwich I had was just ok, the goat cheese empanadas are the best here and the exotic drinks, the calamari was the most HORRIBLE calamari I ever tried in my life! And to top it off I paid nearly 40$ for something I didn't enjoy. Yeap, the food here is expen"
all i have to say is amazing ��especially if u love meat
Cory approved.
"Can I rave about this place enough? I frequently tell my friends that this is the best Thai in the city. I miss living in Ravenswood--I used to walk over here weekly and get food!The food is excellent. Beyond excellent. I'm drooling thinking about it now. This place is always quiet, too. The service is very hands-off, but they are polite and do check in with you frequently--they just let you have a quiet meal. Highly recommend for a dinner party, date, or even just take-out."
"Okay seriously, do I really have to write a review to convince you to at least try this place out. Recently moved back to the CHI from NYC and Piece has the same taste it did when I left....THANK YOU! P.S. Love all the new addtions on the brew menu!"
My very very favorite place for a great dinner...atmosphere and great food and service!!
"Whenever anyone asks what my favorite restaurant is I smile and say Sultan's Market. I've tried almost everything on the menu and loved it all. I've taken probably 20 friends there over the past few years and they all love it. The staff is extremely friendly and it is a family owned business with charm. Best dishes? Falafel sandwich is always great but also try the vegetarian combo, tilapia, baked egg and cheese fatia, or the always fresh salad bar. BEST PLACE EVER."
"Wife loves this place. I get swashbuckled into waiting 45 minutes for a table here about once every other month. IS the food good? Yeah. I'llshovel it in as shamelessly as the next guy, but i'd be just as happy with no wait at a diner. Chocolate stuffed, gold crusted pancakes with dancing leprachaun garnishes can only be so good."
"How could you not love the basmati rice with saffron... I think they are true culinary gurus over here. Persian food is so delicious, and you just keep returning to try different dishes. My favorite dish is the lamb shank... make sure to get the baba ganoush as an appetizer to open up those taste buds. And not to forget the Doogh (no, it's not proncounced dog)! It's kind of a watery yoghurt mixed with salt. It goes well with the rice and meat. Gonna try the Khorest Gheime next time.. a curry with yellow lentils and tomatoes. The service is always friendly and they have the right decor to set the low key ambience."
"Spacca Napoli has become one of my girlfriend's and my favorite places. ��The pizzas come out lightning fast, but we slow the pace down by ordering a couple of appetizers and a bottle of wine. ��Service has always been fantastic, and we wrap up dinner with tiramisu and limoncello.I have always lived in the US, so my experiences with other cultures are what I've learned while vacationing. ��Having found the place in Naples, Italy where, it is said, pizza was invented, Spacca Napoli is a great place to reminisce about my girlfriend's and my travels. ��The margarita pizzas are nearly identical to what we ordered while in Italy.For pizza, its a pricey place for a quick dinner-for-two on the town, but as a date restaurant, its a winner! ��(As a heads-up: The pizzas are best to be enjoyed at Spacca N"
"I think they snuck into my building the first time they delivered. Since naturally I am a nudist in my apartment, I was not delighted by their stealth. However, every delivery they have made has so far included complimentary fruit--usually oranges, but sometimes more exotic things (and once, complimentary smoothies!). I always order their Pho soup, which I think is delicate and aromatic, and their Saigonese crepe, which is equally in-crepe-able. The physical restaurant, itself, is just ok."
Sunda is amazing! ��I cannot wait to go again. ��Get the rock shrimp and crab hand-roll. �� Sunda is the best!
"Waking up from a hectic Lollapalooza friday me and my Buddy were in the mood for food, not any type of food but breakfast food. and Since our hotel was directly to the right of this place we said meh what the heck. We were first a little worried since they had a waiting list, which wasn't even much of a wait. We were lead to our seats and automatically our order was taken and even given some direction as to what would tickle our fancy. Food was in front of us in 10 minutes tops and let me remind you this was during LOLLAPALOOZA and everyone made their way there. amazing portions, we couldn't finish half and we had those bad boys for lunch.Take the time out if you have it to give this place a chance. Oh and Great prices our bill was 22 bucks and we got the works"
"I love this little place. The food is excellent, the restaurant always seems clean and the prices aren't bad. The only reason that I didn't give a 5 star review is the fact that the service is generally slow... even to be seated. Despite this oversight it is definitely a great place to eat."
"Sunday night, in the midst of the first official snow storm to hit Chicago, I ventured with the Windy City Pizza Club to Piece. I easily could have stayed in and kept warm, but there was something about Piece that I had to have. When I first approached the restaurant I was pleasantly surprised by how large and full the place was. It was only when I saw the menu, with drinks such as Camel Toe and the like, that made me discover why this hole in the wall is such a hit. As much as I love deep dish, the wide selection of toppings such as Mashed Potatoes and Bacon make this place distinct and unlike any other restaurant you will find. If you're a pizza lover, I highly recommend stopping by this place for their BBQ Style pizza."
"My food was great, it was a chicken with prosciutto and a pasta with a garlic sause. My girlfriend's pasta dumplings in pesto was a bit overcooked and needed more flavor. I was expecting a more romantic ambiance from the reviews, but it was really loud and not romantic at all. The waiter was very attentive which was good and gave us a complimentary desert and liquor drink for my girlfriend's birthday which was very nice."
"Awesome music. ��Great drinks.At all costs, avoid the poetry slam night. ��Not sure what they're thinking. ��I want jazz, not bad poetry."
"Unbelievably, this restaurant called at 4pm today to cancel the reservation that we have had for six weeks. We had confirmed yesterday for a special occasion dinner. I understand that sometimes problems arise--but other reviews warned us this may happen. And calling within 2.5 hours of the scheduled reservation to cancel on a Saturday night??? We don't have a prayer of getting another reservation at this point... so disappointing. Needless to say, the offer to reschedule for another night is not one I will be taking up."
"If you enjoy the sandwich, this place knows the sandwich. Great ingredients, great bread, interesting sides. Loved it....absolutely loved it."
"Whenever I travel to Chicago, the Green Mill is one of my usual stops. ��There is a reason this place is legendary: a steady calendar of some of the very best jazz (of all different styles) that you are likely to find anywhere. ��And at reasonable prices, to boot, when compared to NY or DC.If you're there on a Wednesday night and jazz singer Kurt Elling is in town, you're in for a rare treat; this is his regular gig whenever he is back home. ��You'll be able to hear this multiple-award-winning jazz vocalist pretty up close and personal, for a fraction of what it would cost to catch him at venues in other cities, and in a setting where it's possible to chat with him between sets (and he's a charming, approachable guy).Whomever you catch there, be prepared to enjoy music among serious jazz affi"
"OMG!! If I was having Korean for the first time, this place would have totally ruin my first experience. ��SERVICE is HORRIBLE!!! ��We sat for a good 15-20 minutes until someone came to take our order and on top of that, I had to ask for water. ��Don't sit down resturants generally give you water right away before taking order?? �� When the lady brought the water, she had her head face toward the floor where you can litterally see the top of her head as she's approaching our table with the tray of water. My friend said maybe it's a culture thing and I didnt think so because I've ate at a lot of Korean places and the first thing you hear when you walk through any korean joint is... ""Anyeasayo!"" ��Didn't get that here! ��The pickled side dishes tasted OLD like they've been sitting out for days. ��T"
This was my first time coming to Coast and I was really excited to try it! I am not a big sushi fanatic but I definitely enjoy the specialty rolls.My friend and I didn't bring any wine but we definitely would for our next trip to Coast.We both started off with the Spicy Miso soup- it was delicious! Served in heavy mug and topped off with slices of jalapenos! For sushi we order the King Crab and White Dragon.I really like the White Dragon as it was extremely flavorful. I would go with the White Dragon again and maybe try something else next time instead of the King Crab-another it was very good as well.For dessert ��my friend got the lychee sorbet and I got two little mochis- the white chocolate raspberry one was awesome!! Over all Coast is very intimate and a great date place an very well p
"The people were very friendly, from taking the reservation to the host to the waiter everyone took the time to make our dinner a nice experience. A two piece band played great background music. The room/decor is nice, but not as fancy or dressy as i thought it would be for a special occasion location. Food was very good. I would definitely go back."
"Now I suppose this review could be biased. It's been several months since I actually ate here. And when I was there, I was on a date with a guy who gives me massive rose colored glasses. But still. I get so annoyed at people who go to a place like Graham Elliot and then complain about the food to cost ratio. We had the 10 course tasting with pairings...yes, the courses are small. But the tastes are amazing and you don't leave hungry. If you want big portions, there are some lovely steakhouses in Chicago. The pairings were very unusual - at least to me. There was one snafu with the dessert pairing, but the waiter and mixologist were so sweet and apologetic and quick to bring us an additional dessert and cocktail that it was almost a *positive* part of the experience. I don't think Graham El"
love love love love love love everything about this place. this is a well oiled machine!!
The place was very crowded but the waitress was nice.The carne asada was REALLY GOOD but the chicken tostadas were not..
"Worst Pizza in Chicago, but #1 for personal abuse!I saw the sign - ""Best Pan Pizza in Chicago."" ��I've been seeing that sign for a couple of years. ��I saw some good reviews online, and then I heard (2nd hand) that it was great. ��So I pack up my daughter, and off we go.What we find is no table service - just a cafeteria-type counter and a lot of slices we can order. ��There's a nice variety and we order a few different slices to try. ��We find a table, sit down, go find some silverware (there is no waitstaff here at all), and start to eat.We discover that all the pizza we are eating is undercooked - the dough is raw, and the meats are still pink inside - totally disgusting! ��We take them up to the counter, and the manager refuses to even look at the pizza slices we're complaining about. ��""That"
"Top to bottom it is the best pizza i've ever had. You have to eat it there fresh out of the oven and piping hot. I could live off of the crust alone. Who cares about the appeteizer, or the drinks or anything else. Its about the Pizza and this is hands down the best there is no questions asked."
Amazing service! Loved the burgers staff was very nice! I can't stop going back!
I STILL CANT HELP MYSELF... Back again for a deep dish.. So fattening but so yummy. ��quick service and affordable prices. very close to home..
"Great food, great service. ��Does any other restaurant bring you a complimentary appetizer and ginger tea while you wait for your table? ��Then, bring a complimentary dessert after dinner because you had to wait? ��And the wait wasn't even that long (20 minutes, max). ��I've been here a couple times now and will definitely be back for more."
"Can't get enough of this stuff. Best Mexican food I have ever had in my short life. You must try the rice water- don't get a glass, get a pitcher."
"I love this place! it's cheap and you get a lot of food. so far, best mexican resturant i've been at. Horchata is yummmmmmy, just had some last night :)"
"My friends and I are always looking for good ethnic restaurants to try. ��Demera being one of the few Ethiopian restaurants we had tried in Chicago was amazing. ��The place itself seems authentic. Whenever we're in the Chicago area, my Ethiopian friend always suggests that we go to Demera. Normally when people try food from their own country in America, the food itself has been changed completely to match the taste buds of the people here, but she enjoys the food thoroughly. Although I live in the Suburbs, when I have cravings for Ethiopian food, Demera is the one place that I would drive to get it."
"Great Experience! ��Pricey but good food, is a three hour dinner. ��Service was amazing."
"OK, I went to La Villa with the wife after seeing the positive reviews on Check Please. ��Wow, Yelpers. I am really beginning to wonder how many of you really know your food. The place is pleasant enough and the staff IS very friendly and welcoming. But, the problem was not with the dining experience, but with the food. I wondered what the positive reviewers on Check Please meant by ""home made."" If they mean, they opened the can at home, then I guess that is accurate. I can buy canned food at the Jewel for a lot less. Most items on the salad bar were from cans, perhaps dressed up with some sliced onions or something. But, canned. My chicken ala Villa was 2 fried chicken breasts with cheese and canned mushrooms in a sauce that reminded me of Campbells soup. The dominant flavor was salt. Mayb"
"great food with bold flavors and great execution, good service and fun atmosphere."
"awesomeawesomeawesome. Of course on a Fri night the place was jammed, but we were treated well, seated about 20 min later than our reservations, and had a top notch waitress who told us what to expect, and we were not disappointed at all. The food is not cheap, but this was a no holds barred dinner for my family and will be a lifetime memory of indulgence. Oyster sampler and huge lobsters, YUM. We WILL go back when we go to Chicago."
I live right by Garcia's and my friends and I were craving Mexican food so we happen to walk in and i fell in love amazing food! It beats tbk any day;). I'm a small person but every time i go to Garcia i end up eating so many things and they are all soooo amazing!!Hurry up and re open!!!!! Whoever posted these pics stop it...i'm having Garcia withdraws and the pics are making me hungry :(!! hehe
"This has become our place for pizza, and now for chicken. Been trying to do the lighter eating thing this month, so we have been on the salad and better foods deal. ��We have been ordering the Chicken Dinner here with sides of corn and garlic rice..Lasts us 2 meals, is charbroiled, not fried, and tastes great(like 11 bucks I think). �� Cant drop my pizza urge, but orderd the Napolitana pizza that is light with Regiano(???) Parmesan cheese and basil...I tried it as a slice there, and loved it, so we ordered it for delivery this week.. �� Great food, friendly service, good delivery(like normally 45 to an hour) in this neighborhood..Keep it going Fogo!!!"
"My husband and I just went to this restaurant on 8/11/11. ��I ordered the General Tso's chicken and he ordered the orange chicken. ��This is actually the second time I've been here, and I can't see myself returning. The chicken was so hard and tough that it was difficult to cut and eat, especially without a knife. The texture of the meat was also a little questionable. It was extremely tough and unlike any chicken I've ever had. The sauce over the chicken was the only thing I liked. While we were there it was really uncomfortable because in the middle of dinner the manager went off on one of the cooks and waitstaff. He was yelling so loudly across the restaurant that the whole restaurant turned to watch him. I thought I saw the manager even hit the cook a few times. The manager looked like a"
good delivery sushi roll place
"Great Chicago style Super Dawgs.Service is punctual, but friendliness by staff is limited.Note to travelers or first timers: Know what you're going to order before you talk to a server, do not call them hot dogs as they will not serve you then. Ask for super dawgs. AND if you must have ketchup, which is taboo in Chicago on hot dogs, ask for it on the side for your fries."
I have been here once and enjoyed the food and service. I ordered the ribs while my wife ordered the pasta and salad special. We were both very pleased and will be coming back.
If you're a vegetarian or vegan this place will make you very happy. ��If not then you really need to consider becoming a vegetarian or vegan.
"Well, the name may throw you off. Simply It does not specialize in silver tea seats or modern couches. It is a Vietnamese restaurant and Simply Awesome! This restaurant is definitely a jem. It is the kind of place you meet a friend you haven't seen in awhile and want to impress. Oh, (fill in your name) this place is so cute, the food is authentic and it's cheap! Nice work! That's when you nod at the owner who treats all his customers like old fishing buddies. The owner and his family are the Vietnamese version of the Cosby's. I felt like a regular on my first visit there. My friends who frequent the restaurant have gotten to know the owner and the menu very well. Today the owner sent them away with a bag of fresh bing cherries. Now some restaurants may send you away with some spring rolls."
Their seoul sassy chicken wings are SOOO BOMBBB!
"4 star - Damn Good/Bringing ItDammmmn Good !!!!!!! New York Pizza has nothing on Chicago's Gino ��East Deep Dish Pizza. My most recent visit to Gino East I had the meaty legend deep dish. My father in law wanted to get the thin crust pizza, which was vetoed by ��myself and the waiter. While waiting for our pizza we we decided to have the Fried Ravioli, which was a nice touch before the pizza came out (45 mins). Service was alright except the pither of soda we ordered was sent back twice for having black paticles in it. Time to clean the soda fountain sprouts. Thats why you get the four and not the five. This place has a nice tourist ambience if you are from out of town. If your doing deep dish in Chicago - I reccommend Gino's."
"My boyfriend and I stopped in here for an early dinner (or a late lunch for us) for his birthday. I've been curious about this restaurant for a while now and I couldn't afford Frontera Grill or Topolobampo, so Xoco was perfect. We had probably a 5 minute wait, so I guess we were really lucky. I had the Choriqueso( Homemade chorizo sausage, roasted poblano, artisan Jack cheese, tomatillo salsa. $9.00)was delicious! The verde salsa it came with was amazing. My boyfriend had the Cubana (Smoked Gunthorp pork loin and bacon, black beans, avocado, artisan Jack, chipotle mustard. $11.50) and he really enjoyed it. To drink, I had the Agua de Jamaica and it was sooooo good! I highly recommend it if you like sweet fruit teas. For dessert, we had a piece of the Choco-Flan and a Churro...Both were to "
"Great ambiance, amazing food. The staff is wonderful. I have gone three weeks in a row and plan on going again soon. A great summer get-a-way."
"I've lived in Chicago for over a decade and pride myself on knowing good spots to eat out. Mastro's is by far the best steakhouse in town! From the drinks to the entrees, there isn't a single flaw on the menu. Seafood and meat eaters alike will be thrilled with their options, and no dish disappoints. I ordered the petit filet and it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. (big fan of gibson's -this was WAY better!) my husband ordered the bone in filet and loved it - had plenty to take home for lunch or dinner the next day.) love that their salads are big enough to share we split the Spicy Mambo, Like a ceasar salad packing a punch,and were very pleased. Gorgonzola Mac & cheese and creamed spinach sides are noteworthy...and though no one had room for dessert, we just had to try the butter ca"
We tried this on our date night and it was pretty decent. However the waitress overcharged us on drinks but when we brought it to her attention she compt us drinks and offered us a free desert.
"After the first bite of the warm potato/grilled octopus starter, my partner and I looked at each other and said, ""We don't have to travel to Italy anymore."" ��Seriously. ��Everything that chef Carlos Ysaguirre makes is as good as anything you'd eat in Italy. ��And for the same reasons -- he gets the best ingredients from the best local farmers, and then gets out of the way. ��The trofie al pesto was even better than what we had in Liguria (birthplace of the dish) a year ago -- restrained and elegant, rustic and hearty -- all at the same time. ��The food, the service, the ambience -- all are superb."
"Graham Elliot was a great dining experience.Everything from the music playing in the background ��to the juxtaposition of fine dining in a completely casual atmosphere, made this not only one of my great dining experiences, but also a place I would suggest to just about any foodie looking for a good time.We had the tasting menu, which I would recommend to anyone coming here for the first time. ��The drinks were also very tasty. ��We tried the Man-jito All in all, this is one of my absolute favorite spots in Chicago. ��Highly recommended!!"
"This place is one of my all-time favorites. It has a wonderful atmosphere and the service is really great. ��The staffs here are always super nice. You can't go wrong here, whether you order sushi or Thai. Now they offer good wine selection. Last time I tried ginger martini, perfect! my friend love asian mojito. It's also BYOB ��with very small corkage fee $1.25."
I love love LOVE this place....seriously thee best for all the kinds of meat that makes you melt. The service is great! I have been here 7 times and each time is better then the next. The fried bananas are awesome!!!
"I haven't had anything on the menu besides the salad bar, but it's really good. The best thing in the salad bar is the chocolate chip cream cheese spread...delicious! ��It gets crowded here, but you can usually get seated within 1/2 hour."
Consistently great food.
"beyond outstanding, service, wine, dessert. Ill have my birthday there every year"
"The place was dirty, the service was bad, food quality and presentation went done the toilet. ��I knew the owner who came from Chengdu China. ��But he is so involved in other business deals, he has no time to take care of the restaurant business. ��What a shame!! Only place for people who have no clue what is real Szechuan (or Sichuan) food!"
I really like the gage. The service is always very good and the food is good value for the quality of the food that you receive. I have tried their fish and chips which I think are the best in Chicago and my friend had a 3 sausage platter.The one lost star is for the really cold place that we sat in. We sat near the entrance in the elevated area and everytime a person entered or exited the gage a really cold blast of air would keep our table cold for another 5 minutes afterwards. I should have asked to move but didn't want to be difficult.
"I didn't think I was going be a fan of deep-dish pizza, but the all meat concoction that was served to us may very well have been the best pizza I've ever eaten. The wait was projected to be like 40 minutes, but my girlfriend and I scabbed bar seats after like 20. I admit we were tourist and had no idea how good it was going to be. The pitcher prices were very reasonable, but the drinks we ordered afterword were a little pricey. The pizza seemed expensive until it arrived and we realized how deep the pizza actually was. The service was friendly, and I can't wait to go back and eat there again."
"You will not find a better Greek restaurant in Chicago. Its so good i don't even know where to begin. Saganaki Great, Avagalemeno Soup Great, and my favorite the Lamb Chops so amazing and juicy. And if you can make room for dessert try the rice pudding! Last but not least i think their service is almost as good as the food and that's saying a lot. The waiters with their thick Greek accents it just seems like anytime you need them they just are right there, service for sure A+"
I have been here several times and every time was a good experience. Great atmosphere about the place probably because of the history behind it. If you never been its a must even if you don't listen to jazz music
"I like this place! ��The atmosphere is pretty good and the food was good too. ��Next time I'm up that way, I'm going to bring some friends back!"
"OK, so we've been to Big Jones on three consecutive Saturdays for brunch. The food is unbelievably freaking good. The cuisine is ""coastal southern"" which works out to lots of hearty southern fare with a more than your usual mix of seafood, crabcakes, etc. This isn't diner food -- while brunch is clearly a great idea, it's up a notch from the Golden Nugget. The food is, without question, among my favorites in Chicago. It's also locally and sustainably sourced, which is rad. Things I like there: they do a biscuits and gravy that is so complicated you feel like that traditional white gravy was somehow cheating you. It's a redeye gravy over sweet potato biscuits, and comes with a big pile of southern greens and andoulle sausage. Mwah! The Eggs New Orleans is also ridiculously good. Poached egg"
"Vegan. There's a word that can scare the appetite out of you!! I heard about the Chicago Diner from some of my crazy runner friends and I drove past it yesterday on the way to my friend's house (A.K.A - Polish party girl, who always finds herself in the midst of some kind of sh**t-storm, only to drink vodka and laugh her way out of it). I didn't have a lot of time on my hands, but I decided to park with my hazards on and run in to check out. Inside I was greeted with vintage ads and neon lights, what I understood to be the atmosphere that owners Mickey Hornick and partner Chef Jo Kaucher were going for. They were quoted as saying they wanted to make the restaurant as American as mini malls Instead of french fries, they serve home fries. They offer vegan milkshakes and not dogs for kids. Mo"
"Really enjoyed this place! Any combo plates from here will do! And I like how they give you a starter plate to begin with, not like at Reza's where they charge you an arm and a leg for. Too bad Reza's isn't the same, they used to be great. Noon O Kabab will do for now!"
"I am so tempted to give this place a bad review just so people stop coming here and we can get a reservation.This is my favorite restaurant. Ever. I've probably been here about 5 times, and every time it's brilliant. I've heard it described as the skate punk Alinea, which I think is so dead on. Actually, I think it's better than Alinea. I've had a dish I didn't like at Alinea, but I've never had anything other than exceptional food here.I come from a family of near-carnivores, who rarely touch a vegetable, unless it's a potato. Schwa served us beets once and we not only ate them, we practically licked the plate. I think that's the mark of a truly incredible restaurant--regardless of the personal food preferences of the diners, they have the ability to make any ingredient taste amazing.Also"
"I've been to BRAZZAZ, Texas de brazil and Fogo de chao. The best is Fogo. brazzaz and texas send coupon buy 1 get 1 free dinner on your B-day. go to fogo during lunch time from 10am-2pm - the same menu, but cheaper."
Great food and atmosphere.
"I was excited to head back to one of my favorite places in Chicago. Cafe 28 has been, for me, a place that I used to always go back to knowing that I would get great service and better food. Recently, I took my brother and his wife from out of town. What a disappointment! First we were told to wait for a table outside and when we were seated there were plenty of tables available. The wait staff was lacking attention and detail and the food was not nearly as good as it was before. The pork chops were once the talk of the town. Now, they are dry and much smaller than in the past. After 10 years of going to this restaurant, I can honestly say that I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
"Delicious!I came here with an omnivore friend who wasn't sure if they had a lot of vegetarian choices, so I was a little skeptical to begin with, but I was blown away.We shared this appetizer which was a portobella mushroom topped with literally the best soy beef I've ever had and some cheese. If that was the entire meal, I could have left very, very pleased, but there was even more goodness involved... A Tofu sandwich with incredibly flavorful and non-slimy tofu, beans, and other veggies (very filling and delicious) and these long, crispy plantain chips with this garlic sauce spread over them that I have yet to stop craving. If you haven't eaten here yet, you should.Not everything was perfect- It is a pretty small place (but cute, and they have a patio), and it took a while to get our foo"
"Well, this is my first ever restaurant review since I don't normally get too excited or too upset about any food or service. ?But I could not help commenting this time because of the horrible experience. ?I have to say that the environment and food were both OK, but the service was the worst I ever had in ANY restaurant. ?From the moment we sit down it appeared like we owe the server lots of money. ?He did not respond at all when asked about the food and it looked like he wanted to say you don't know what you order anyway, so just order anything and get the hell out of here. ?When I order, he did not explain anything, even when I asked him what comes with the dish. ?At the end, he took away the appetizer without asking; claiming that he could NOT split a check; run up to collect the checks"
i love this place!
YUMMMMMMMMMMYYYY!!!!!I love it. ��Love their ham and havarti. ��Go get it!
"The food is fine, possibly slighlty better than other fine restaurants. The ambient is beautiful and my wife loved it. The tables are too close each other and it is quite difficult to make a conversation in the table. The waitress was nice, a little bit disoriented when asked about the dishes, not explaining well the menu. The dishes ARE VERY VERY SMALL and I do not think the price is fair at all. The price is out of proportion to the size and quality of the dishes. OVERPRICED. The popcorn was a disroganized cheese and carbohydrates, all together, a mess!. It took 35-40 min to get the pork dish. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant and I won't come back in the future. This restaurant is for people who loves the chef."
"The first time I ate Pequod's was when we had staff meeting at a clinic I used to work at. ?At first, I was wondering what the char was on the crust (I'm not questioning why, but what is it?). ?My boss said it was cheese, and that made it even better. ?Their pizza was very unique, thin crust attributes (accidental caramel crust, loaded looking) with the appeal of a stuffed pie (the more to love deal). ?It was good, good enough to realize that I sometimes forget that it was a deep dish. ?However, to me, the only thing that really got me interested in their pizza was the crust. ?The cheese peeled/fell off often, that forced me to reset most of the pizza back on the crust. ?And because of caramelizing, the crust was very soggy underneath. ?Either way, interesting concept, tasty, but hard to o"
"Glenn's is definitely a charming place - from the cereal bar, the artwork on the walls to the staff, my family immediately fell in love with this diner.We went for the Sunday breakfast today (did the Call Ahead) and were seated immediately. ?Many patrons were known by name when they arrived and the line of patrons was steady and moving.We were at Glenn's for one hour and from the moment we walked in to the time we left the staff was wonderful. ?Gary, our waiter, was very attentive to not only our table, but all those in his section, the entire time.Gary knew the menu - his description of the heat in the New Orleans Scramble was right on the mark. ?I was able to order my iced coffee the way I like it (plain coffee over lots of ice - not the fancy flavor stuff) and it was served iced not luk"
"This place is cozy and authentic. ��The people are interesting, the food is fantastic (oatmeal shake, yuca fries with loads of garlic, and their sandwiches). ��I was told to go there and I now tell you!"
"I agree with all the good reviews that appear here. We went for dinner on a Wednesday night, got there around 7:30 pm. ��We had none of the bad experiences some reviewers listed. Overall, service was very good, as well as the food and the prices. We will go again to India House"
"I took my honey & the family here for his birthday ""EXCELLENT"" choice. It was the first time for all of us & we loved it. The food was delicious, the drinks were on point, & the staff was friendly. We all will be back for more!"
"Ah, Irazu you've spoiled me. Veggie burritos are so yummy, and the guacamole is thick, creamy and wonderful with their homemade chips. Love the tilapia, the plantains, yucca, just about everything and yes, those oatmeal/soy shakes. Now that they deliver, it's disgusting how often we pig out on their food. One of Bucktown's finest."
"A thoroughly unpretentious, delicious and enjoyable experience. ��From the moment I walked in and was greeted by a smiling and personable, professional hostess I felt well taken care of -- but without that stuffy faux-formality that you'll find at those shall-remain-nameless, so-called ""legendary"" Chicago chophouses within blocks of this place. Great food, great service and reasonable prices. ��A gem of a find in downtown Chicago."
"Great pizza. The stuffed special (sausage, onion, pepper) is delicious. Also have great daily deals where they give you a ton of food. Nice work."
"The food is unbelievable. Everyone said it all already, but I will say one thing different than others...I've been here 4 times, and each time I saw people taking pictures of their food -- it was really weird when someone asked if they could take a picture of MY food. Get ready for a really different experience here. I don't remember art being on the walls (but maybe there is?) -- what I remember is thinking WOW - the art is on my plate!My perception of the place was different based upon who I brought -- 4 different people. Go with someone who appreciates fine dining and someone who doesn't mind eating unusual food."
"I am so delighted that I went on a date here. The food was amazing and at a great price. Plus, BYOB! hooray."
I've been here quite a few times but not anymore. The food could be so much better. Maybe things were different two decades ago but I get better vegan food at a non-vegan restaurants that offer a vegan entre; for example vegan bi bim bop at a Korean place or falafel wraps at a Lebanese place. I just feel like there is way too much fake meat in everything. It's like I'm eating veggie slop. Also the desserts are so dense. ��I've made so many vegan desserts at home that taste way better that what is served here.The service is great and there are some tasty foods. I'm not saying it is all bad.
"I love the decor and interior of the restaurant, it's huge! But it screams Cheesecake Factory..I'm not sure who's been around first?Service: The wait was short about 15 minutes (lunch and dinner)The hosts and servers were really friendly and helpful. Though somebody could have cleared the plates off our table faster. We almost got full on the bread before our orders actually came so service was a little slow.Food:I had a little of everything. The pasta tasted undercooked and the sauces were bland. The chicken parmesan was the only dish that I couldn't go wrong with.I would go back to try more stuff since it might have just been a bad first experience."
I Traveled to Chicago during a business trip in September. We decided to eat at Ginos to experience Chicago pizza. WORST DECISION EVER!! 2 of my colleagues and I split the deep dish meat lovers pizza & antipasto salad and we all got food poisoning. I was the worst out of the 3 of us. I was so sick I missed my last day of training and had to change my flight to the following day; spending the last day of my trip deathly ill in a hotel room. It was horrible! DO NOT go to this restaurant!!!
"Went to Sunda the other night for a benefit for people affected by the crisis in Japan. If ever a restaurant deserves 5 stars, it's Sunda. The food is incredible. The truffled tataki tuna and American kobe sashimi were perhaps the best things I've ever tasted. But what makes Sunda special goes beyond the menu. The owners/partners, Billy and Aaron, and the staff, all donated their time and effort. Even the wonderful servers donated ��their tips! The result was a amazing evening that afforded Chicagoans an opportunity to get behind a worthwhile cause. In the end, Sunda raised $50,000 for people in Japan (of which Direct Relief commits 100% to Japan relief efforts). The generosity of this place can't be overstated. When you eat at Sunda, not only will you enjoy a world-class meal, you will be "
Great Greek Food. ��You get alot of food for your money. ��Would highly recommend it.
"Fox & Obel is a difficult place to give a single rating to because it is made up of many different pieces. ��I'll review each separately, from the good to the bad to well, you know the rest.Grocery (5/5):We live across the street from Fox & Obel and love the convenience and selection. ��They have a great variety of different specialty options that you won't find elsewhere. ��They have a great cheese selection, a huge craft beer selection, more chocolate than you can imagine, coffees from around the world, meats, etc. ��If you're looking for something unique or high-end, this is the place for you. ��The prices aren't outrageous, but you're certainly going to pay more than you would at larger chain grocery stores.Desserts (5/5):Our usual stop is the dessert counter when we go to Fox & Obel. ��Thei"
I really love this place... you cant go wrong with the Peking duck dinner.... Didnt use to like duck till i tried it here.... the rest of the menu items are really good 2...If its a busy weekend night expect the service to be a little slow but you got to expect that with it beingsuch a popular place.
My friends and I went there for dinner on Sunday evening and everything was great from start to finish. ��Not only did we get to sit on the gorgeous patio but we were also paired with an awesome server named Mary Rose. ��She had a great personality and was very knowledgeable with all aspects of the menu.
"I've been going to the 3rd Coast for years and it never disappoints - cozy, comfortable, good food, friendly service and reasonable prices. ��Especially love the raspberry scones and lattes at breakfast!"
"great place, great food. very trendy!highly recommend, trying to get a table for dinner might be a little harder. great menu for lunch!"
"Cool place but really bad food. Design is ultra modern, terrace bar is fantastic. Shuttle service is pretty handy for hard drinkers. However, they should focus on their food and improve it big time."
"This is the single worst experience I've had in a restaurant. Our party started the evening by being denied the service of any alchohol. Without explanation or acknowledgement even, we forged ahead with the meal, hoping the quality of the food would make up for the less than sane decision making process of general manager, and practacing champaign Nazi, Jenny Estes. Alas! Crazy Jenny Estes pailed in comparison to the charms of head Chef, Jorge Fernandez. This child decided to garnish one of our meals with 5 large black hairs from his own head. Fernandez admitted with a grin that the hair belonged to him. 5 out of our 11 entrees arrived incorrectly prepared, one was missing entirely. We ended the evening with a visit from our friends, the Chicago Police, who had been alerted to our lack of "
Puhh..... Totally overrated !!!! I ve been to many Itelien places and this one is just average !! But for this very high price?? I dont think so !!! I definately will NOT go again !!We had Salad- the sauce was way too sour. The pasta was okay- but again just avarage and in a way to greasy sauce !!
"At the beginning we had a good waitress, explained the menu, and gave suggestions. ��We took those and ordered a few items to start. ��The first ""devil's basket"" was rubbery and not good. ��We finally tracked down our waitress 15 minutes later and told her it wasn't right. ��She told my husband later that chef agreed-not their standard and comp'd. ��Ok-next we got the WRONG order and again after finally finding her the response was ""sorry"". ��Our correct order never showed. ��Asked to speak to Mgr. ��Orville comp'd the second item from our bill since it never showed, I should hope so. �� While I was speaking to Orville the waitress interrupted our conversation twice to justify the event. ��It was an unfortunate experience but an experienced wait person knows to back off and let the mgr handle it, (w"
The service was the worst I have seen in a long time. ��We barely sat down and the waitress wanted to take our entire order--not just drinks. ��We said we weren't ready but I don't think she understood since she pointed out what dishes she recommended. ��She finally left but literally came back a minute later. ��She did this several more times until we felt pressured to order right then.My two friends ordered the BBQ. ��I ordered a rice dish. ��My friends were half way through their meal and I still did not get my entree. ��I finally flagged down a waitress (don't expect to see them again until time for the check and don't count on being asked if you want anything else). ��She said it would be right out. ��Then 10 minutes later our soup arrived (at the end of my friends' meals) but still no entree 
"I've been here two times and luckily, i didn't experience the long wait. Anyways, this place has good food. However, tables are so close that you could easily hear someone's conversation two tables over. The second time i went there, i was sat to a table that was only 3 inches away from me. It was by the corner. I had the breakfast burrito, it was good. Also tried the french tower toast. Yes, it's amazing hands down. But, there's a catch. There is sooooo muuuuucccccchhhhhhhh calories in that thing that will hold you back the entire day. I regret eating it. Yet, it's something good once in a while, as in maybe every six months for a little taste. Not something to get used too though."
"0 Stars- The rude bouncer at the door ruined our visit. He singled out 1 person in our group and refused to let her in, then called us liars when we tried to tell him she wasn't even drunk. What a jerk. He had the short man complex, like he had to be a tough guy because he was so small and bald. Well needless to say didn't go in and we won't be back. Lousy customer service."
"Great food, great atmosphere! I am typically not the type of person to love those new, cliche restaurants that are launched by a group of Chicago nightlife staples. ��Sunda definitely proved to be an exception! ��I went with my extended family for my mom's birthday. ��We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table which were all amazing. ��The wrinkled green beans were so delicious we had to get a second order and I am still trying to figure out how to replicate them at home! ��I couldn't decide what to get for my main dish (the menu is huge) and ended up getting riddled with anxiety when the waiter came by me and just ordered some sushi. ��I ordered two of the signature rolls which were both phenom! ��My sister ordered the duck which was also amazing and one of my cousins ordered the pork - also"
"I was disturbed by the rather large piece of art in the back dining area that said I hate girls ?I was disappointed first because it was lame. It had no compelling aesthetic merit. ?The artistic statement did not point to wanting to engage in any conversation that would maybe, maybe redeem the statement. It just left me sad and was a reminder of how women and girls can continue to be maligned even in unexpected places. Enter in other groups of people oppressed in the phrase I hate_____ and it would be far more unacceptable. ?It made looking at the hipster waiters walking around in their levis and expensive plaid shirts all the more unbearable. ?so cliche and disappointing."
Sunda was great from beginning to end. I went ��w/ a large group that I work with and I was extremely impressed. ��We just left our ordering up to the server who did an excellent job. ��All the sushi and rolls that we ordered were excellent and the Kobe appetizer over rice melted in your mouth. The brussel sprout salad was an extremely pleasant surprise-even the people at the table who don't like brussel sprouts were coming back for second and thirds. ��I would come back here again and again. ��Great place for a date night or business dinner.
"So we decided to go to the 50/50 this past Saturday and I have to say I am less then impressed, frankly not impressed at all. I had better service at a no name bar then I did at one who supposedly has it name in the circle. Our waitress for our group was more concerned with pulling up her fifty/50 tube top then serving us with the proper service than any corner bar would be able to do. She was rude and short with us, and it took a long time for us to get our drinks. Yes, we understand it was a weekend and it's busy, but one can only think she would be apologetic. Instead she shrugged it off, maybe it was her age, she appeared to be in her early 20's, but one would think with the proper training ""service"" would be the first task of training. It is apparent that she needs to be retrained on "
"Other than the price of the food, this place is perfection. It has a great atmosphere, a commitment to our environment, live music, and amazing food. The ""whoopee pie"" is a must. It has sugar cookies and carrot gelato. We also had some sort of pear tart that was nearly as incredible.If you are looking for great organic fine dining, Uncommon ground is the place to be in Chicago."
There is one thing which turned me off.....Theres a dish called panang curry...it has brocolli in it...and for some reason i dont like brocolli....so while ordering i asked to substitute brocolli with bell peppers....and they said its extra $1 for substiutions...and i was like...its not a chicken-shrimp substitution or anything like that....but she said that is their policy....i am totally confused...bell pepper is cheaper than brocolli...so why charge extra buck for this substitution....they should rather be happy......anyways....since this philosophy turned me off...i didnt order food.... but really wanted to try for first time......:(
"I love Italian food, Sapori is definitely one of my favorite places for Italian.It get crazy busy so make sure to make reservation especially on weekend. I always order the fried calamari and split a meal with my hubby. (except for the lobster ravioli, it's only 5 or 6)Sign up to be in there mailing list and you'll be receiving great coupons!"
"I woke up this morning after eating at The Bad Apple with my lady last night and my first waking thought was how incredibly delicious and pleasant this place was. So I came to Yelp about it.As we walked in on a Saturday night. We were told the wait would be about 25 minutes for 2. So we go to the bar and order a couple of beers and to our surprise, the hostess came within 10 minutes and sat us at a table.I, for one, could not pull my eyes from the extensive beer menu (24 on draft, 150 in bottles, and 13 in cans.) And the beers on average were about $5. Including imports and micro-brews. We ordered about 8 different beers in total.Onto the food. As a guy who enjoys a burger, I went straight to the renown burger page. I ordered the Red Dragon w/ truffle fries and she ordered the Happy Belly "
my friends brought the best birthday cake for my husband from here and it was to die for. they got the red velvet cake with cream cheese icing and oh my goodness it was just party in my mouth and in my stomach. my husband liked the personalized touch. we will definitely keep going there for their baked goods!
Killer strawberry margaritas at this place! ��I ordered cheese quesadillas and enjoyed every bite of them. ��The service is aboveaverage too. ��Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. ��We didn't have to wait long for anything and it was a busy Wednesday evening.One of my new favorite places.
"This place is good - great food, nice atmosphere, the lounge is awesome.That said, the staff is one of the rudest i've ever come across, ever. I work in the neighborhood, and every single time i've walked into alliance the person at the counter - actually, the PEOPLE at the counter - have consistently ignored me, not given eye contact, been entirely unresponsive, etc... I don't know if this is the store's appeal to the hipster contingent, but I've lived in several cities and Alliance is the only place that can stick out in recent memory with a staff this obnoxious. Since the place is nice and reasonably priced and the food is delicious, i can't give it a low rating... but man, hopefully they'll hire some more pleasant people than they have now!"
"i have high expectations for korean food since my bestfriend's mother has spoiled me. great price for allllll the food you get!!!! many ethnic restaurants can be uncomfortable and down right hostile at times, but you dont get that feeling here. i was extremely comfortable with the diverse group of friends i was with! although, our waitress could barely speak english, she smiled and made sure we were satisfied. ��it truly is authentic food!"
"Yes, drinks are expensive. ��Yes, there is ALWAYS a line. ��YES THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. ��Their drinks are out of this world. ��What a great date spot, GNO spot, pre-game or after hours spot. ��I love it here. ��Friendly staff and great decor as well."
fucking love it.
Great place for great pizza and amazing beer. ��Thursday is karaoke and always draws a crowd.
"Some of the previous reviewers need to relax. ��This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in Chicago. Great food (the cheese fondue and the dessert fondue were the best) and great ambiance. The entrees served with the premier dinner were good, but I've never been a fan of entrees at fondue restaurants. I'd recommend just getting the cheese and chocolate. Much better ambiance than melting pot and feels much less corporate. ��Very romantic!"
"In a word: CARELESS. When done correctly the steaks are marvelous. ��I've been there twice in recent months. ��This time my medium rare came to the table well done. ��Last time one of my associate's med-rare came well done. ��Since I won't eat overcooked meat, I took most of my $38 steak with me because our table of nine was on desert when I was served. ��Arrived at 7:30 left at 11:00... you figure out how much we talked and twiddled while the steaks burned.."
"Highly flavorful and elevated food in a non pretentious setting (and no it's not pretentious by virtue of trying hard not to be). I loved almost every dish that came out and whaaaat? It's BYOB! ?This is not your daddy's Charlie Trotter's.If people would describe you as two or more of the following, boring, old, an accountant's accountant, staid, buttoned-up, high-strung, from the gold coast then please save yourself a cardiac and don't go. While I can understand frustrations with last minute cancellations I suggest that it's part of the contract you sign with Schwa. This is part of what you are agreeing to when you make reservations. Schwa has a unique history with its star chef and is unapologetic for being anti-establishment. Also, let us consider how many times all of us have canceled o"
"I wish there were vegan meals that didn't feel the need to emulate meat. Not that the meals themselves are trying to be meat.Anyway, I just feel slightly less than satisfied whenever I leave. I paid too much. The food was kinda bland. I must admit I've never had dessert or their shakes. Why do I keep coming back?Probably the lack of other vegan options in this city. eh..."
"I'm going to say one positive thing about this before i continue with the negative, BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE i ever got. The waiters were so fuken FRIENDLY, they made me feel really comfortable being here! :) N E ways, i spent many hours trying to look for a fancy to casual mexican restaurant, and i chose the mayan mexican cuisine. Why i chose it? I liked their website! But dont judge a website by its cover, : | The restaurant was small and pretty calm. I was not WoWEd about their food though, it was allright but maybe cuz i was STARVING! I'm mexican, and i've tried better tacos than that! For the price, the food amount wasn't that much, that's another thing i wasn't impressed with. Me and my friend were celebrating our senior graduation there and we wanted to eat in the patio. First of all t"
"Everything..... mean EVERYTHING is wonderful - the moment you stepped in the door of Sunda to time you leave! Servers and people are very warm and welcoming! The food is to ""die"" for and to top it off - affordable/reasonable for restaurants found in Down Town Chicago. I would highly suggest for the appetizer - Kobe beef on top of crunchy rice; for the main course - adobo and for dessert - Taro pudding (!!!!!)"
"Wow!Went here for dinner last week, I can still taste the filet mignon.....melts in your mouth like butter. The best steak I have ever had. Our waitress was very friendly and humorous, sometimes hard to find in nice restaurants downtown. Not stuffy at all. The steaks are very generous, well worth the money. You can eat a la carte style, they have great sides to pair with the steaks. My only complaint concerns the bartenders that served us while we were waiting for a table....first they charged us for a drink we did not have (we only had 2, how difficult is that?) and then were kind of rude when we tried to correct our tab. But other than that, great food, great time!"
"what's not to love about this place? i am a regular pete shelly kind of girl. but doug knowing his customers by name, his favorite buzzcocks songs in the background, and its growing group of chicago regulars make this independent business shine set."
"If anyone out there is looking for a justification to the arm and leg paid for a dinner at Alinea, let this be it. Although the cost of one dinner at this place may not be so easily digested, let me assure you it is an experience worth having. To be completely honest, I was nervous about eating at Alinea for the first time. My boyfriend and I decided to prepare for a night of food sin. We did the 25-course meal, the larger of the 2 choices. We were pleasantly surprised, after walking through the spaceship-like entrance, to be seated in a very intimate white room, much resembling the family room in my grandmother's house. The room held about 6 small tables seating 2-4 people. The wait staff was very informative and friendly, humoring us and our lack of knowledge of the wine selection with b"
"We called ahead and arranged a party for twenty for my daughters bachelorette party, we prearranged the menu and were served immediately. the food was delicious, the service was wonderful, the staff explained what each dish was and the wine we brought was poured for us. we had a great time and felt like we were the only party in the restaurant. the place was full the whole time we were there, but the service certainly didn't feel like it. i will be coming back and will suggest visiting this jewel to everyone that visits Chicago."
"Violet Hour is me and my wifes favorite place in the city. We've been going there regularly the last year. The ambience is great, all of the staff is very very nice and friendly, and the cocktails are just fantastic."
very great good
"I have nothing but love for this place, its people and its food. Everything that's good about a neighborhood pizza place can be found here. This is the best pizza outside of Italy and by far the best in the country.I have nothing more to add that hasn't been already written, but one thing: The quality hasn't declined at all after Jon opened the expansion. Keep up the good work Spacca. We'll support you."
"Alliance created the most wonderful 40 cupcakes for my baby shower. ��My favorite was the red velvet, but the vanilla, chocolate and carrot cake were also amazing. ��This is a great place to cater your dessert bar or to stop in for a quick bite. ��They have great teas for enjoying in their too-cool sidewalk area."
"An endless fount of creative, delicious cocktails. I've never eaten the food here, we always just get a drink or two and soak up the scene. I have always found it completely mysterious that people will go to bars, pay the ripoff cocktail prices charged at many places, and stand because there aren't enough seats. Well hooray for the Violet Hour, I'd rather be kept out in the cold than let into a horribly uncomfortable environment and served a $10 drink by some inept bartender that shakes the gin, and have to stand in a drunken crowd whilst trying not to spill my overfilled cocktail glass of liquor so sorrowfully diluted by endless shaking.At the Violet Hour, you must have a seat, which is comfy, the noise level is perfect (the curtains help measurably with the acoustics) and the drinks are "
Culinary mastery and taste bud bliss. ��The atmosphere is funky and relaxed; the people are encouraging and fun. ��Well worth the wait. For sure.
"If you don't give 5 stars, you're crazy.I used to live in the Andersonville neighborhood, and Calo is by far the place I miss the most. ��The service is friendly; take-out and eat-in are both pure pleasure. ��The pizza bread is so warm and tasty, and the pastas are always yummy. ��But the gem of this joint is the minestone. ��I have never craved soup like I do now, and nothing satisfies that like Calo! ��The wine list is great with a nice price range presented. ��One more amazing thing about this place is its hours. ��After Christmas shopping all day downtown, getting caught in a snowstorm, and fighting for a cab for 45 minutes, it was a delight to find out Calo was open late. ��And serving soup."
"Each and every time I visit them I'm always happy with their product, price and friendly service... it never ceases to amaze me the new items they create, they're all great! While I've tried nearly all the menu items, my staple is their DAGWOOD creation :) with extra sauce... it NEVER fails to overfill me all the time... the rest of my family too enjoys trying their new/seasonal items. Please remember if you're looking for HEALTH food, while they're meat free since '83 and non dairy is always an option, it's still a diner :)"
"Do not understand what the Fuzz is about this place. It was the worst Pizza i have ever had. I drove from the suburbs on Saturday and figured i pick up instead of waiting since the place was crowded with the young ones drinking. As i drove home i started eating a slice for the road. Well! the dough was chewy, the ends were burnt and there was not enough cheese. What a dissappointment. The pizza was so greasy that after sitting in the car for the drive home it looked so grosse that i ended up throwing it out. After spending $18 for a small pizza ,driving 23 miles to get it . i would not dare put that piece of food in my body. Sorry but it is the truth.Will never be ordering there again.As a matter of fact i should off driven back for a refund.What a waste."
"This is a gem of a place, but I highly recommend going at off-times if you plan to talk with the people in your party. The noise level when the place is full leaves my ears ringing in a manner normally reserved for rock concerts. With that said, the food really is rather fantastic. I've been to Mia Francesca many, many times and never had a dish that didn't make me swoon. Their appetizers are especially delightful."
Horrible! ��Way overpriced for Chicago. ��Order never showed up while the kept pushing the overpriced drinks. ��Never again. ��Go to Eno across the street.
"This place is pretty rad. Went here a few weeks back. Cool neighborhood and the wait, well it was average for a weekend night. Aside from that, the food and beer was good. I highly suggest the double I.PA. Oh, they also have some seriously hot elves working for them behind the bar. I suggest sitting at the bar, if possible."
"Their sandwiches and potato salad are outstanding, their seafood salad, and their bread oh and desserts....and martinis :)I absolutely love that place!"
"This place is just wonderful!We go here when we want a nice cocktail time, everyone has their own little place. Good music, great ambiance. They have a very good selection of different kind of drinks too!If you want a cocktail place that is isnt the usual, definitely recommend this place!"
"**I'm not even vegan and I thought this place was great! The food was really good and the service was amazing!**Here's the story:We came here for our vegetarian friends birthday so I was a bit hesitant about the menu (being a meat eater). I ordered the Chikn bacon ranch sandwhich. I didnt necesarily expect it to taste like the real thing and it didn't. BUT it tasted very good! I would certainly go back. I wasn't a huge fan of the macaroni and cheze but the potstickers were delicious!Aside from the food our waiter was so nice! He was attentive but not annoying and he brought my friend a free dessert with a candle and everything. He didnt just do it becuase he was supposed to, you could tell he was really excited and happy to do it! I'm looking forward to going back and trying new things!"
"Um, well, they have some of the tastiest food in Andersonville, but I've heard some really terrible things about how they treat their wait staff. Like, really terrible discriminatory things. So, unfortunately, I won't be eating there anymore."
"I've been here four times now, and am a member of their party as well so I get to drink out of a mug instead of a pint (4 extra ounces!). The first time I went was on a Sunday afternoon, a somewhat rainy one at that. We chose this time as when we tried on the previous Friday the wait seemed fairly unreasonable (I think it was estimated at an hour and a half). My friend, a current Manhattan resident, and I ordered the house made sausages. All of them were absurdly tasty. We also got the duck confit pizza, which was also absurdly tasty. My friend declared it the best culinary experience I have had in months given that previously that weekend we had gone to XoCo and the Bad Apple that seemed like a fairly impressive task as both of those places have great food as well. On that first visit bet"
Impressive in all respects. ��Without a doubt the best service I have ever had in any dining establishment. ��The overall experience was amazing and will always be remembered. ��The food was very good but perhaps I fell prey to over-expectations as I don't typically frequent such amazing establishments very often. ��I am so glad we were able to get reservations.
"I've thought long and hard about what I could complain about and there is nothing! ��At most, I could say that the wait is long, but good things come to those that wait. ��I would be suspicious if the wait wasn't long. ��Actually, the wait wasn't that long, but would have seemed longer if the food sucked!Anyway, my wife and I have been on a breakfast spot search lately and this place was money. ��A friend recommended but I didn't let my wife know that because last time he recommended a horrible place. ��I'm all for second chances though and a good thing too.I had a countryside skillet. ��It was meatastic. ��They didn't have to put the country gravy on the side, but thank god that they did. ��My wife had the peach cobbler crepe. �� It was like having desert for breakfast and who doesn't like desert?"
"We went with a group of eight and they put us in the back room with all the waitstaff, who were folding napkins and going over the night's specials. They never brought us the snacks we ordered, messed up our bill and were generally rude. If you are out for Sunday Funday, wait until 7PM when they have their game faces on."
"Here I go food tripping again and now I chance upon this crazy place. I find that the service is unique and entertaining, definitely worth a visit though it may be pricey, They've got quite a mix of salads and a non-stop meat course after which you would like to try out their desserts if you have the time. They've got cheese , hot soups, but the wine service really grabbed my attention, I guess they took advantage of the high ceiling, their structure and their interest for these kind of gymnastics, you'd have to appreciate that.They've got a spacious seating area, very nice interior and nice lighting, nice ambiance, nice service. We ordered the portabello, artichokes with the bacon goat cheese terraine, spent some time at the cool salad bar. I'd come back if i have the time again. See you "
"Went to Superdawg on my recent trip to Chicago -- LOVE THIS PLACE -- it's consistently good and the service is excellent, love the drive-in set up. ��Really surprised by some of the reviews I've read here!! ��I've been going to this place for years and now that I no longer live in Chicago I make a point of visiting every time I'm in town. ��I had the hamburger this time and it was excellent but I love their dogs, too! ��Also, LOVE the fries. ��Overall, one of my favorite places!Note: ��They only take cash but there is an ATM there."
"Conveniently located across the street from my favorite gym, Wicker Park Fitness, I can grab a great cup of coffee before I go make myself bohemieth. Just kidding, I'm more into toning. Just be careful because all the great cakes that you see in the window can be dangerous to the gut but well worth it."
"This place is great. ��I there about once a week. ��The staff is soooo friendly, the food is amazing and patio in the summer is a perfect work getaway!"
"My dinner at Alinea was the single best meal of my life! ��Incredibly friendly and approachable waitstaff, and the food was mind-blowingly delicious. ��I went there to experience a new way of looking at food, and it certainly was. ��The black truffle explosion is a phenomenal dish. ��The food is fun and inventive; closed minds may not have much fun. ��Sure, it's quite pricey, but totally worth the experience! ��I will definitely be going back!"
"OPEN FORUM TO MANAGEMENT: I have been the biggest fan of Fox and Obel for so long! However I just ate there the other day and they changed the menu......HORRIBLE. I was looking forward to my tuna melt, which was so delicious in the past. But this one had chunks of corn, watery tomatoes, some herb aoli---it was horrible, it was like they didn't know what they wanted to taste like so they just put everything in it. My fiance had the lobster club which they also changed, he couldnt even eat it. He said it had way to many flavors and it was overwhelming. TO MANAGEMENT! don't change a good thing. I now can't think about this place without getting a little sick, so most likely I won't be returning. CHANGE THE MENU!"
"The first time I went here, I had the chicken piccata - I almost didn't go back - it was terrible (too much garlic). ��I am glad however that a friend talked me into going back. ��I like the BYOB aspect, it is never more than $30 pp with apps, entrees and desserts. ��I tend to stick with what I know here: ��homemade rigatoni with parm is always the special and unbelievable! ��The lasgna is GREAT too. ��They always 'act' like they are out of tarimisu - that excuse is old...they should just take it off the menu."
"The ambiance of this place really sets the stage for a relaxing experience. The liquor and wine lists are extensive and the menu is full of amazing comfort food options. Every time I've been here, I have loved the food. The fireplace and ""Library"" area are great options for smaller groups looking for a relaxed setting."
"wow, what a dinner, so many delicious items. ��The lobster mac and cheese was incredible as was the truffle gnocchi. ��The bone-in steaks which are their signature was also extremely well done. ��The chocolate sin cake was also one of the best desserts I have had in a while. ��This combined with a very strong wine selection makes for a very very nice dinner out. ��Only downside that I could really mention was that the piano singer from the bar area could be heard throughout the main dining room and he really should not have been singing at all. ��A great dining experience and although a little pricey, the quality of everything makes it extremely worth it."
Shaw's is always great. ��I have been coming here for years. ��The service is dependable and the food is amazing.
"I may be about as picky of a person as they come in terms of food choices. Having said that, I find it only fitting that I give this authentic mexican establishment five stars. It has that 'something' quality that makes me wanting to go back. I'll start with the pros:1. Out of this world Margaritas - hands down. Every time I come to this friendly ?neighborhood eatery and order a Margarita, I end up leaving loaded (even on just one). Mayan's Margaritas make others seem synthetic. Try the Patron - the next day, you'll be glad you did.2. Robust Salsa. Practically considering salsa a food staple, Mayan's salsa not only delivers on its freshly made taste - it definitely has some serious zing. Not to mention, the excellent servers refill your table's chips and salsa constantly. 3. Seating. As I "
"If boss lady is buying, I'm staying. But I wouldn't spend my own cashola here. Baked goods are hit-or-miss."
"The food here, is not that great. Just grading the food, I would give it 2 stars, but since it's open late-night, I give it 3."
"A friend recommended Sunda to my girlfriend and me a few weeks ago, and, given that we hadn't had a fancy dinner in a while, we decided to go.My first impression of the place was that both the dining room and bar were very well done. ��It is certainly a modern, stylish place, but not to the extent that it feels cold or unromantic at all. ��Additionally, the service staff at the front of the restaurant was incredibly welcoming.Unable to pick just a few items from the menu, we wound up getting cocktails, three appetizers, two main courses, and a dessert between the two of us. ��The cocktails were solid, but the food was delicious. ��In particular, the duck/daikon/egg salad appetizer was incredible. ��It had very strong Asian flavors, but it was not overdone at all. ��The duck (and there was an inc"

"Simply It is simply my favorite restaurant in Chicago. ��After living in Seattle for a couple of years, I became addicted to pho ga, and haven't been able to find a consistently excellent bowl since I left -- even while I was living in NYC! ��Now, at long last, I have found that bowl, and let me tell you, it couldn't be more deeply appreciated. ��Nothing cheers you up, warms you up, and sooths the soul like a bowl of that pho ga. ��It also helps that the entire staff is delightfully friendly and welcoming, and that they will deliver pretty much anywhere in Chicago. ��My boyfriend and I go here at least once a week and have become regulars. ��We've tried several things on the menu by now -- the fresh shrimp spring rolls, the clay pot chicken, the spicy chicken salad, etc ... all delicious. ��I rea"
"I was very excited to eat at Frontera Grill, but I thought the food and service fell short. ��I knew going there that we would have to wait a couple hours, but I thought that the food would be far worth the wait. ��Not so much. ��We started out with the Ceviche Yucateca, which contained shrimp and calamari. ��The shrimp was mushy and fishy - I couldn't eat it. ��I ordered the Falda Asada Brava for my main course, which was ok - but I have had better. ��Our waitress never came back to see how we were doing or to ask if our food was good. ��After we had finished our meals, a member of the waitstaff came to clear our dishes. ��Mind you - I had more than half of my dish leftover, so I thought he was going to box it up. ��But instead, he piled all of the dishes on top of the food I wanted to take home a"
"If I was basing the review on the food and beer alone it would be 5 stars, but due to the service I had to knock it down a star, maybe even two. ?I have been going to piece for over two years and they must have an extremely high turnover rate because I have never had the same server twice and sometime the service is excellent, other times it is horrible. ?Take this Sunday for instance. ?Our pizza came out burnt on the edges. ?We were a little upset because we love the crust, and it being charred and all was not something that we enjoy. ?When we mentioned it to the server, he responded It looks perfect to me ?Well, sir you need new glasses, because burnt crust is not acceptable in my book. ?I glanced at other tables to see if their pizza crust was burnt, and it was not, so either we were lu"
"We went after seeing it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives which can sometimes be a ��gamble but this one paid off. ��We enjoyed the environment, service, and food. ��The shrimp & oyster po-boy was amazing and I don't even like seafood. ��My 12yo ordered it and I had the pot pie, mine was good but I wanted to take his after I tried it. ��My husband and other son had the chicken sandwich and the monte cristo, all delicious. ��We also tried the BBQ pulled pork nachos which were very good although my husband felt some of the chips weren't crispy enough, I loved it! ��I am looking forward to going back soon."
"I love the Green Mill. ��When I go, I usually frequent it on Monday nights when they usually have the Patricia Barber Quartet performing. ��In fact, this review is mostly about Monday nights with said performers.The atmosphere is great. ��The waitstaff are attentive, professional, and respect the performers as do the audience.If you have not yet been on Monday nights to see the Patricia Barber Quartet, I highly advise you do. ��Check the calendar on the website to confirm said group is not touring abroad however. ��What else to say? The music is organic, sultry, sensuous, real and imagined, and the sound quality is top-notch.If you are looking for a semi-intimate and somewhat romantic getaway on Monday night, look no further. ��It will change your mind."
"If we are in the mood for a burger and a beer, we head to The Bad Apple. Their burgers are some of the best we've had in the city. ��There is something special about the flavor of those burgers that keeps reeling us in! The fried cheese curds are the perfect appetizer, creamy and delicious!Love the beer and cider selection (I'm a Crispin cider fan)! Great place for lunch order dinner!We feel very lucky it's only a block away!Kristen B."
"I've been going to Nuevo Leon since college days, oh, about 3o years ago! ��It's different. ��They've added a very modern west-wing and the small diner-like original east wing, IMHO, is still the best seat in the house.I've had EVERYTHING on the menu, but what I'm sweet on are the Alhambres (a skewer of marinated skirt steak, green peppe ��I r, and onions) grilled and a few char specks, with steak that is tender, moist and juicy. ��It comes on a large platter with Spanish rice and beans, some guacamole and a few corn tortilla chips embedded in the refried beans.About the only thing missing here, is seafood.I love, love, love their coffee and have it with my Mexican shish-ka-bob (Alhambres) platter. However, not one of my friends that I have taken to Nuevo Leon agrees with me. ��Perhaps I simply"
"Love a great gastropubs, so I finally went to check out this place, based on all of the amazing reviews, and was immensely disappointed.The food was just OK, nothing that I was drooling over or wishing that I could have more of (and the portions are small). We got the:the meatballs and polenta (probably the best of anything)green salad - very salty and boringgoat sausage - tasty, but the flavor combos were strangepretzel and cheese - alright, but just a standard bar dishsweatbread - the meat was weird and fatty/fluffy By far the best part of our dinner was the drinks... good selection of beers and cocktail/whisky. Overall, would not go back for the food or go out of my way for the drinks. Got seated right away on a Saturday at about 5:30 so that was good.. and the tab was about $100 for ��2"
"I have been to Zed just a few times but generally only for drinks after work. As anyone that has had Brazilian Style before, cautiously, I have almost avoided the main courses in the main dining area. Well, let me tell you, aside from great smaller orders/desserts ordered from the bar, I love the decor and style of the venue, and after tasting the Harvest Bar, I must rave about it! They have always had friendly staff and are not pretentious like some of the rooftop scenes can be Downtown Chicago. Perfect for after work or a meeting; sometimes I've heard it can get crowded but I have never had a problem. If you are Hungry...try the Harvest Bar....bring a doggie bag because they will have to Roll you out of here!"
"I was here Friday with a friend because of GE's reputation as a quality place at a reasonable price. ��I'd have to say it didn't exceed or underperform my expectations, but met them. ��The music was louder than I expected. ��I know GE billed itself as fine dining but without the haughtiness, but I thought the music was a bit too loud as I felt I needed to speak loudly so my table partner could hear me. ��However, I did enjoy the atmosphere and the lack of tablecloth was nice for such a place. ��The waiter tried to sell me way too hard on buying their specialty drinks, as I must have turned him down 3 or 4 times. ��Sometimes a man just wants a Coke, mmkay? ��Popcorn was brought out before the entree and I found it to be quite good. ��The popcorn flavor rotates and we were given the ranch style. ��Ca"
"Went there for a large party and the room and service were great. ��Our server could not have been more accomodating or helpful. ��The hostess staff were the worst, however. ��I love when you walk up to the first person who is the face of the restaurant and none of the three women are remotely helpful or concerned. ��Glad our server made up for them.The apps were great as was the white wine (Albarino). ��The paella was just ok. ��The place has a fun atmosphere and good crowd."
"You can't speak about Greek food without mentioning this wonderful classic. ��It is fun to go to..lots of rooms (you think you are in another world), paintings on walls are fun to see. ��Bar is supurb. ��Gyros are the best in the city...and they are home-made. ��Most places buy from the one or two vendors around. �� Fish is great and fresh. ��Waiters are a delight. ��It is like being at a carnivale. ��Tarmasalata is yummy. ��We always take an order home...call it Greek Lox and bread."
"OK - This was for delivery - I have never been to the restaurant - so maybe a great martini would make it 2 stars. ��I thought the food was pretty bad. ��The ribs were dry, cold and nothing to shout about. ��We only ate 1/2 and the rest were tossed. ��Chicken Marsala - awful - chicken breasts in some broth, no flavor. ��Pizza - it was ok - again - nothing great. ��I am used to good food and eat out quite often. ��I used to order delivery a lot until I moved far north - I can't find any great restaurants with delivery up here! ��And the guy that delivered it gave us attitude because he had to come up the stairs. ��Hey! ��that's why I'm paying a delivery fee and tipping you - to bring it to my door!!I definitely won't order delivery from here again."
"I cannot understand how anyone can praise this place. Friends from out of town wanted to go here for dinner and drinks. We went and had the worst time ever. The owner was so pushy and in your face every five minutes that I was getting sick of seeing him. What a major blowhard. It is one thing to brag about food if it is good, another to brag over lousy over cooked and salt laden mush. Yelpers have raved about the stuffed cabbage and the polenta so I tried them both. Huge error on my part. Tasteless boiled to death cabbage and overly salty polenta. Our friends had the goulash and said it was just okay, nothing to write home about or ever order again. In fact they felt the food was not worth the price we paid. If you love blowhards with heavy accents and lousy food, this is the place for you"
"Love, love, love the food here. ��I've always wanted to try Ethiopian food and I'm glad I did. ��The tangy bread, sambussas, and platters to share were excellent.Service was good and they were helpful at explaining what the different items on the menu were. The only thing I didn't care for was the dessert, way too sweet!"
"Was in the mood for seafood last weekend and decided to go to Shaws with some friends. ��Not impressed with the food for the price. ��Don;t get me wrong, it was good food, but $50 for one lb of crab is a little steepm considering its mostly shell."
"I enjoy the pho they serve here. The service is really fast. It gets really pack and busy when I went at night and in the morning. It is especially jam packed at night, so go a little earlier. Sometimes it gets hard to find parking as well so you would have to park pretty far, but I think its worth it. Portions are perfect for me and they have great service. I also had a drink there, however I did not like it so much because it was a little too sweet for me. For those we likes sweet, then it would be perfect/ ��Pricing is fair, food is yummy, and great service."
Shortly after posting my initial review. I received a response from the owners. The site now indicates the $15 minimum order at the start. I was impressed with the customer service of the follow up. Don't always find that. I ordered the pizza last night and it was as good as my friends had stated. I love thin crust pizza and this is amongst the best. Great pizza and customer service. Will be back for more.

"I have been to this place three times and I think the chef is unique in what he does. ��His Pan Asian dishes are exceptional, the ambiance ��is great, the service very helpful. ��Try the lemongrass beef lollipops and the oxtail dumplings."
"This is a great place to get lunch, since my work is only a couple of blocks away. ��My apartment is unfortunately just outside of their delivery area, or I might eat at Indie all the time. ��I really enjoy the Chicken Teriyaki or Salmon Teriyaki bento box, as it is very filling (comes with salad, miso soup, and california rolls). ��In addition, I'm a big fan of the panang curry. ��Granted, it is probably not the most authentic, but it is amongst the most delicious I have had. ��Specifically, I really like the choice of veggies. ��Cabbage, carrots, peas, and broccoli, rather than just peppers like many other places. ��The panang curry is rather more soupy than others I've had before, but it is nonetheless delicious and flavorful.Although I usually have it delivered, I've also dined in on occasion"
"I am not one to review a place without actually eating there first, but my experience with Schwa was so disappointing and frankly upsetting that I had to warn others, just in case. ?I had a reservation made about a month in advance, and celebrated the fact I got through on the phone! ?We were celebrating my friend's birthday, and had people come to town just for that evening. ?About 2 hours before my reservation I received a call that Schwa would not be open that evening due to sewage and plumbing issues. ?The person telling me this was being quite condescending, saying things like I guess you could come in...but I wouldn't want you smelling like sh** ?I told them I understood but was so upset.This would not be such a big deal if I did not go on twitter hours later and read various people'"
Truley amazing from decore to food! the staff is attentive knowlegable and extremly efficent. the food is beond what I expected. the Chef and sous Chef ��came out and greeted our group I found this really nice in a day when most people don't seem to care. If you want a great dinning expiriance this is the place
"I've been there four times now and im quite fond of their burgers!My favorite so far is the lockdown warden but havent been dissapointed in any of my choices. The first time i went there the fries were kinda soggy but they definatelly fixed that problem. However last time i went there they were playing some dubstep music and i dont know how that fits in to their metal/jail theme? i asked the bartender if he could play something else, he said if i dont like it i can leave. The attitude was totaly uncalled for. Next time i'll just get my food delivered."
One of my favorite restaurants! It's perfect!
"Alliance Bakery is great. I haven't got to try a huge selection of all the treats yet. The cupcakes are tasty and cute, which in my opinion makes them taste better. And I've had their chocolate rasberry cake. wow. I always get iced coffee when I go there. I'm not sure what they brew but it's delicous.Then I sit next door and take part in the free wireless. Everyone who works there is so nice."
best sushi in lakeview.
"This place is right down the block from me, and I remember one of my roommates RAVING about this place as soon as we moved in this past summer. Granted, it took me a surprisingly long time to meander down there myself...like, four months. Haaa. (So I'm a little slow...)It's a great place for breakfast or brunch! There are so many things to choose from for breakfast that it made our heads spin.The portions are huge! ��The prices are great . The waitress checked up on us several times. Simply Great place ! Thanks"
"First time at Xoco and it surpassed my expectations. We ordered the barbacoa goat torta, pork belly caldo and hibiscus tea. The food was great. The pork belly soup was amazing with an insane depth of flavor. Most impressive was the customer service. Two minutes after sitting down, Alyssa, the chef came over to let us know that she was just starting a new batch of fideos for the soup and we could wait 10 minutes or she could bring it over without the fideos. We opted to just wait and relax. Five minutes later Alyssa was back with an order of chips, salsa and guacamole on the house to thank us for waiting. A few minutes later a waitress brought over two side salads on the house. Our food arrived a few minutes later and was amazing! Thanks for the great food and wonderful service."
Not the best hot dog in Chicago but definitely up there. ��The fries are awesome and Superdawg has one of the best shakes in the business. ��I wish my diet let me eat here more!
"My girlfriend and i came in on a saturday night probably around 7. We didnt have reservations and we waited for 45ish minutes (which was fine, we expected that, it was packed!) we got a nice window seat and our waiter was wonderful, very friendly and very funny! The salad bar was my favorite and the meats were delicious! The only negative thing i would have to say about my experience is that the owner who visited us at the table was very annoying. He kept pushing us for more of the side dishes and was just way too aggressive. I think from now on he should let his staff do all the work because he is not a good people person! Other than that, i would definitely come back, only i would make reservations!"
"This is my favorite Pho restaurant in Chicago! And I LOOOOOVE Pho! Tank is always super busy on the weekends so try to come during the week. Oh and be ready to share a table and eat with strangers if you have a small party. What I love the most about Tank is it's no fuss and FAST. I always get the #39 bowl of Pho, a marinated pork sandwich, and either the fresh shrimp spring rolls or fried shrimp egg rolls. This place is consistent and the broth always tastes the same. (I hate when other Pho restaurants taste differently depending on what time you get there). Tank isn't the cleanest of all restaurants, and sometimes you'll even get a thumb in your soup, but we all joke that that's where the flavor comes from. =) Bring your own beer and wear something casual because you will smell afterward"
"Awesome. ��Service is always stellar the atmosphere is always hopping with a trendy crowd and the best part is the food. ��Very good with a large variety. ��Good for groups, good for a date or just a place to have a cocktail."
"Hands-down our favorite place to order pizza. ��The wait is long but totally worth it. Every time we have friends in town, we order from here."
"There is nothing I can write about my 3 experiences that has not already been covered. ��This place is a gem, and every single item I have ordered has blown my mind and my taste buds."
"This is a great restaurant if you are looking for something different. The steaks are as good as any other all you can eat steak house, but the sides and appetizers are unique and delicious. This restaurant might possibly have the best atmosphere of any restaurant I have ever been to. The lighting was a little dark, but there was a big open fire in the middle of the restaurant."
"Great Beer Selection.My friends in Chicago wanted me to discover the premier gastropub of the windy city.I get lost in their beer menu, I honestly think they have too many!Just my opinion.Pro & ConsLets start with the cons, too noisy, very loud! The waitress seem to be in pain!Our table! they stuck us on the second level in a corner, my 2 friend were Little embarrassed by our seating arrangement.The pros, the polenta was to die for, the mac and cheese was pretty good with just the right crust.Great beers, we sampled 3, I don't remember the names.Overall, good place, Chicago have room to improve on gastropubs"
"I won't be going back here ever again. The food is ok, but my biggest complaint is the rude staff that seems to have this perpetual look of disgust on their faces EVERY time I stand in that dumb line to take my order. The prices are a little high, but if my presence is such an inconvenience, why bother? That being said, there was 1 girl that didn't have the sour puss face (tall, skinny, died black hair) was always smiling and pleasant, though haven't seen her in a while. Perhaps she got canned for having a nice personality? The petite girl, brown hair, pretty at the register...the WORST! My friend commented on her as well, so I know it's not just me. Go someplace else where they appreciate your business."
If you are looking for a truely cozy place to go then you have to check out Wilde! Upon entering the restaurant you notice the beautiful wood decor with a library nestled between two beautiful bars. You get an upscale feeling the moment you walk in. The service is grate our food was hot and delicious. You certanly get high quality and value when you dine there. ��They have a very nice patio for those beautiful summer nights which fills up quickly. I SAY GO!
"I went to India house for my folks party yesterday.. One of the best if not the best indian food in downtown chicago area.. My only complaint is that the martini's were average and they could have more beer options.. Said that, The food was fantastic and so was the orange and mango kulfi.. I will be going back for the buffet soon and will update my review soon.. Go for dinner to India House.. You won't regret it..."
"The food was Americanized. ��WE got Family Style---What a joke. ��Childsize portions and way overpriced. ��Rude waiter, and above all it was for my birthday. ��They ran out of lamb and white meat chicken after one helping. ��I would go to any other restaurant out of the 1,000s in Greektown above this place anyday. ��Choose another restaurant!!!"
"What a great place to eat!The food is delicious! ��Flavorful, fresh, and excellently prepared. ��Everything coming out of the kitchen looked appetizing, and I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness and complexity in the flavors of the food. ��This is not your average Asian restaurant with questionable meats slathered in an overly sweet sauce. ��Ingredients are thoughtfully combined to create flavor, texture, and depth in every dish. ��The mango beef was amazing -- the beef succulent, the veggies cooked with just the right amount of fresh crunch, and served in a coconut! ��Speaking of coconuts, the coconut ice cream for desert was also a major winner -- light and sweet; a perfect end to a wonderful meal.On top of the awesome food, the service is truly spectacular. ��Friendly staff and an insane"
"Hi this my first ever yelp! Okay I was really exited about going to Graham Elliot's and I was a little disappointed based on the other reviews. I thought I was in for the time of my life and it was - eh. The white truffle popcorn is good, but not a ""first time ever creation"". I've had this a few times - it's also called Parmesan & Garlic popcorn. I also had the risotto with the cheezits and it wasn't creamy based as I would have liked, it ran a little on the thick side. ��For this kind of meal I would not expect to pay $80.00 a person. ��Good: I did have the scallops which were tasty. Also they do have a nice variety of beverage parings. I thought the portions were fine."
"Went on a Saturday night and didn't have to wait a minute. The place is big, with a simple but nice atmosphere (lots of exposed brick)- we got a table on the back patio. The menu contains delights from both Mexican and Cuban influence. The food is excellent and the portions hearty. I had the Cuban Style Chicken, which was great and the plantains were delicious. The Jalepeno Mashed Potatoes are equally as amazing.Can't wait to go back and try some more Cuban dishes (and more plantains!) I will be coming back, and in greater numbers."
"1st dinner date with my future husband. ��WOW....how do you out do this place? ��Oh, go again. ��:) ��It was very very good, but I thought it was overpriced. ��Was I supposed to notice? ��We had the scallops as an appetizer, a first for him. ��Unbelievably delicious. ��He had crab and I had tuna. ��Both were wonderful and I believe I can easily say that neither of us thought we had enough. ��He ordered raspberry pie for dessert. ��I ate the vanilla ice cream off the top as I don't enjoy the seeds from the berries, but he said it was very good. ��4 stars"
"A meat lover's MUST!The best part about the restaurant is that the servers prepare the meat themselves and if you frequent it enough, as in my case, they learn what you like and prepare the way YOU like it ... again, if you frequent it often enough :)The lamb chops are my favorite!!!"
hi this is deepak.this products is exellent
"Wow, heard about restaurant week and called to inquire to make sure it was going on. Yes, $33 including a dessert and best of all: No reduced portions as most restaurants do! Of course you needed to mention it to get it!!! Best deal and food in town! Can't wait to be back!"
"Not only did this food take me back to the bayou, we had a great server. ��What more can I say about this place?"
"Ok, the honest truth is that if I had a last meal, this would be it...I love this place. ?Best pizza in the city and I love bringing out of towners to this place as my little discovery...even though its hard to keep a lid on it these days as they are totally getting the recognition they deserve lately. ?I love the good beer on tap and friendly atmosphere. ?Please don't go here though-I don't want to wait so long for a table!"
"Another must see in Chi-town! ��The food is so good and if you are there in the summer, they have the cutest outdoor patio.If the wait is long - just hang in there - so worth it! ��Also, being from CA I am spoiled when it comes to fresh fish...Mia has got it covered! ��I had the skatewing and it was PHA - NOMINAL.What are you waiting for - Go Go Go!"
WOW!
Absolutely incredible. ��Two friends of mine and I stayed there for 5 hours. ��All of their 10-12 meats were incredible. �� A stylish atmospere keeps you entertained. ��The outside rooftop patio is one of the best in the city.
"We made reservations...good idea. ��They were very accomodating and it was pretty busy on Friday evening. ��We got there and sat down immediately. ��I read some of the other reviews...to be honest...i didnt even see pizza on the menu, i went right to the entrees and had the lasagna bolonese...delicious. ��Another of our party had the carbonara...also great. ��Prices were very moderate. ��Sadly we were not staying longer in Chicago or we would have taken the leftovers with us. ��We will definitely have to go back when in Chicago again."
"After reading the reviews online my roommate and I decided to check this place out even though it had a few bad reviews mixed in there.I'm so glad we did! This place was great. My roommate and I agreed that it is one of the best we've been for Mexican in the city so far. Very sizable portions and reasonably priced too! We both ate for under 15 dollars total with a sack of leftovers to take home! My food was not greasy at all and my roommate really seemed to enjoy her food as well. The service was ok too, no problems there. I think the chips and salsa were great, chips were hot and fresh. And the salsa was really good and not too spicy.There is no doubt I will be back and next time I will try one of their Margaritas! Ole!"
"Went for dinner on a Friday night and found it to be highly over rated. ��I've heard raving reviews but not sure why. ��The food was ok, but used fancy descriptions to make it sound better than it tastes. ��I tried the pork belly and it was all fat. ��It was more like glorified carnitas at 10x the price. ��My wife ordered the pasta and found it very pedestrian."
"Blackened Chicken is my dish here. Everything about the restaurant is just very good. The atmosphere, the food, the service, it all rocks. They even offer a 15% discount to people who bike there. There are three specific things that knock it down from 5 to 4 stars. 1. If you are going to want anything after they bring you your food (like ketchup) you have to really wave them down. They get busy and are continuously running around. 2. There is an odd break between lunch and dinner at 3-5pm on weekdays. If you forget about it and decide to eat a late lunch/early dinner you'd be disappointed. 3. Their full menu isn't served on weekends (I can't get my blackened chicken)."
My friend took me there after helping him move in the building above. I had no idea what to expect. WOW. Al the meat I could eat and more. ��The meat was the best I have ever had. ��A glass of wine and my friend picked up the bill. CAN'T beat that. ��I need to go again during the lunch special.
"Chicago Scene named this place the best neighborhood bar for a reason...there's nothing to hate! I've been everywhere on Division and this place never disappoints. Everything from the service, to the food and drinks and the atmosphere, I can't complain.I try to come here as often as I can just because of the food. The burgers are amazing and you should get yours with a fried egg because that's an option here. The nachos are so good, and their gaucamole is very flavorful. The skirt steak sandwich on garlic bread makes my mouth water. I like what someone said about the cheese fries..just do it...don't even think about it!!Right now they are serving drinks in these plastic red cups which you can take home. Their draft beer selection is kind of weak, but I do enjoy my 312 so I'm happy to get t"
"I had a steak burger, and it did taste delicious. However the price is a bit expensive for what I ordered. But then again, the burger was the size of my face."
"It's worth wait!! We love their small plates and pasta. ��Not a big fan of the pizza, a little underdone. ��The wine selection is great and pricing is reasonable. ��A great Italian gem on Taylor Street."
"The food was OK, but the wait for delivery was WAY too long. Also, the portions were incredibly skimpy. I was shocked at how little i received for the amount I paid. The food was lukewarm. ��After opening the bag, I wished I had left less of a tip than I had, because the food was so meh."
These guys are the real deal! Sandwiches are the killer and can't go wrong with any one of them. I do want to try their coffee one of these days also.
Overrated I've had better
"This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. We went on a Friday evening and it was not very busy at all. There was staff standing around talking, and yet it was very difficult to get any service. We wanted the honey wine and were told that it was no longer offered with the coupon deal we bought. When we asked for help in selecting items, we were directed to read the menu, which was fairly vague in description (we wanted more description on the sauces that were used on the meats). Our fried appetizer came out still cold in the middle, and the entree portion of the meal was barely above room temperature. When we asked the server she simply replied it's supposed to be that way. Since all of the items we ordered were meat, health safety-wise I would guess that it should have "
"This is my spot for Vegan dining. ��The food is excellent, the crowd is very eclectic and the staff is really nice and friendly. ��Their satan dishes are amazing!!!"
"My favorite restaurant in Chicago, maybe anywhere. Rick is often in the house, and it shows in the attention to detail, stellar ever-evolving menu, and fantastic service. The drinks are seasonal and so great. Highly recommended, along with its higher-class sister, Topolobampo."
Had a wonderful meal last evening. We went there dispite the bad reviews andw ee not disappointed. I had the fillet mignon while my wife had a homemade pasta. We were both delighted. The wine selection is good and so was the service.
Had Gino's East deep dish sausage the other night for the first time in at least 20 years. It was as good as I remembered it.
"I come here everytime I come back to the chi to visit my parents, Alinea is PERFECT! The service is impecable, the wines are amazing, the hamachi is my absolute favorite dish, and the chocolate mousse is to die for! The full bar is a plus! The interior is fantastic, there is nothing negative I could say, it's perfect!"
After seeing so many positive reviews I decided to try this place. I can honestly say I can make better food at home. This place was a total let down.
"Friends who live in Andersonville suggested Hopleaf on one of my first trips to Chicago, and I must say, I was not disappointed -- except for the service. ?Being an east coaster, I'm lucky to be surrounded by the likes of Monk's and The Abbey (Philly), as well as Max's Taphouse (Baltimore), where 200-300 beers and dozens of good Belgians are the norm. ?I'm reasonably well-versed in beer styles and brewing methods, so when I go to a place with a great beer selection like Hopleaf and say to the bartender, Hi there. ?Do you have any good dubbels on tap that you would recommend?, I don't expect to be greeted by rolling eyes, a slight sigh, and a moribund Just look at the beer menu and tell me what you want. ?Sadly, such was the vortex of discourtesy that surrounded the middle-aged, blond-ish f"
"I guess there is nothing novel about recommending the mussels, but there is no shame in being one of 411 people to say they are superb. ��Otherwise, I haven't had a bad bite at Hopleaf. ��Hype worthy. ��Just don't contemplate not ordering water and no beer on a Monday - the waiter might respond - so, you do realize that you're at Hopleaf, right? ��Hey waiter guy - I can order dank beer lots of places. ��While I love your beer selection and respect it's elite nature, the food is what sells me on Hopleaf."
"Good food, fair price. Have never been disappointed!"
Excellent! Naan was vey good as were the main entrees. The servers were excellent!
"I LOVE Coast! ��My husband and I have regular date nights at Coast, and I'm never disappointed. The service is consistently great, the sushi is consistently great, the atmosphere is good (maybe a little loud though, since they thend to stay packed), and we can bring in a bottle of wine. Perfect!My faves on the menu: the hamachi carpaccio, sashimi platters, spicy miso, and spicy creamy. Everything I've had there is really, really good though."
"Food was excellent and our server -- Bryce -- was professional, friendly, and very, very helpful. ��We had a large and somewhat demanding group for dinner, and really appreciated the flexibility and attentiveness from the kitchen and staff."
"Uh...pretty freakin' tasty BBQ! Full disclosure, my office went for lunch before this place officially opened, for a 'friends and neighbors tasting', which basically meant we got to eat anything off the menu for free...and we got a tour of the restaurant and kitchen...and Lee Ann Whippen (of Throwdown with Bobby Flay and TLC's Pitmasters fame) was actually there.That bias aside, the food was awesome. About as authenitc BBQ as you can get for being an upscale restaurant in the Gold Coast. The guy who works the smoker told me they use 4 different kinds of wood (hickory, cherry, maple, and maple...I think) to smoke the meat. The baby back ribs were super flavorful, and the pulled pork is so juicy and tender. They have 3 different sauces (two tomato-based, one vinegar) which are great. Onion r"
"Great efficient service. PiJiu Ya (Beer Duck), Kou Shui Ji (Chicken)Yi ping hong (the fish) ��and the house specialty beef are all awesome."
Very tasty and always fresh. ��Menu is on-line which is very helpful. ��Great for take-out.
come hungry. prepare to wait if you dont have a reservation. dont complain. they are worth the wait.
"RESERVATIONS? ��The people that say that they waited ""several times"" after making a reservation are wrong. They do not even take reservations, so that's false. ��The beignets are heavenly. ��So is the miso salmon. ��You really can't make a bad choice. ��This is great comfort food."
Great cookies...
the real deal! ��period!check it!!!!
"Excellent Excellent. If you are looking for a very fine dining experience and dont care to spare the cash, this is your place. The ingredients are top notch and the meats is seasoned to perfections. If your going with a group and you are not a meat eater, the salad bar is top quality selections better than the other Brazilian steak houses and I have tried others."
HOT DOUG's GAVE ME FOOD POISONING.Went to Hot Doug's with two friends. We all got different Dogs/Sausages and shared a basket of the Duck Fat fries. My friend called me the next night to see if I was sick. I missed her call because I was in the bathroom vomiting. ��All three of us got sick. ��I will not be returning.
I like this place but I'm not sure how soon I will be back. The first time I went there one guy next to my ��table got splashed with hot oil while dipping his piece in his fondue. It was kind of scary.
"Yes, The pizza slices are priced right and ok, But the food here is godawfull, Not really worth it unless everything else is closed, Not sure how this was voted best Pizza in Chicago, Maybe best cheap Pizza, I'ts similar to a decent bowling alley Pizza."
I live for this place. As much as a man can live for his neighborhood mexican restaurant.
love this restaurant. cannot go wrong by dining here. it's a little pricey but if want to have night on the town i would pick this restaurant.
"Well worth the above normal prices considering you don't have to go all the way to Devon St to get excellent authentic Indian Food. The quality and selection of the lunch buffet is by the far the best I've ever seen short of the Indian Restaurants in London. From mini-samosas to chicken tikka masala, there is something for everyone...and surprisingly, a large selection of vegetarian entrees as well.I have not yet had dinner here, but it is one of my favorite spots for lunch...."
"EXCEPTIONAL IN EVERY WAY.DO EXPECT: Impeccable, formal service; Outstanding, original cuisine; Excellent options for vegetarians (including the tasting menu); Staff who are passionate about food and wine; Great suggestions for wine-pairings; To be surrounded by beautiful art (on your way to/from the bathroom, ask a staff member for a little guided-tour of the art pieces); A stool for your handbag(!).DON'T EXPECT: A cheap evening; Ultra-friendly servers (unless you're seated at the kitchen table, where the experience does feel more relaxed, but no less wonderful)."
"Wishbone is really awesome. Great food, friendly staff, beautiful and colorful space, really excellent coffee, and simply a cheery place to be. A friend of mine hosted her birthday party and we had our New Years Eve there. It was great. Really appreciate them being in the neighborhood."
"I had a great dinning experience here. I went here with my husband, since we couldn't decide what to order we settled on the chef's selection. Every course was absolutely delicious. I would say the place was about 50% full that night. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. The only downside is that it is quite pricey. I can't wait to go back!"
Wonderful neighborhood Mexican joint..FANTASTIC service. MONEY Margaritas (and they come in pitchers too!). ��Had the combo fajitas here and they were really good. ��Guacamole and Salsa are good too!
"I went to dine at Sprout with my wife and another couple. my wife and i both like food and know of dale from the top chef show, and wanted to give it a try. we went in on a thursday and dined in this really beautiful stone and wood room. Our server came over immediately and asked if we had been here before, we hadn't, so he easily and simply explained that it is a $65 ��three course prie fix or order a la carte. With the three course meal you also get a small soup and cheese course too. We went with the prie fix, and what a deal. large portions, great combonations of flavors, and the cheese course was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches i have every had. The staff was knowledgeable and pleasant. and the cocktails were absolutely delicious. we'll be going back really soon!"
MMMMMMMMM plantains! MMMMM MMMM GOOD! MMMMMMMMM shakes! MMMMMMMMMMMMMM Potato Tacos!!! MMMMMMMMM So Good!!!
"Great, great food as everyone has already noted. ?But I am not going to pander to masses on the quality of service. ?My rating of two stars is relative to my expectations on the overall experiece (food, service, atmosphere, feeling during meal) and cost. ?Clearly it is an amazing restaurant but from my perspective it did not live up to the accolades.The bottom line is the service was just not up to par. ?The staff was very rigid and made me uncomfortable from the minute I sat down. The wine steward actually insulted me when I made a joke about desert wine not being Chateau d'yquem ( he said that some people only look from brands... - even if true that was a serious b-slap to a customer). ?In the end the Chef came out and prepared our desert (which was amazing) but barely said a word - zero"
This Pho place is Good. You can make better at home. If you can't make it. This is the place to go that is conveniently located in the corner across from Ba Le French Sandwich. This place should play more Quang Le music.Better than all the pho places. I still have to go to lily.Bun Dac Biet is my favorite. They do a good job.
"I signed up for Yelp just to leave this place a good review. ��I knew it would be a wait and was prepared; although, I was hungry and tempted to go. For a Fri night around 8 it was a 45 minute wait. ��There was a little mix up with the tables, but the hostess was extremely nice about it and the owner came out and opened a bottle of champagne for us. We were re-seated not more than five minutes later and still were seated before our estimated time.The service was prompt. The waiter took his time to explain dishes and answer questions. He was both knowledgeable, honest, and patient. I appreciated the fact that the owner seemed so involved. ��He was out talking to the guest waiting, seated, and continually checking in on the kitchen. He made personal recommendations for dishes and had the hostes"
"One of my favorite pizza places. Micro-brewed beers are awesome, I wish their better ones were available for growler fill ups. The wait would be doable if the bar area was larger or had a better flow. Service can be hit or miss. Usually the ladies that work there are on the ball. The wanna be hipster guys working there need to wake up before they come into work."
"this was the first restaurant I went to my first time visiting Chicago. All my friend ever talked about was how good Chicago-style (deep dish) pizza was, and coming from the NYC area...I HAD to try it. Needless to say, I loved it, the restaurant was great, I only gave it 4 stars just because it took so long (it was busy)."
Nuevo Leon is the closest to your mothers authentic mexican food you will get to! their tortillas are always fresh and warm. I have been to many Mexican restaurants across the nation and in mexico and being Mexican I have to say Nuevo Leon is always consistant and good!
Five star for the value. Lunch was good and portions were generous. Service was great - very attentive staff. Decor would improve 100% by removing the banner nailed to the wall above the black and white pictures.
"I had a chance to visit the cold Windy City in October 2011. ��I asked what is to try out here, and everybody said Giordano's. ��I was told to try the pizza however I opted to have the Italian Beef sandwich instead with the Antipasto salad. ��Excellent. ��Very tasty food and the service was very good too. ��Met some other people there that was also their first time eating at Giordano's. ��Great vibe environment. ��I had planned to come back and try the pizza there the next day. ��Too bad I had to travel out of Chicago unexpectedly the next morning. ��Maybe next time. ��Now that I think of it more, the Italian Beef was so good that there is a big chance that I will choose it again before trying the pizza in the future :-P"
Amazing thin crust pizza!Fantastic beer selection. In the heart of Wicker Park. Can't ask for much more.
"This place was great when it first opened up. However, it has suffered both in the quality of the Sushi and the service. It is sad that after living in Edgewater for over 20 years, a quality Asian restaurant opened up and fell from grace so soon. First off, I can thank Indie Cafe for the fact that I will never order any type of Sushi with crab meat ever again. Secondly, every time that I've ordered carry-out in the last 6 months they have screwed it up. Rather than correct their consistent screw-ups, Indie Cafe offers me ""$2.00 off of my next order."" As if!!!!!!!!!!!! When it comes to dining in, they screw things up as simple as the order the food should be brought. Since when are appetizers served after the main course?!? And when it comes to the maki rolls, their menu ingredients don't n"
"This restaurant is probably one of the best family restaurants in the area it is in. Appearance is nice, friendly staff, excellent food, and the owner is curteous and cares about his customers!!"
"It was hard to find parking and when you do find it, parking is expensive. Also, it was by the corner and the sun hit directly on there so all the curtains are usually closed. ��The drinks were a bit overpriced, in my opinion. When we asked for extra noodles, the amount seemed normal. However, the food portions are decent and the pho broth was a bit better than average.The best thing about it is the staff is extremely friendly though."
"This is the second I've been here. ��While the first time was great, the second time was phenomenal!! ��First time, I ordered a la carte. ��This time, I ordered the tasting menu, which was incredible!! ��The truffle popcorn was fantastic and you won't find anything like it anywhere else. ��The tasting menu consisted of the caesar, a corn bisque, halibut w/ mushrooms and asparagus, waygu beef w/ fingerlings and desssert that had chocolate. ��My favorites were the halibut and the wagyu. ��However, I was already full after the soup course, but I couldn't stop there, due to how wonderful the next 2 courses were! ��They have 4 different tasting menu options and I presume they are all fabulous! ��Each one has more options than the last. ��However, I chose the smallest one b/c I didn't feel like sitting th"
"Free Valet parking, good atmosphere, great food! what more do you want from a Greek place? The calamari is great for starters, the chicken and lamb entrees are good too! Get some of that Greek beer! aww yeah!"
"Great food & atmosphere.. You can't go wrong with their specials or any burger. Went tonight as only my 5th time and it was better than ever - just wish it wasn't so tight in there. If you're going out as two, invite a couple more people (the tables are that much better). All around great place, awesome food... One of the best spots in Chicago."
"Great authentic mexican food, the beef enchiladas were amazing, refried beans were superb, and the rice was delicious, excellent atmosphere, fast and friendly service"
Delicious!Some of the best clam chowder. Extra friendly as well.

"I've always liked the food at Glenn's but tonight the server was not good. ?I stopped in to place a carryout order. ?One item. ?She took the order, asked my name and then said it would be 20 minutes. ?I went across the street and waited, came back 20 minutes later, and she said Oh, I forgot to put your order in...you came in during the rush.. ?Well, don't take orders during the rush if you can't handle them. ?Sadly, I won't be making carryout order requests again in the future."
"We are an order out family. ��And, La Villa and Calo Restaurant on Clark Street were growing up, our favorite Italian Restaurants and, still are our choice for Italian in Chicago.For an excellent romantic evening, usually, it's La Villa. ��However, last Sunday night, the place was jam packed.Apparently Channel 11, mentioned them on ""Check Please,"" and it seemed as if everyone in Chicago saw the review.La Villa is awesome when it comes to food. ��It's unbelievable, when you find out how much you ate, yet, it didn't seem like a lot to our waiters.These, are huge portions! ��You won't ever go away from La Villa hungry. The waiter said to me, ""What did you eat? ��I don't see how you can have a whole steak left and be full?"" ��Trust me. ��I ate as much as I could and then, I had to stop. ��It was too d"
"Visited Chicago back in April - the girlfriend and I ate here our first night in town. ��Having read a lot about Bayless and hearing great things about his food I was very excited to try it for my myself. The wait was an hour or so. ��The hostess was polite and told us we could wait in the bar. ��We saddled up and ordered a couple drinks and their ceviche sampler platter. ��Margaritas were tasty, nothing over the top outrageous. Ceviche platter was insanely good.Got to our table (didn't have to go far as we were sat in the bar) and were promptly greeted by a very informative waiter. Ordered guacamole which was very good. ��GF got their Camarones Verdes and I opted for the Asada Brava. Who knew Flank steak could taste so good?!? ��Overall, I was very impressed. The only downer was that Frontera s"
"I love everything about this place! Great fresh Vietnamese food. Very, very, very nice owner, family and staff. Service is extremely friendly. When your check comes you are stunned at the terrific value. it's BYOB. And it's a very nice room. Add it all up and it is a hard to beat combination. My particular favorites: ANY of the wonderful soups. The Fisherman's Soup is great and very flavorful. I really like the curry noodles. The Banh Mi sandwiches are all terrific. This is one of my favorite places to eat in this city overflowing with great places to eat. I eat here at least once a week, which is saying a lot when there are so many places to choose from."
"After reading the reviews and reading Anthony Bourdain's 13 places to eat before you die, I was sold, I got there at 9:30 Saturday Morning ( 1 hour before opening) and there was already 10 people in line, I usually am not good waiting in line but every one in the line was upbeat and made great conversation. ? Once they opened, ?the line is slow, but once you get to order you are overwhelmed by amount of options, I ordered the Game of the week ( I think it had bison, Elk and Venison), the Foie Gras dog and also the famous Duck Fat French Fries. ? ?My lord... it was ?and incredible experience , ?the Foie Gras dog was very interesting, a duck sausage covered with 3 slices of foie gras, never been a fan of foie gras, but I leaned that I just haven't been eating it correctly because it belongs "
"I was hungry, in a hurry and just wanted something to eat. Anything would of done. ��I saw this little pizza shop in a very little shopping mall (strip). It only contained 3 stores. I entered and in a matter of 2 minutes or less (at lunch hour no less) I had a slice of pizza. Not expecting much I ��returned to my car for a quick bite. Three minutes later I went back for another. It was soooo sooooooo ��gooood. I couldn't believe it. I would give it 5 stars for the speed and service of the staff, and 4 stars for the pizza."
While the valet may be grouchy- this place is delic.Now I am from the mid-west and love my meat! ow amazing to be able to not have to cook for a weeks worth of protein.5 stars because for the money you pay you can eat enough meat for a week!
the best ��deep dish pizza ��It was good ��I would recomend it to my friends this was my first time at a ��chicago deep dish pizza restaurany ��I would definately be back. I am a fan of pizza
"Loved this restaurant! ��Very laid back and vibrant atmosphere with the bold painted walls and greenery. ��It feels like a family owned restaurant, but I'm not sure if it is. ��Try the brushetta."
"I've never been to the actual RJ Grunts but Its one of my favorite places to order from when I'm at work (when I can afford the calories lol). I love the pepercorn burger with the spicy ketchup and chips (Those chips are insane!).When ever the office is ordering food, we always consider RJ's when in the burger mood.:)"
Wow oh wow! So fresh and delciously unexpected. Huge portion (wrap) I ate for 2 days!!A coworker ordered this in for us and I'm a big fan. The hot dip is amazing and the hummus rocks as well!New #1.
"VERY GOOD. I always have to stop in here when I crave quality Mexican food. It's the little touches that make this place stand out- the bowl of spicy peppers and carrots they serve on the table. The soup they give you while you wait for your meal.The quality of the enchiladas is very good. The sauces are delicious. All around, a very good spot to eat. The ambiance is also very pleasant, they have carefully decorated the interior, it is NOT TACKY and it is very clean (unlike some other restaurants down the street)."
"um. what can i say thats positive. nothing. except for the cashier Catherine, everthing else sucked. The food took forever, no one knew where anything was, there were birds flying all over the place. I had to take catherine out of her cashier stand to show me where the tahini was because NO one else knew what it even was. so much for gourmet"
"Simply it is a find!! The food is always consistent and fantastic. I have never eaten inside the restaurant, but I've heard it's really cute. I always order delivery from them and I have loved everything I have ordered without exception. They are always on time and the service is unreal. The food is always steaming hot upon delivery. The gentleman who owns the restaurant is one of the nicest people I've ever dealt with. He remembers me every time and has made me a soup that his not on his menu (but should be!) when I had the flu. Then he sent me two large bowls of it for free along with a special tea he brewed!! I am such a fan of ��his cooking and his customer service that I hope everyone who reads this review gives this place a try. It is a gem along with the proprietor of this restaurant"
"I want to love you Chicago Diner, I want to so bad, alas, you disappoint me everytime. The service is usually pretty good, but the food is really not that great. I have had a reuben, not so great, a roast beef sandwhich, ick, ��veggie burgers, eh, taco salad, gross. The only thing I have ever had from here that is awesome, the vegan vanilla chai milkshake is absolutely amazing, nothing can compare,."
"Some of the best pho in Chicago! This place has good Vietnamese food at reasonable prices. Good, friendly and quick service. Their most popular dish is obviously their pho and I heard they cook their broth with beef bones (and yes, MSG, but doesn't everyone?) for hours, which produces a great flavor. Good spot for a cool summer evening or a freezing winter night, or any day of the year!"
"I went here recently and was completely BLOWN AWAY!!! The decor was AWESOME, the server we had was GREAT and offered suggestions to my friend and I. We ordered the White Collar Crime as the appetizer. Let me tell you, it was WONDERFUL!!! The hummus tasted exactly the way hummus should taste and was very smooth- the baba had a smoky taste to it that was really, really good. (I HIGHLY recommend it!) I had the Ponzi Scheme burger and she had the Identity Thief. My burger was cooked to perfection and her sandwich tasted so good, I had trouble deciding which one I liked more! I'm not much of a beer and wine drinker, but their selection is really good. It seems like they spent a lot of time picking the beers and wines they wanted to serve. The music wasn't very loud when we went, but that may be"
"Ive been coming here for at least a year now, and it is consistantly awesome! The service is great, even if you have kids (i know they can be a pain sometimes) Food is plentiful and the atmosphere is awesome."
"Brunched at Big Jones today because there was a huge line outside of our original destination, M. Henry. ��Glad we did!With no reservations, the owner politely found us a table and told us not to hesitate to let us know if we needed anything. ��Classy - thanks, Mark.The beignets arrived promptly with our server and did not disappoint. ��Since I am gluten free, my 'spare' beignet was quickly saddest up by my excited 7-year old. ��The coffee came in large mug with raw sugar and yummy cream. ��Cool kids milk cup was also a hit.Everyone enjoyed their entrees (Migas, French Toast and Country breakfast) and we were all full and happy. ��Great service, great food - would be a perfect 5, but it was darn chilly in the front of the dining room. ��There wasn't a line, but we didn't linger because we were co"
I absolutely love the food here. ��The service is hit or miss and with their proximity to Wrigley Field means you have to deal with Cubs fans. ��Head there in the off season.
Divine. Drinks and appetizers upstairs or dinner downstairs.The food is always perfect.Do yourself a favor and wear something nice.(in case I have to look at you)
"I love this place!!! Tuesdays and Thursdays are the best, with half off margaritas. The staff is always super nice, and since I work in the area I go in quite often (tues and thurs!) and they always remember me. The food is great and decently priced. Always get the taco salad or quesadillas, and its always the best. Thanks Mayan Palace!!"
"Thier pizza is really good. -its a good place to watch a game too! beer, food, big tv's!!"
Not bad for a fusion place. ��Defnitely some stuff not that authentic like their bibimbop. I would also say it's on the over priced end for the food they serve.
"We used to love this place and still love the atmosphere, but it's slipping. The appetizers are still our favorite dishes, especially the Camarones, but the entrees have slipped in flavor, meaning the Pernil tasted reheated and the Pollo was boring. Maybe it was just an off night because we went on on a Tuesday. But with our grande bill, it was a disappointment. We don't want to see this place go down the tubes,so kick it back up a notch! Oh, and the service was just okay."
"Excellent value for $22.00 4 servings of Bruschetta, Eggplant Parmigana and a dessert. Get out of town that is a great deal!Service excellent. Great Decor and all the staff are professional and not in your face.Will be back for more I am afraid for the waistline!"
My fiance brought me to Geja's for my birthday and it was fantastic! ��We had a cozy romantic table to ourselves with the perfect amount of attention from the staff. ��The food is great and a fun way to change up going out to dinner. ��We really enjoyed ourselves- Thanks!
"Incredible, incredible, incredible...excellent concept, great price, fast and friendly service. ��I am so glad your in the neighborhood! ��I'll be back soon!"
I've been a regular customer at the Diner since 1992. ��Since I'm vegan I definitely go there for the food and not the service (slow) and ambience (increasingly noisier as there are more annoying people there now than ever before!). ��I fully realize the food has always been good but not great. ��But who cares?!? ��It's a (vegetarian) diner -- not a three-star restaurant!
"Been coming here for over a year. ��My favorite injera of any of the ethiopian places I've tried (Ras Dashen, Ethiopian Diamond, Mama Desta). ��And the best Sambussas, too. ��I'm also a big fan of the whole fried tilapia, it's my favorite way to eat fish.The service the last two times I've been here has been SOOOOOOO much better than it used to be. ��Somebody is doing something right. ��Keep up the good work. ��I'll definitely be back."
"Well let me start off by saying that I have eaten cuban food before and i was shocked to taste such great cuban food in Chicago, the atmosphere was electric, cuban music playing and the hottest husband wife couple dancing behind the register so i dont know what was better but i know that if you havent been there go asap its like going to a show without the price tag, it is my new favorite place you will see what i meen when you go"
"La Villa is WAY overpriced!! I paid $17.90 for a plate of Spaghetti and Meatballs. It was decent, but there are several Italian restaurants that are so much better for the money. ��The prices on their website do not reflect the ACTUAL prices. ��Salad Bar does not come with anything as stated on Check Please. ��Nice people but this place is a joke. ��Almost Any Place in Little Italy is better and cheaper. ��Spent $60 for two people no tip!Salad Bar is a joke ---- everything from cans.Stay away from this scam of a joint."
"I love Garcia's. I grew up around Lincoln Square so it became one of my absolute favourite places to eat. I'm not really a fan of Mexican food in general, which is funny considering I'm part Mexican, but Garcia's is just too delicious. I, unfortunately, moved out to the suburbs with my family a few years back, but whenever I go to Chicago and am craving some good Mexican food, I head on over to Garcia's. My favourite food to order is their chicken flautas with sour cream and shredded cheese. Oh, and their chips and salsa are really good, too. Ay, now I'm hungry!Oh, and the only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the lack of room; my social anxiety flares up when I'm wedged between loud groups of people. Aside from that, I have no complaints. The food itself gets 5 star"
I took 12 business guests to The Kinzie Chop House during a trade show stay in Chicago. ��The restauant is a short cab ride or a comfy 10 block walk from the Hyatt near the river.Serving 12 people is not always easy yet the food and service was oustanding.I had the bone in Delmonico and it was very good. ��Members of our party has various steaks and fresh fish and the aroma and presentaion and flavor of everything was outstanding.We were seated in a back room that had space for large parties.....the staff took very good care of us.The scallops and calamari that we had for starters were fantastic.The wine list is very good.I often worry when I'm taking a large party to a restaurant (it's not easy to take care of 12 people or more) yet the Kinzie Chop House exceeded my every expectation. ��Ever
"Everything about tis place is right on the mark! Food, atmosphere and service are the best in aville. What a true treat for us neighborhood folk. Keep up the great work Mr. Big. I will be Jonesing for more soon!"
This place is super cool! Parking is a bit hard to find but we got lucky and found a spot right on Damen about a block away......Actually the spot was hard to find also as there's no signs lights nothing.....it sorta looks like a abandoned factory from the outside with just the address in the front which caught my eye.....so we entered walked threw the 12 foot purple curtains made a right and walked threw another set 12 foot purple curtains and we are immediately greeted by a friendly host and then given our table with a set of very comfortable high chairs and 2 candles on each of our tables.....Dimmed lights and mellow nice music playing in the background....Pretty well set up with great decor.....Our waitress was also super sweet.....The menu was a little confusing because page after pag
"We love, love, love ��Sabatino's!!!! ��It is the best for chicken marsala and veal dishes. ��I love their restaurant for not only the food and ambience but the wonderful staff. ��They are family friendly and make you feel welcome each and every time you come in. ��Try it, you will love it!!!!"
"Superdawg...what an amazing piece of Americana. I first heard about Superdawg from watching The Food Network. The boyfriend was skeptical of my request to drive all the way out to just get a hot dog but he obliged and I was in polish, kitsch, drive-in heaven.I'm not a Chicago-style hot dog fan so I get the polish whoopski (sp) dog every time. I also like the fried onions and the chocolate malt. The polish comes on an onion bun and I recommend just grilled onions and mustard. The dog is charred, fat, and oh so tasty.I didn't go for the full five stars because it's not THE BEST hot dog ever but it's definitely up there, up there."
"I really wanted to like this place. I enjoyed the food and drinks, but service and management was really poor. ��We got there a bit before our reservation and so sat at the bar where I enjoyed a fantastic caipirinha and my wife had a great mojito. The trouble came when the rest of our group arrived right on time for our 8 pm reservation and we were told that the table would be ready soon. Not a problem -- we're patient people. ��Except that soon = 40 minutes. ��A few complaints lodged and a few apologies offered, but they did nothing of substance to make up for us finally being seated at 8:40. What is the point of having a reservation if we'd have to wait for 40 minutes for the table? ��Our server was nice and genial but she was slow. Probably not her fault -- maybe no one told her that we had"
"Calo is quite the enigma. ��Boasting one of Chicago's finest thin crust pizzas is quite an acomplishment. ��Delivering beer and wine until 3 AM a save a Pambo's ass quite often, not to mention the cost of a DUI, thank you Calo. ��The enigma part is that the rest of the menu is medicore. ��You guys nail the pizza and ribs, but seem to just phone the rest of the menu in, what gives? ��You obviously have the skill sets, ��this is a very good restaurant on the verge of GREATNESS. ��You are almost there. ��One down note Pambo was ignored by the bartender (Miss Bucharest 1923) for 10 minutes and ended up leaving before thirsty."
Iv been to Mercat twicie and enjoyed both expierences very much. Had the tasting menu both times and would do it again-Food was of good quality and and was prepared with thought in mind. Dont be afraid to ask for certain dishes if you do the tasting. The braised rabbit agnolotti was fantastic-Wait staff was knowledgable about the menu very attentive.-High energy dining room-good sangrias-Not cheap
"Double-rainbow, all the way, oh my, what does it mean? No I'm not having a rainbowgasm. And I won't over-exaggerate. I don't think there is such a word, but you have to give it to these guys, they are pretty good when it comes down to ambiance, choice of food and selected service. I say selected service because as you might have read in other reviews, you might get attitude. You have to right for bad attitude ��in front of a customer. You go down when you do that, You're the loser when you do that, your business loses, you lose, you could lose your job. Its just plain wrong. Anyway service from some of the waiters and bars is ok. I like everything pasta. I ordered some gnocci and oricchiette, we were quite a group and very nice braised pork belly, pork roast, and had some toasted coconut an"
"Great place for breakfast. They also do not charge you extra for egg whites. I had the ham & cheese omelette w/ pancakes, I couldn't finish it all. The server was attentive and kept the coffee coming. Can't wait to come back and try the french toast."
"Garcia's is the best Mexican food I have had in years! Best find ever! Prices are great and the food is amazing. They don't skimp on the food, you always walk away full. Keep up the great food and service."
Good place to hung out with your friends. Food is so tasty and the price is reasonable.
"Really love their thin crust pizza and the award winning beer. ��Staff was very nice and helpful. ��Atmosphere is a lot of fun as well. ��Made it in for lunch and my son and I were the only ones in there for 30 minutes. ��Next time I'm in Chicago, I'll be back."
"My favorite middle eastern place in town. for a great deal, check out the salad bar, but be careful they charge by the pound. Decent prices, great selection of imported soda. Love any restaurant that lets you watch your food being made. Giving it 4 stars because I have yet to have it delivered."
"I used to eat here 3 or 4 times a year but no more and here's why. Twenty patrons were waiting outside for a table, patiently, in 30 degree weather. ��The maitre de blatantly took a bribe from some beeyotch to get seated immediately. ��Our party of 4 left immediately and dined at Lao ShangHai,which was every bit as good if not better."
"I have now been here three times, and each time has been amazing. I'm more into the sweet brunchy foods, and my husband is into the savory, which is convenient. I've had the white chocolate/caramel/pretzel pancakes, the red velvet pancakes, and the banana and bacon pancakes. All were just...perfect. The pancakes were all cooked well, and all of the fancy sweet toppings were delicious. Husband has enjoyed giant breakfast burrito, eggs benedict, and something with chorizo. Loved all of them, too. We've never had to wait for a table (luckily, we always are in town during the week, not the weekend), but I've heard this place can get quite crowded. If you can swing brunch during the week here, I would suggest that! The customer service is fantastic. Everyone is so kind, friendly and helpful. Al"
I am a fan of Glenn's Diner. ��The food here is fresh and great but the prices are a little high for my taste. ��The seafood specials are amazing along with all of their salads. Amazing little joint in Ravenswood but would be a 5 star review if the prices were a little lower. ��Enjoy!
"Great breakfast, highly recommend going there but just make sure you arrive early. Lines can be long otherwise! I also wrote a review for Yolk at movingoffcampus: http://www.movingoffcamp��_One of the few restaurants that makes a tough decision whether I want juice or coffee in the morning."
I love the French lady that helped me with flowers last week. ��She made my trip wonderful. ��They have a great selection of chocolates also.
"Meh. I don't really get the hype at this place. ��I mean, it's cute... the food is pretty good... but I am not ready to stand in line for this place, nor am I dying to go back either."
Had a variety of entrees and thought the atmosphere was fabulous! Very unique dishes made this a restaurant I will definitely come back to!
"A higher quality of pizza than most pizza joints in Chicago. ��The other dishes they offer are good too. ��The fried shrimp is great, and the burgers are pretty good too. ��If you are a meat-lover, order the Art's Meaty Delight, delicious! ��Great place to order from when every other delivery place starts tasting the same."
the thin crust is off the hook too!! just like the deep dish..
"Excellent atmosphere, food, and service. A perfect score for fun and romance."
"I have my own table every Wednesday night. Being from Brasil, I am very picky about Brasilian restaurants. Fogo De Chao is without a doubt the best Brasilian restaurant in the USA."
Best gourmet hot dog/sausage dog place in the entire world. ��I'm from California and have probably eaten here more than most Chicagoans. ��I am 5ft tall and weigh 100 pounds...and when I come here I will be sure to order at least three dogs off the special menu. ��The Foie Gras is my favorite and a must try!! BTW - Ate at Hot Doug's rival Frank N Dawgs and that place was absolutely disgusting. Hot Doug's all the way baby!!!!
"We've eaten in the restaurant and also ordered delivery too. ��The food is great, the staff is friendly. ��Go or order takeout. ��You won't be disappointed. ��You even get complimentary fresh fruit!"
"Love everything about this place. ��Let's start with the bar since that's what you see when you first walk in. ��The mixologis , Lynn House, I would marry her. ��She's professional, knowledgeable and pleasant as can be, with just enough attitude to keep the evening entertaining. ��She's also trained her staff so they are capable. ��You're comfortable just grabbing a drink or sitting at the bar for dinner.Now the main dining room. ��Graham is awesome. ��Food is so fantastic and also imaginative. ��Menu changes regularly with the seasons, which many places claim to do but really don't. Staff is approachable, knowledgeable and not pretentious at all. ��Some high end places, the people have NO clue what they are serving but act like they are offended when you ask. ��You won't find that here. ��They seem "
"We were there Oct. 8th. Wonderful food and atmosphere. Andrew our waiter was great and very personable. He wished us a happy anniversary and tended to us as if we were his only table. Steak was as promised, very tender and flavorful. We will be coming back! ��Great place for couples and groups of people. A little pricey(hence the special occasion) but worth it. Keep it up Ruth Chris!"
This has become my favorite place to eat in the city. The food choices have expanded and their specials are exceptional. I come here at least once each week with my husband. The soup here is great too! I am officially addicted!
"Easily the best, most authentic Pad Thai I've ever had!! the tiger cry is something everyone in chicago should try at least once. Blending citrus with spicy and making it just a little sweet is pure genius.To recap my evening at Opart: excellent food, extremely friendly staff, and a price that just could not be beat!"
I LOVE IRAZU!!!!!!!!!I've been eating here since WAY before the yuppy craze hit and it became a popular trendy spot....My FAVORITE: Vegetarian Burrito... platano maduros and jugo de parcha....yummmy!!!!!!
They give you as much as food as they do attitude. Both are plentiful. But they're basically 24 hours. Good barbecue.
DELICIOUS!!!! ��I love the pink spread and the flaming cheese! ��and the ocra and the lamb chops!! ��I go here any chance I get!
a little pricey but well worth it. i recommend you sit at the bar. havent tried the food. the drinks are tasty enough!
This restaurant was definitely worth the hype. The food was great and a good scene. It always wasn't as expensive as I would have thought. I highly recommend this restaurant.
"I have been waiting to go to Fronera Grill for quite a while. ��I love Rick Bayless, and had high expectations. ��I was completely disappointed with both the food and the service. ��I had a hair in my food and I told my server. ��Next, Jennifer (one of the managers) came over and told me that it was my hair. ��First of all, I am blonde and the hair was dark black. ��She was extremly rude and I had to almost fight to get a meal without a hair. ��Finally they gave me a new meal and it was not what I had the first time. ��I gave up and ate it anyways. ��I was completely unhappy with my experience and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
"Best steaks in town. Now most people would say Gibsons, but honestly for the price and tenderness of the meat, this is the place to go. I always get the blue cheese crusted filet. We usually share a house salad, which can feed about 4-5 people, awesome! I recommend the sweet potato with brown sugar as your side dish. Also they have great desserts that will melt in your moth.Every time my parents are in town, they want to come here, which I don't blame them. They also have killer Martini's here, which I like them extra dirty. Couple of these and I will be good for the night. Great service and ambiance as well."
"Love this place all the way around the board! ��excellent decorative food at fair prices. ��Trendy and you feel like your at ""the place to be"" despite the neighborhood.Best Basil Chicken in the city!"

"The lunch buffet last time i went was very good. Very busy location was the only negative since it was completely full. The reason why is it is huge, lots of good tasting food all at a decent price.I am going again today and will stick to this rating unless i need to raise it to 5 stars."
Excellent restaurant! ��Fantastic salad bar! ��Amazing meats! ��Wonderful service! and seriously if you go there PLEASE for yourself :) ��try tres leches cake!!! ��it is to die for! ��I can't wait to go there again!
This place is amazing! Great food and great atmosphere - not your typical BBQ joint.
"they have best beer selection in the city and the best atmosphere for having ��a beer in the dead of winter. oh, and they dont have any TV's! ��i have only eaten here twice, but both times the food was great. however, it can be tricky finding a good seat in here after 6pm."
"Summary: Q: How does this otherwise high quality place screw up soup?A: With surprising ease.The Details:Hubbie and I beat the Navy Pier system!! We attended the flower and garden show on complimentary tickets, parked off the pier at a meter AND ate at Fox and Obel for way less than the inflated prices on the Pier. So whats the gripe?We thought we'd take advantage of Fox & Obel's 2 hrs parking free w/$20 purchase - great deal! So we moved the car (meter ran out) and, after purchasing some items, we settled into their cafe for a late lunch. I ordered their vegetable pistou soup. Easy, right? I love pistou - the lightness, the flavor...yummy! I couldn't wait. And with fresh bread - how can you lose? Here's how.The soup arrived without a pretty swirly pistou floating on the surface of the cle"

"I ordered a pizza the other night. I wasn't in the mood for deep dish, so I decided to try Piece instead. It wasn't terrible, but I'd have to say I've had much better. They seem to use pretty cheap cheese and are very stingy with it too. I would've went for Pete's on Western,but I am out of their delivery zone. In retrospect, I wish I had just driven to Pete's."
"My wife and I dined here last week for our anniversary and it was killer! ��We haven't really eaten a whole lot of fondue before, but after this meal we definitely will. ��It was such a romantic night. ��Cal took care of us so attentively while peppering it with precisely timed moments of humor! ��We had the Conniseur and it was delicious. ��Everything was awesome; from the service to the food. ��A+ all the way!!!"
"Ah what a late night place. �� The barbacoa and lingua are the best. ��I dont come here thinking its Frontera Grill or something. ��I come for steaming hot, bountiful, freshly made late nite tacos and it does just that. �� And does it damn well. �� ��A winner"
"So amazing and so happy I found Coast! ��The decor is fabulous and the food is to-die-for! ��The waitstaff was very nice and cordial. ��To the people who say that they don't care for the snootiness, well then head out to the million other dives in Chicago and maybe you will fit in and be happier. ��Food and Service are great. ��I just wish they were not BYOB!"
"Besides the cramped seating inside this spot, I love this place. Its my favorite brunch spot. Ingredients are fresh and healthy. I have tried different menu options and they have always been super."
Star was a super waitress. Loved the fries. Super great food. Star needs a raise.
Being my first visit here I did not have high expectation for this place and was pleasantly surprised with the closeness to authenticity of the food. I ordered chicken vandaloo turned out to be highly spicy but amazingly satisfying; the service was also good not great. My friends ordered some veggie entr��e were also satisfied and happy through not completely they complained about some entr��e being too bland. Over all I am satisfied and would go there again.
"The dine in meal was quick and tasty. They have great hours for late night dining. I wish I had deeper pockets for the great array of cheeses they offer. The groceries are definitely high end with prices to reflect that. I would ask about the cupcakes ��(freshness) before buying though, they were a bit dry. The dark chocolate tarts are the best thing in the Bakery case!"
"Sunda was amazing! I have heard so many good things and finally got to experience for myself a few weeks ago for my first time. I really enjoyed the Crispy Brussel Sprout salad, which is something I probably wouldn't have tried on my own. The sushi was great, of course, The Tail of Two Tunas was my favorite and I know Spicy tuna is a classic, but some places don't get it right, but Sunda did. Had a roll that came with guacamole or something - too overwhelming, too many tastes and too heavy for a sushi roll - that is my only complaint of the night. We went on to have dessert, which completed the evening, we had something with a weird name, but none the less, it was awesome, some carrot cake dessert."
"Ok let me start with the food i would love to give 5 star on their food because they're delicious, The reason i'm giving 3 star is because their servers are SUCKS n RUDE.Servers are throw their food or side dishes in to your face that is not acceptable. And they'll talk to u in Korean which i don't understand.Also if u are not Korean or American they'll give you only 7 dishes of side dish which is sucks. I've been there more then 10 times but i never able to get a side dishes what Koreans or Americans get. Which is not COOL AT ALL. Last 2 time i've been there i complained about to get more side dishes and they gave me which i'm satisfied but they're just suppose to give it to you before they bring your ordered food.MY ONLY WISH IS GET A BEtter SErVER please if u really really wanna improve"
Best sushi joint to not serve alcohol. ��Can't blame it on the aaaacccohhhol lol! ��The white dragon rolls are the best. ��I do rec this place for sushi!
Best Deep Dish. Period. Had 'em all. �� This is the place.
went there for a quick bite on way out for the evening. Sat 3 of us in the pub at a table that was not steady. ��we ordered appetizers and burgers/tacos. The appetizer were fine (would be better if the table was steady) Then the sad part- burgers came without cheese and without bacon as ordered/promised. Had to send back. When the plates came back-the fries were cold. Asked for ketchup-- a normal request with burgers and fries. Took about 10 minutes- The burger and fries were gone by the time the ketchup arrived. Would not go back there- Should have planned better.
I love this place. ��I am a regular! ��Best Thai food in the city! ��I have taken my friends here and they love it.
"We had just arrived in Chicago from Virginia and called Giordano's to see what the wait time would be for a table for 4. It was 7pm on a Wednesday and we were told it woould be 15-30 minutes (other places quoted me at least an hour) so my wife and I packed up our kids and quickly walked to Giordano's. ��When we got there, the line was out the door and the hostess informed me that it would be at LEAST an hour wait, maybe 1-1/2 hours. ��My jaw dropped and I explained that I had been told by one of their employees on the phone, just 10 minutes prior, that the wait would only be 15-30 minutes. ��About this time, another employee, Bailey F., stepped up to the podium to listened to my plea, looked at my very hungry, young kids (It was an hour past their dinner time), pulled the hostess aside and th"
"Yes, indeed as good as it gets. Sunday brunch at 10 am and this place is already packed. Apparently they open at 9 and get packed by 9:10...for a good reason!! We had the blue crab cake eggs Benedict on an english muffin. done to perfection!! Also, ordered the new orleans scramble. Burst of southern flavor - can't be better. All brunch dishes come with the potato patty - very delicious. Topped with some good bottomless coffee. Nothing like good food to get the day started !!"
"My fiance and I were anxious to try this spot, as we love dining out all over the city and watch a lot of Top Chef. ��Graham Elliot looked promising and modern, so we admittedly went in with high hopes for a delicious meal.Our server was very nice, attentive. ��They have a very interesting cocktail menu so I asked which he would suggest. ��He said the Pixie was incredible so I was immediately sold. ��I received my drink and it tasted like unsweet grapefruit, tequila, and water. �� ��VERY disappointing. ��I couldn't even finish it.The server then brought popcorn to the table instead of bread or whatnot. ��This really set the tone for dinner. ��Graham Elliot is more interested in being funky and unique than actually making your dining experience a delicious one. ��The popcorn was good - but it was pop"
"My GF loves this place. I thought it was incredibly average. Fun place, mediocre food."
"I had one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in Chicago here. ?First and most importantly if you are going to eat here, request a table in the back room. ?If you get stuck at one of the restaurant tables by the bar, you will not be able to have a single conversation all night. ?So after being stuck at one of these loud tables, one of our party was also spilled on (because they tables are really jammed in there with little room for waiters to move). ?When we complained to the manager a group of 4 men and two women (one who does not drink), were offered pink champagne as the apologetic response. ?Needless to say only 1/6 would actually drink the pink champagne. ?The food by no means made up for the atmosphere or service, it was nothing special."
wow! the best tacos i've had in a looooong time. yummy:)
"Great food, great atmosphere, great philosophy, great service......every time."
We stopped in for a quick bite to eat and a drink or two. Great food and wonderful service. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a sophisticated place to go!
definetely the best stuffed pizza in chicago... have had 1 bad experience there but the other 100 times pizza is great
"Giordano's deserves zero stars!My husband and I visited Giordano's to experience their highly recommended pizza - were we disappointed! We visited at around 5:00pm on a Saturday, but were ready and willing for the anticipated wait. After giving our name at the host's stand and pre-ordering our pizza to reduce the wait after we got our table, we squeezed into the filled-to-capacity bar area. My husband went to the bar to order a beer but couldn't get the bartender's attention - because this bartender had his back to the customers more than he faced the multitudes of potential customers. After waiting for a while we thought we heard our name called and made our way to the host's stand. When we got there, we were rudely informed that it wasn't our name that was called. We continued to wait wi"
"The Bongo Room for Breakfast in Chicago is the BEST! Every day a different menu, with the BEST and most delicious items you have ever seen. Now they have 2 locations -- A MUST EAT in Chicago if you want the best -- I loved the Key Lime Pie Pancakes or Lemon Meringue Pancakes and there are different items each day. You won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Awesome Food A++++++++
"Working in the hospitality industry I am rarely impressed with many dining experiences, but this was a wonderful and welcomed exception. Everything from the greeting at the door to the service and quality of the food was fantastic. Our server was only there for two weeks but was ��extremely knowledgeable and unbelievably friendly and personable. ��Brian has created a great gem that truly makes each guest feel like royalty. After all, isn't that what we want when we are dining out?"
Harvest table...stick with the harvest table!
"WOW, WOW, WOW!!! Amazing. I took my girlfriend here for our 3 year anniversary about a month ago.... The best! Now, obviously, this is a dining experience for a special occasion, eating here regularly, I would be homeless, but worth the great evening. I have never seen food prepared in such an art like style, very impressive. I will be back for the next special occasion in my life. You should go."
"I go here a lot. ��But not really for the food. ��I go because I'm vegan, and it's nice to have the entire menu for an option. ��I also go because the wait staff is AMAZING. ��Some of them love to chat you up. ��Some of them simply like to do their job efficiently, and prefer to be brisk (but never rude). ��They'll make great suggestions and tell you to try a milkshake and a piece of cake--but you know they're doing it out of love for sugar, and not because they want your money. ��Seriously. ��They're great people. ��And they're great to talk to if you're looking for tattoo inspiration...As for the food: it's okay. ��It's definitely not deserving of the awards it wins. ��But I've absolutely had worse."
"I have been to the Third Coast at least 20 times over the last 10 years (I live in Seattle) and have always had consistently good food at unbelievable prices. ?They have vegan choices and great flavor. The ?drinks are good and coffee is great and if you like spice the cajun chicken penne will light you up. ?I agree with the New York Post - The Third Coast is as Chicago as Wrigley Field, and if you are coming to visit Chicago you need to pay the Third Coast a visit."
"Can you say too much salt? ��The chefs need to learn how to season things properly. ��3 of the 8 courses were way over salted. ��The fish entree also was not properly cooked. ��That is one of my pet peeves at nice restaurants. ��Fish that is cooked on the outside and raw in the middle. ��Where is Gordon Ramsay when you need him?!?Also, they offered no beverages other than flat water. ��I know it was BYOB, but they could have offered something, anything else. ��On a positive note, the servers were great and friendly. ��The presentation was very nice, and I liked the decor. ��But I expect a lot better food preparation for my money."
"Simply a great place to enjoy Vietnamese food! Everything is fresh and made to order. They have dinner specials that are reasonably priced, tasty and filling. ��Fresh fruit is provided for dessert which is about all I have room for after sampling their appetizers, soups and entrees. There's always some food left over. Highlights are the lemon grass beef wraps, beef with asparagus, beef pho, and lemon grass pork chops. Worth the trip if you don't live in the neighborhood."
"This is a suggestion for the hostess. ��Last night two of us arrived about 8 pm. ��We initially were hoping to sit in the bar, just for a drink. ��Then we decided: it's summer in Chicago, so let's sit outside. ��Only 3 of the many outdoor tables were occupied by total of 5 people. ��The temperature was upwards of 90 degreesand the sun was till bearing down, so it was unlikely there would be a crush of sudden outdoor dinner business. ��Yet, despite all the empty tables, the hostess needlessly, in my opinion, declined our request to have a drink at an outside table. ��I'm therefore left with a bad taste in my mouth for Q. ��Obviously, we went to a more customer-friendly, nearby establishment."
"Wakamono I love you! ��Your snow white roll awakens my palette and your miso soup has me begging for more. ��Why oh why don't you deliver to me? ��To help me keep my wallet lined with cash you say? ��Oh, Ok Wakamono I hear you and thanks for looking out. ��You know I still love our monthy visits. xo xo."
Amazing! ��This is the best Italian restaurant in the Chicago area! ��I just moved to Chicago a few months ago and I've yet to find a better Italian restaurant. ��Trust me!!!!! ��Don't forget to try the pumpkin ravoli!
We originally went for the beer...but no one told us they had world-class pizza!? ��I only lived in Wicker Park for 8 months but I probably went to Piece about 25 times. ��It got to the point where my friends stopped asking where I wanted to go to eat because they knew the answer was automatically 'Piece.'It's definitely a great place to take friends/family who are visiting and enjoy great beer...and it's also a great way to introduce/trick your frat-boy brother/cousin into trying REAL beer under the pretense that you can watch 'the game' there and eat pizza (the topping combinations are endless!).The only knock would be the sometimes inattentive staff...but who can blame them when they're constantly swamped. ��I've waited tables at places that didn't pack in as many people in a week as Piece
"Exceptional. ��Great service, awesome food. ��Valet parking was a bit costly, but thats to be expected in the area where Fogo is located. ��The Top Sirloin was a crowd favorite, followed closely by the bacon wrapped filet. ��The top sirloin guy and I are now best friends. ��Great place for date night to impress someone you have been dating for a bit (not a first date place! ��think about eating 9 servings of meat....not good on date #1) ��or good for business folks. ��Have been there with both types, and everyone has walked away impressed!"
"Just a fun experience. Great food knowledgeable, friendly wait staff.Tapas style. A million wine choices. Highly recommended. Period."
Giordano's definatly lives up to their wonderful reputation. ��We have eaten here many times and are always left satisfied.
"My father-in-law found this place online while planning a special birthday dinner for my mother-in-law, and had no idea we would be so lucky to find The 3rd Coast. We were all visiting Chicago from WI & MN, and 13 (8 adults and 5 kids ages 4-11) of us went over Easter weekend...While we are all very happy with our meals, what struck me was the amazing variety. We spanned the globe with our selections; from chocolate chip pancakes for one of the kids to Chinese noodle soup to a Waldorf salad to Cajun chicken pasta to steak, everything was between good and excellent. This is the place to go when you have a group with diverse tastes!The service was excellent. The owner, Janet, made special arrangements to accommodate our large group and also was sensitive to the other guests; we were seated i"
"This is a good Indian restaurant. Tasty food and nice atmosphere. Given the price, it is not quite the best, but very good."
"Rick Bayless has done it again. Very good food. Make sure you give yourself ample time to eat since the lines can get very long. Very creative twists to Latin food. Think of it more as upscale fast food. It seems to be structured very well...the lines move quickly, you order, sit down, and still feel as if you're at a sit down restaurant with Rick Bayless' wonderful creations. I have yet to order something I haven't enjoyed. Everything has been very good."
"This place deserves all the credit it gets. Dont tell anyone in chicago or NYC i said this, but its the best pizza ever! plain white with artichokes! yum! oh and the beer is just as amazing! I loved the camel toe (seriously thats what its called)"
Where's the revolution here? ��It's definitely not in the food or the service. ��This is more like orderly mediocrity!
"As a favorite restaurant of my husband's and mine, we make it a point when we are traveling to Chicago (we live in the Twin Cities) to stop in and have the lobster bisque. My husband raves about the bisque to everyone and anyone he sees. It really is the best around. Minneapolis has nothing that even compares. For my husband's birthday, I wrote a letter to Shaw's asking if it were possible to ship some lobster bisque to St. Paul, MN. It has never been done before, but Nannetta Wade, from Shaw's, worked with the chef and made a test batch to see if it could be frozen and still keep it's fresh flavor. It worked. My husband was ecstatic and told me it was the best birthday gift ever. I've never had a restaurant go above and beyond like Shaw's did. Their customer service is supurb and I will c"
"This place is dope. Period.The wings are F'ing awesome, and their bowls are really good too. Can't wait to try more of their stuff."
"This is my third review, my second after the one on DHResumes. You'll find that my comments will generally follow what Grams' always told me, ""Don't say nothin' at all if you ain't got nothin' good to say."" According to Yelp's stats that seems to separate me from more than 50% of Yelpers. In other words, I'll leave the berating to other people, while I'll review the places that I truly enjoy. For my culinary credentials, I grew up in a family that owns several restaurants that create amazing food. I have no association with any of the restaurants that I am reviewing other than that I eat at the mentioned locations and their food makes my stomach happy. Claro?Gino's East is Chicago. I've grown up eating this pizza and the memories are fond. This is the first Gino's East that my mom took me."
"My 2nd review on Yelp goes to my favorite pizzeria Fogo 2 Go. They opened up last year, are Brazilian(hence the name Fogo..means Fire i found out), and are just very unique. I normally order pizzas split 1/2 and 1/2, and have tried about 14 of their 60 types of pizza. I often repeat my favorites as well, but normally try a new type on at least half my pizza. �� Delivery here is longer than places like Dominos(haven't ordered from them in ages..Yuk), but worth the wait for me. They have other stuff like garlic knots, which are yummy fresh garlic bread twists they bake in their pizza oven. The Coxinha(??) is this delicious chicken/mash potato empanada thing that you just have to try too. I've bought my office pizzas and chicken for lunch from them in the Loop, and it was a big hit each time.."
"Wakamono used to be a small establishment. ��Back then it a little more quiet, cozy, and the food arrived quickly. ��Now it has expanded (a testament to the quality), but it doesn't appear they've hired any more sushi chefs. ��This had lead to what I consider a very, very long wait for my meal. ��The quality is excellent. ��I've been to this establishment more than a handful of times, and each one has been a delight to my tastebuds. ��But that is where the joy ends. ��The restaurant is far too large for the number of chefs they have. ��And the noise is just excessive. ��The entire place is built with very eye pleasing wood, but with the very loud music and large number of people, it makes conversing very difficult. ��Truthfully, during the nicer months, I would never eat there if I couldn't be certa"
"We had been to Bonsoiree (sic) once before for the vegetarian tasting menu, which was good but not as memorable as the spectacularly rude service from our waiter. Still, with a foodie friend visiting from out of town, we decided to give it another try. This time, we had a different waiter and an outstanding meal. In fact, I had only one complaint: we went on a Tuesday night intending to have the $30 prix fixe. When we sat down, the waiter came over and said something vague like Can we just cook for you tonight? No other explanation. I assumed this meant they wanted to bring us the chef's selections instead of choosing items for the prix fixe off the menu. But what we ended up with was the $70 Ultimate 7 Course Experience. As it turned out, this gave us a chance to sample many excellent cou"
"If you're looking to give yourself diarrhea, then by all means order an entree.But the pizza is pretty good"
*** Steak Taco Salad***.... I thought it was kinda gay ordering something with the word salad in it but damn it was not a salad that was a meal... Some girl insisted on me ordering it and it was mmmmm.... imma go there right after this review lol. the chicken fajitas is so so so good the veggy pepper and onion was so delicious... Ohhh and it was fairly cheap eats! =D
"One of my favorite places in the city to dine at. Its pretty much my weekly spot. I usual go when the weather is nice(which is rare now a days) and the patio is open. I've dined inside once during the many times going to Irazu and i have to say that was my least favorite experience, That's not Irazu's fault I just love their patio. Staff is awesome, I'm always waited on by either Omar or Amanda(Sorry if i got their names wrong.) Both are super awesome and friendly. From what I observed, It's a great place for family and friends, definitely a nice place to bring a date too. I always roll here solo, It's my private place to have a peaceful quiet meal, relax and enjoy the breeze. It's BYOB which is a big plus but I've yet to take advantage of that. I usually get the Vegetarian burrito and a S"
"While it seems that most people who decide to sample the pleasures of Costa Rica's pacific coast wind up in Tamarindo, I prefer Playa Flamingo for that off the beaten track feel. I'm more of a sailor than a surfer, and I don't seem to relate to twenty somethings very well. Yes, I am getting older. And wiser, I hope!A client brought me to Irazu for a casual working lunch and I was instantly transported back to a tumbledown cafe halfway between Daniel Oduber International Airport and Sardinal, on my way to a memorable tryst in Playa Flamingo. Ah, love's labors lost!Affairs of the heart may like a candle burn brightest before they expire, but the appeal of an Irazu oatmeal shake may be eternal. Ditto for the grilled plantains. Within the coarseness of its origins lie a complexity of textures "
Best hot dog in the city hands down. They now accept credit cards which is helpful when you don't have cash on you. The staff is always nice and courteous as well. I have had most of the items on the menu and have never been disappointed.
"Pizza was great, but the service wasn't very good. ��It took me 30 min. just to get one beer."
"I love this place! You can't go wrong with a salad bar and hot wings to boot! The music gets on my nerves, but we tolerate it. Also nearby Starbucks, Park, Zoo and Fro-Yo make for a fun filled afternoon!Only downside small, cramped bathrooms. Small place overall."
"Generally disappointing. I am a sucker for any place that has espresso drinks and croissants - my husband and I enjoy this for a leisurely breakfast. I won't be going back to Alliance for this. The barista was generally unpleasant - not outright rude, but ignored me for several minutes then took my order without much in the way of eye contact or interest. The cafe is in a separate room, but to get there you have to go outside, meaning you have to deal with two doors - not easy with a pastry in one hand and a cappuccino in ceramic in the other ��(I spilled half of it). The cafe itself was dirty, the tables crowded together cafeteria style, and the chairs uncomfortable."
This is my favorite pizza place in Chicago! The crust is the best for sure.
"Sushi is great, but I couldn't get over the bad service. I think we saw our server twice, when we ordered and when we got our check (which wehad to wait 20 minutes before we can even ask for it), he was nowhere to be seen, didn't even stop by to se how things were or to refill drinks. Good thing their sushi is so god, otherwise I would NEVER go back."
I love all of the tv's and excellent pizza! :) They always have some kind of cool special and you can always watch the game. Two thumbs up.
"This is the 2nd time I have ate at Shaw's and it was as good as I remember. ��Although I don't recall Shaw's being known as a sushi restaurant, the sushi was also outstanding."
"Cashier generally wears swish pants. ��Hip-hop lord on the prep line is always rapping about having money, but the dude works at Sultan's Market. ��Delivery team is full of post-grads with ironic beards and ugly, yet expensive track bikes. ��Food is delicious and cheap. ��The old lady is kind yet crazy and takes 7 minutes to pull a single dollar out of an open cash register."
"We are just talking about hot dogs only, not the other sausage stuff. I was there today at approx 11: am. ��The hot dog was over rated this must be what upscale northsiders regard as an excellent hot dog worth waiting for.The topping were great, very good quality. The wiener was not hot, it was room temperature we requested a steamed dogs. ��The bun was not steamed. The wet wiener and topping caused the bun to fall apart. Had to eat this stuff with a fork.I have to say Iwas a little bothered by employees who are playing/texting on cell phones while working. ��These people have a tip jar by the cashier."
"The BEST I've had, in my opinion. ��I usually order the combination plate and get the dill rice. ��The portions are huge, they give you more than enough and you will basically have two meals for the price of one. ��Definitely worth the money. ��I've tried the sword fish and it was excellent, considering I really don't eat seafood. �� I recommend this place to everyone."
"One of my favorites. Not cheap but worth it. The seafood is very fresh, great selection. The wait staff attentive but not obtrusive. Atmosphere is wonderful. My guests loved the Oyster selection and I thought the Salmon was outstanding."
"SORT BY DATE. READ THIS REVIEW. SEE SOMETHING IN COMMON? FOOD GOOD......SERVICE SUCKS! That is the only constant about this place. Great food...horrible service. I do not yelp, I thought this was a useless website, however i had an experience that motivated me here today. I have dined at the Pig 3 times. Once at the bar. This is what you need to know. great food, small portions. you'll drop 300 with a party of 4. However, the service is so bad its amazing that it can be categorized in the hospitality business. It should be re categorized into condescending experiences. Reminds me of getting ripped off by a mechanic without the smile.There is nothing hospitable about any of this staff. The servers and manager have always been aloof. It was as if I should thank them for allowing me to be the"
"I would love to give a higher rating to Anteprima but there has been a consistency issue. ��First time we went there it was a 4 boarding on 5 rating, we looked forward to coming back. ��The 2nd time was a 3 star on the food, atmosphere always a 4-5 experience, very cozy and lively. ��The reason 3 star on food was too much salt, a little dry on the rabbit dish I had, just not nailing the dishes. ��I also based my ratings with price in mind. ��If you going to charge $15-20 or more for an entree, you have to deliver a plate that meets the value. ��Unfortunately they come up short. ��The food is good here, one of the better Italian resturants in the city, but not consistently top. ��We want back a third time hoping for a great meal, and still got good to OK food. ��Service and atmosphere is very good, "
"If you're from the NW side and haven't had a superdawg, you haven't lived. ��Best dawgs around."
Foods ok. ��Way overpriced.
"This being my first Yelp review, I was hoping that it wouldn't have to be a negative one but sadly, after visiting Bin 36, it is. ��On a recent trip to Chicago for a conference, a colleague and I were referred to this place by the concierge at our hotel. ��I love wine (who doesn't) and one of my favorite things to do in a city is seek out a great vino-venue and soak it in. ��The place is a bit short on ambience - the open, strangely decorated space reminds me of the remodeled cafeteria at my alma matter. ��I was willing to overlook this, and my friend and I settled on a great glass of Spanish wine, which took 20 minutes to deliver to the table along with some water. ��Again, I was in no hurry so I shrugged it off. ��After the glasses were dropped off and we ordered a second round, the waiter sug"
"Well..once again best Athentic Greek food in town!!My Favorites:Baked Lamb With potatoes,Mediterranean fish,Pastichio...OH!!! there yogurt is AWESOME!!! now reading some reveiws ...if your food comes out to quike its because you order something like baked lamb that i always get...this kitchen is non stop...baked lamb takes about a hour to two hours to cook try to wait for your food right?!? anyway thumbs up for this restaurant!!"
"I was so excited to check out Purple Pig after hearing some great things... I'd heard some bad things too, but discounted them since the restaurant was relatively new at the time and working through 'growing pains' at that point (I thought)... I decided to reserve judgment and didn't head there until it had been open almost a year. ��When we arrived for our 8:30 reservation, we were told the wait would be at least 40 minutes. I don't mind waiting for a table (up to 2 hours) when I don't have a reservation. However, when I have a reservation, I don't expect to show up on time and wait for 40 minutes. What's worse is that our table was not actually ready in 40 minutes, but closer to 70. There was no accommodation made by the wait staff or management after such a long wait (and several 'check-"
"I love it here, great scene, always poppin'. I love the food. A must is the duck salad, absolute must. Sushi is really fresh too. Over all i must say that the vibe just takes the place over the top. Great fashion and hot people. Food is realyl good too. I wouldnt go there for just the sushi even though it is great, but for an overl all great feel great look great spend great kind of night."
"second time coming here, first with family and then for drinks with a friend. Both times were good, i like the atmosphere and the live music they have on Sundays. Food is pretty good and i really like the decor. I did give it an extra star for using locally grown food."
"My friends and I make it a point to go to Grand Lux cafe once for dinner and once for dessert every trip we take to Chicago! The best adjective I can think of for this place is; Exciting! The atmosphere is really cozy, artistic, and tastefully designed. The food is even better. My favorite item on the menu is the Chicken Parmesan. It's fresh, simple, tender, and obviously hand-crafted. When it comes to service, I've never been disappointed, and I set my standards very high. I can confidently say that this place has the friendliest, fastest, and most attentive service on Mag Mile. If you go here for dinner, be prepared to wait up to 3 hours, but also be prepared to be amazed with the quality.

"Came with my girlfriends to celebrate an engagement. ��Pros: ��All the food was excellent. ��All of it. ��Outdoor seating was nice, although I wish they'd had the heat torches going because it was chilly. ��Cons: ��Doesn't take reservations. 90+ minute wait. But it's a new, trendy place, so I understand that. ��We received terrible, terrible, service. ��Ben, I'm looking at you, and I remember your name because you might be the most disinterested, woe-is-me and above-it-all server I have ever encountered. ��Disgusted when we asked for recommendations, annoyed when we wanted to order more food, and generally just irritated at our general presence. ��It really burned me that he got a 20% mandatory gratuity from our party of 6 because he was clearly---CLEARLY--a 10% kind of guy. ��And you've really got t"
"Talk about bringing a slice of home with you, this place definitely brings me back! I was reading through the other reviews and hereis my input on them. First of all, I can honestly say being a Cuban from Miami that lived there all my life, THIS PLACE IS AUTHENTIC. Those puddles of oil and garlic in the bottom of your trays, the crowded restaurants, guess what? That is what a Cuban restaurant is all about. Why are people complaining about there being too many people in the first place? Isn't that the sign of a good restaurant? When I went there, the place was as packed as could be, but guess what? It took no longer than 7 minutes to receive my dinner. I went there expecting this place to be just as small as the other one, but was I surprised! Great memorabilia on the walls to look at, beau"
"I love this place! ��There is just something so good about there food. ��The ambiance is good and the service is right there too. ��I love there burritos and the Oatmeal shake is always a winner. ��I always get the guac n' chips for starters, I'm usually stuffed by the end of my meal. ��I think this place should open other locations."
"Once again, one of the best Korean places to go. After a busy day and not eating properly... nothing like a Dolsot and a Bulgogi to fill you up. Not to mention table full of side dishes. I've been there so many times that I don't mind the service at all. You just have to get their attention. (eye contact)"
"Love this place, but sometimes you get a good helping of food and other times it seems they just did not make enough. ��The staff lacks a bit in basic waiter skills, but hey I still go because the food is good."
"I am such a fan of this cafe and wine bar! ?I've been the the 3rd Coast several times, and always leave satisfied with my meal and experience. ?The best part about this restaurant is the combined cuisine and ambiance. ?The service is great, laid back but attentive. ?Meals to try: the Mediterranean Salad (green olives, feta cheese, fabulous citrus oregano vinagarette), the Turkey and Brie sandwich (melts in your mouth), and Diablo's Tacos (super fresh ingredients like cilantro, cabbage, onion, and amazing spicy salsa). ?I will go back again and again, I recommend the same to you!"
"I have to say that this place charges way to much for a sandwich/torta. I thought this was suppose to be like street food. The torta I had was with pork, bacon and avocado and some over salty sauce which was all to salty, and the bread was 75% of the sandwich. REALLY! Its a simple sandwich and the brick oven is a gimmick. It would taste just the same in an oven or toaster oven. This place is for SUCKERS who fall for this rip off crap. Maybe some people feel better when they pay way too much, and therefore they think it tastes better. There is nothing special about this place. Its all a big HYPE! Do you believe in the hype? I sure hope not."
"My extended family of 10 dined at Caro Mio last night. We were promptly seated at the time of our reservation, greeted warmly by the owner and staff, and assited with our drinks. The food, including appetizers and entres was outstanding. as was the service. Street parking was not a problem and the seating was close but not contentious. In conclusion, every dimension of a great dining experience was enjoyed. Caro Mio is now a regular spot for us. Thank you to the ownership and staff."
"The first and only time I went here we had to wait to go to the rooftop, so we were given a buzzer. That was totally fine. ��What was unacceptable was the 20 min. we had to wait to try to order a drink from an incompetent bartender who was manning a not that busy bar. ��We just walked out because we were ��not going to bend over backwards to try to give our money to people who clearly have no respect for their job."
"Great neighborhood restaurant in the Gold Coast! ?We had dinner, wine dessert; all the courses were outstanding, and the service was excellent. ?Warm friendly atmosphere, comfortable yet sophisticated late-evening dining - I highly recommend the 3rd Coast!"
"I'm from DC and the big restaurant trend there right now are gastropubs. ��Basically a place where you can get food that is beyond typical barfood and a shit ton of Belgian beer.Nothing in Chicago touches Hopleaf. ��Not even Cooper's.I always get:- mussels and frites for one, which are done perfectly. ��I used to summer in the south of France every year with my French grandma and parents and these are just as good- whatever confit they have--duck or pork or whatever. ��Just perfect really- lots of Delerium on tap (I'm cheap!) and Lambics (peche or framboise)Service is hit or miss. ��When I had a group of 15 here for my 23rd birthday, they were excellent. ��Sometimes during peak hours they're crazed and a little huffy."
"The food and the service here is great! I always get the large Tank special and my girlfriend usually gets the watercress soup. Both are seriously delicious. Yes, because the place is so good that there are times you will have to wait. Not to worry because if you don't mind sharing a table the turnaround is quick. Btw... stay away from the pig feet and pig blood soup. A lot of people like it but it just didn't do it for me."
"This place is not what you would think. It is not a bistro. It is slow to serve your meal but it is fast to charge your credit card to the point that they charge you while you still are waiting for your coffee. Our waitress was without skill badly needs an ��education.It is influenced by neither European nor American culture. A word of advice: stay away from the owner, his manners may embarrass you, his loud laughter may make you deaf.There is no modern twist to the cuisine particularly to Mediterranean. Tip: go there if you want to pay price of the modern French restaurant and eat as a Romanian peasant in the cave.Warning: their chairs may be very dangerous for your children. We witnessed how the fallen very heavy restaurant chair almost injured the child."
"This place is by far my favorite in Chicago. I went with a friend for a celebration dinner. We shared the crawfish appetizer and literally ended up fork-fighting over it. Their grits are like nothing I have ever tasted, so perfect and creamy. I went about a month ago and have gone at least 3 times now. I had the violet sweet tea the last time I went and all the girls at my table ended up getting one too it was so yummy. Service is wonderful,place is nicely decorated, easy to find. I can not rave enough about it."
"Sorry Garicas but you stink! I've lived in LS all my life, when it first opened it was good, but as soon as they started to do well - there went the quality. Sure it's always going to have business because of all the bar and people who don't mind eating 'Mexican slop' being passed as food. When you can't even melt the cheese on nachos or make guacamole and not puree of avocado, perhaps I'll think about returning. Go to Los Nopales, just south of this nasty pit!"
"Wow--so I'm definitely in the minority here, but I felt I needed to write a review because my and my husband's experience at Tru was so disappointing.We've been to many of the best restaurants in New York City, and when we had the opportunity to try Tru, we jumped at the chance. The prices were definitely befitting of a top restaurant, but the food could only be described as bizarre, even for our try-anything tastes.Most of the food we had there was cold, and the chef, whoever it was that cold winter night, thought it fitting to serve us everything in a cold, gelatinous bubble. I don't know where he/she got that idea, but it wasn't creative or fitting for a night where something warm and comforting would have been more appropriate.The wait staff, while EXTREMELY (almost to a fault) attenti"
"The food here was amazing! My husband and I took our sons here for one of our sons birthday. ��They personalized the menu with a Happy Birthday to him. ��The menu is pricey but is definitely worth it. Make sure you have a reservation (we did) as the place is packed. ��3 of us had the Veal stuffed with provolone, basil and tomato. It was amazing. My husband had the lobster stuffed pasta which was also out of this world.The only thing I would change is they could use a few more wines by they glass."
"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome! This place has got it all old town Chicago feel, great music and very nice staff. It is as though you step back into time with a mobster at the next table. I was shocked to see this place full on a Wednesday night.... This is a must see. Foe locals and visitors alike."
I live in the Bay Area and decided to send a long-distance cake gift. I did a little research and then called Alliance and told them I wanted a very special cake delivered for a very special record label (local in the area) - as they were about to put out one of our records. The clerk was familiar with the name and was super friendly. He said he knew just the cake and had the chef bake up this chocolate wonder and delivered it by afternoon of the next day. I got so many letters telling me how delicious it was that I almost tasted it in my own mouth. Thank you Alliance for your delicious cakes and friendly staff.
This place is overrated. It was very crowded and the wait was over 2 hours. All the meats were cooked in oil. The food was very pricey and not worth all of the trouble.
"I think the Bongo Room deserves a 5 star review based on the food but because it's a breakfast place that doesn't open until 9am I had to go with 4 stars. Having a child, I need to beat the morning rush for breakfast in Chicago which means eating very early. Aside from that one small complaint, the breakfast at the Bongo Room is by ffar the best in the city. ��A staple on the menu is the breakfast burrito but don't overlook the amazing pancakes which changes flavors with teh seasons."
"I've been to Hot Doug's on several occasions and it never fails to deliver what it promises....IN-CASED MEATS!!!! They have so many different varieties of sausages it's hard to choose. ��And by the time you've made it through the line you are so f'ing hungry that you might end up ordering one of everything. ��I've had nearly everything on the permanent menu and I can say it would be hard to go wrong with anything you choose.I know many rave about the duck fat fries. ��I'm not a big fan, I think they are severely overrated. ��So if you have a few hours to kill (1.5 hours waiting in line) make a trip to emporium."
"The Steak Tacos and Burritos deserve 5 stars. The food is so good, that there are 3 locations on the same block!!! ��The price is right, the taste is fantastic, ��but the place looks run down."
"On a recent trip to Chicago, we went to Brazzaz, Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil. ��As Brazilian churrascaria fans, we found Texas de Brazil to be the best of the Chicago bunch and one of the best we've ever been to. ��Each cut of meat really tasted different and demonstrated why you should be trying them all. ��Surprisingly, we found the sausage to be the perfect last dish, fitting perfectly with the wine recommended by our waiter. ��On both of our trips we found the staff very knowledgeble about wine selections (thanks Eric and Mike) and very attentive to our needs (i.e., requests for chimichurri because we didn't notice it was on the salad bar). ��The atmosphere was also very sophisticated and just right for a perfect adults' evening out."
"A friend and got delivery from Irazu and it was pretty good--arrived quickly considering I live on the far, far reaches of their delivery zone and the food was still warm. Had the tilapia tacos. I liked that they weren't fried, but still had all the other components of a good fish taco. The highlight was their yummy vinegar cabbage slaw. Also has some empenadas. I really like all the options for the filling, instead of just chicken or cheese. Really liked the zucchini one and the plantain one made a nice dessert."
"Pretty yummy!I eat at Garcia's about once a week, it seems. ��The location is super convenient for me - I pass by every day going to/from the train. ��The place is pretty small - ��there is usually one server who takes care of the bar and tables. ��Service is almost always lightning fast and efficient.I tend to be a creature of habit and mostly order the same things - flautas or enchiladas. ��Can't go wrong with either of those. ��Margaritas are strong and inexpensive. ��Chips and salsa good. ��Refried beans and guacamole kinda bad, though.Not the best I've had, but definitely good, fast and cheap!"
I love this bar!! They have great food and great beer. I work next to them and whenever me and my co-worker are on break we go there just to eat and chat..After work we like to go have a couple of drinks.. I think the bartender and the bouncer know our ��faces already. lol
"Our meal at Schwa was a masterpiece, with mouthwatering courses, perfect service, and yes, a crazy atmosphere. I flew in from Miami to meet one son from Milwaukee and another from LA for a gustatory week and it was indeed, the high point, even considering our meal at Alinea and Topolobompo. I did call 200 times to get the reservation and I wouldn't hesitate to do it again. Michael and his brother, Seth and the rest of the crew made us feel like beloved family and gave us a memory we'll never forget and hope to repeat. ��It takes culinary genius to create the dishes and warm and open hearts to give us such a superlative experience. Get your dialing finger ready! You'll be glad you did."
"great food, great lunch specials, and good service. ��i love this place every time i visit."
"Absolutely LOVE Carnivale! We live very close and when we moved in we went REALLY REALLY often... had to slow down a bit. Everything we've had there is delicious. It always feels like a party. Definately not subdued or quiet elegance.... but FUN. Great music, great food, great drinks. Chef Mark uses as much local and organic as possible. Flavors are fabulous. Go!"
"I went on a Sunday at 11:45am and never got a chanceTo step inside the restaurant as the snooty blondeMaitre'd stopped me at the door and asked if I had aReservation. I did not and was told it would be an hourOr more wait. ?I was with my infant son in his baby stroller.Then she said in a condescending tone  we don't allow strollers, so you are going to have to do something aboutthat (the stroller). ?Needless to say I left and took my patronage to Fork restaurant in Lincoln Square which to my delightWas very baby and stroller friendly.Note to families with babies and strollers, take your Business elsewhere as Glenn's Diner does notWelcome you."
"I came home late from work on a weekday and was in the mood for pizza. ��I had a flyer from art of pizza, so we ordered a large thin crust veggie. ��The Pizza was $28 ouch, when the hell did pizza become so damn expensive. ��If i remember correctly pizza used to be a cheap alternative to eating out anyways...i did not feel like calling other places and ordered.The pizza did come relatively quickly. The pizza was terrible, it might be some of the worst pizza i ever had. ��The pizza had not taste, it was the most blend thing i ever ate. ��The thin crust was too hard. ��the only good thing about it was that the veggies/toppings seemed fresh, but THEY HAD NO TASTE!!!I don't know how their deep dish is, but after the crap i ate and how much i paid, i will never eat or order from thereArt of Pizza ple"
"I have a hard time even giving this place a one star. ?To start, I ordered ?a salmon skin roll to go a few weeks ago and got a purina jerky treat instead. ?I could not even call to complain because I was afraid of what I might say. ?However, we did give it another try last night, hoping for a better dine in experience, but again were left disappointed. ?The spicy tuna was very fishy, and we couldn't bare to eat it. When we complained about the taste, the manager said that everyone else is eating it and not complaining. ?This is an unacceptable reply from a manager, and they have definitely lost an avid sushi goer along with some friends."
"We've eaten here a few times now, and it's great. ��Like others have said, the caldos were initially too salty, but they seem to have cooled out on the sodium. ��The wild mushroom torta is one of the best sandwiches I've eaten in the city. ��The one thing we haven't been thrilled with is the seafood caldo; the broth doesn't have much flavor and the fish is mediocre. ��I've really enjoyed everything else I've tried."
"Is there a category for 6 stars? ?I had a smoked rattlesnake sausage with blueberry-port sauce and smoked gouda cheese....what? ?Hot Doug's is culinary genius. ?From timing the ordering and seating, to the complete insanity/clarity of the sausage combinations there are more layers to this place than most 5 star establishments even think about. ?You can also go traditional with a red hot or italian or bratwurst or... If there is a line to get food there is a reason."
"While I do like interesting presentation with regard to food, the quality and flavors is what I'm after. ��Mercat didn't disappoint. ��I'd agree that portion size seems to be all over the board. ��We'd had the Serrano ham and spinach with fig salad. ��It was a huge portion, while other dishes like a risotto seemed to be much more in line with traditional tapas sizing.Our service was excellent. ��The waiter was on top of everything. ��I'd let him know that I was allergic to almonds and he assured me that the aforementioned salad could be done without them. ��The kitchen missed that, but he noticed it immediately, followed the expediter and removed the salad, noting that the kitchen had neglected to omit them. ��He literally watched the kitchen redo the salad to assure that there were no almonds inc"
Food was awesome and the atmosphere was authentic I thought minus the cold weather. Parking lot was a bit tight but over all it was a great experience!
Excellent
"After reading reviews of this place in Yelp I was concerned... I can't stand loud places. At any rate, I stopped by a bit after lunch time and it was not bad at all. The place was full but you could talk to others without screaming which is a lot in comparison to most places in Chicago. Yolk could use some sound paneling but the food was great and service was perfect. I will definitely be back."
"As I entered, I was greeted promptly by the chef! ��We were sat went for the larger menu, and everything was perfect! ��It is great to bring your own wine, and the chef was even so kind to pour us something to match a course! ��For me, that is really going above and beyond. ��It truly is an experience not to be missed. ��The food was seasoned perfectly. ��I didn't mind the phone tag as the restaurant seats only about 20. ��It is important to realize that there are about 4-6 people running the show. ��It is important to be flexible with the chef, and they will take care of you hands down.My new favorite restaurant in Chicago!"
"This place had great food. Staff was friendly. Skip the honey wine, its too sweet."
Great place to eat for cheap. ��Quick service.These guys just do it fast and correct.
"My boyfriend took me here for my bday. ��This place is awesome. ��It is a bit dark, but it sets the mood for a romantic place for two. ��Our waiter was very friendly and the food was amazing. ��I've had cheese fondu at other places before, but I've never actually got to cook the meat myself. ��That was fun. . �� and the dessert was sooo good. ��I was definitely full when I left, i didnt expect so much food. ��If you havent been here yet, you gotta eat here!!!"
"Went on Thursday night. Great atmosphere; however, that was about it. We (group of 3) ordered an appetizer (hushpuppies- decent). When appetizer arrived, we ordered main course. Literally three minutes later, while we hadn't even made it through two of the four appetizers, our main courses showed up (two brisket sandwiches and a pulled pork sandwhich). All three entrees were cold, including fries. It felt like we were eating fast-food. Very disappointing experience."
"The hostess in the front is rude and has very poor memory, even when writing party names down! ��Why this place gets more than 1 star from others is a huge mystery to me! ��The place is dirty, rude, and the food is what you can make at home. ��It is not worth it to come here and support this business."
"I used to go here like 15 years ago when I lived in the neighborhood. I recently started going back, as for some reason I had just forgotten about it! Maybe it's just that it is so low-key. Glad I rediscovered it...worth the trip from Lakeview. Nice old-world cozy atmosphere. Relaxed, friendly setting and staff. Fun mix of artsy Bohemian-types, theater types, young hipsters and older folks. But the food is the best part. Everything is good. Great salads (The Cobb is excellent), soups, entrees, sandwiches and desserts. Excellent pasta specials. Tasty toasted crispy garlic bread served with some dishes and with sandwiches such as their chicken breast. The fish tacos are great, made with either crispy grilled sea bass or tilappia (not a choice I think, just what they offered that night).Serve"
"It's kinda funny to me that so many people consider this to be Mexican food. Actually it's very watered-down compared to authentic Mexican food. ��That being said, I still enjoy eating here, but I just don't consider the to be truly 'Mexican'. I do like that it's very fast and it's very affordable, so yes, I don't mind recommending it, just don't be disappointed if you have your heart set on a Earth-shattering Mexican experience."
"This place is extra sexy with some of the best sushi I've ever tasted! ��It's best to have a reservation, but they will seat you at the sushi bar or community table without one. ��The service is great! ��If you are a sushi lover, you will not be disappointed. ��Also, try the ""oh no you didn't""...it's extra yummy!"
"I love Spanish food and tapas in general, so I may be a bit biased. ��However, the food at Mercat, esp. the rice dishes, is delish. My only complaint would be the restaurant is a bit too open and loud for my tastes."
"My first visit was on a Tuesday night last week with a group of ten people for a special occasion. I had made a reservation two days in advance over the phone. Open Table had said there were no reservations for the date and time I requested, so I am glad I called the restaurant directly, so I recommend doing that.The atmosphere was fun and classy. All the servers and staff we encountered were fantastic - friendly, very helpful, and enthusiastic. Each person took extra time with members of my party and it was much appreciated and refreshing.For my meal, I had the gnocchi. It was very tasty - different than other gnocchi I had eaten before and much better. The sauce was the most perfect blend garlic and light butter flavor and was not greasy at all. The vegetables were perfectly cooked and t"
"Good food, low prices, terrible service. Gorgeous presentation. The Thai food's better than the sushi, though I wish everything were a little spicier."
"I stopped by for the first time since moving to Chicago and the cupcakes were so good! The coffee is great but it is such a laid back casual place where you can lounge around and use your computer for hours on end, just like what cafes should be like!I can't wait to try the cake!!"
"We saw him , you can't imagine my excitement after waiting 8 months to go here. BUT, it is not worth visiting again. The menu sounds delicious but the execution was mediocre. Skirt steak tasted sour (was that intentional/marinated ?)- crab cake non existent. The pairing of the fingerling potatoes was good with the vegetables. The french toast and crepes were laughable. The bacon infused vodka with ginger beer was too strong as a drink (should be a shot) and my horchata/coffee/vodka/banana drink tasted like watered down coffee with vodka. The only thing that was executed well were the pommes frites with wasabi tobiko (EXCELLENT). Oh and it took 5 minutes to get coffee after I sent my drink back & my server never refilled my coffee. All in all, I wish I would've saved my 80 bucks.To top my e"
"We went to Geja's the first time yesterday and we LOVED IT! Just didn't think the price was fair for the full dinner, $51 per person for 4 little pieces of meat and 4 shrimps?? Next time we will just go with the cheese and chocolate fondue, it was enough to fill us up and had a fair price.When you decide to try on Geja's go with Oracio, he was our waiter and made sure we had an A-MA-ZING experience, for sure one of their best attendants, if not the best!!!"
My absolute favorite restaurant in the City. I got the Filet trio delivered to the hospital after giving birth to my 2nd child. Delivery was through a middle 3rd party. CEO delivery or something like that. I go every year for my Birthday dinner. Make a reservation or go early and you'll be fine.
"Very nice place. Good food, nice service. They tend to get very crowded, so that is when things get a little complicated. Wednesday is Lobster night so check it out for yourself."
"First off, when we moved back to Chicago from Seattle my husband and I were hunting for a real good Pho. So I got on yelp and immediately read the reviews on Tank noodles. Got to this place and was packed so we knew we came to the right place to eat some real nice soup. After a little wait, we sat down and ordered. Our food came shortly after and enjoyed every bit of it. Ever since then we've been coming to this place for about 3 years now. Never been disappointed. The only thing is it's always packed but that never bothered us because the food made up for it. Did i mention that this place is kid friendly? Well my little one eats everything but if he doesn't like it then he would just spit it out. Everything we give him he wants more and more. Now as for my older one, he's very picky and d"
The PIZZA IS NOT phenomenal and definitely not good enough. I do not consider this the best Pizza..yuk!!
Well worth the price and it's BYOB. The wait to get a table took longer than I was hoping.
"I love this place. The pizza is always packed with so much flavor my mouth just can't handle it. If you can, sit out on the patio on a nice summer day. Save room for dessert cause it is totally work the extra work at the gym the next day. The prices are a little higher but I think worth it."
Service was impeccable. Staff are very helpful and the owner works hard to ensure a good dining experience. ��Baby friendly restaurant that gave complimentary watermelon smoothies to the kids. We tried to replicate the smoothies at home but it was too watery. ��I have to learn the recipe. ��Pho was very delicious and the beef was tender. ��Too bad it's too far from my home but will eat here whenever we come to the zoo.
"Little Bucharest was awesome! ��Great beers, wines, appetizers, and entrees. Live music! Great service! Perfect place for a B Day party or any group get-together. Our server, Ana, was really cute too. The owner is like a Vegas Host! Top shelf as they say in Vegas!BTW-Try the Javameister.... Cheeky..."
Best brunch in Chicago. ��Crab legs and lobster bisque are amazing!
"Don't understand why we keep going back.Waiter ��eavesdrops and joins our conversation.Ugh. Hangs around , hovering which makes me uncomfortable. Food occasionally tastes good but mostly this is all about presentation, so bring your camera (no flash allowed) The dessert was not tasty. White chocolate spheres explode with bad tasting not sure whats inside. Hard to find a well priced wine that is not over-the-hill so ��we ordered two that were undrinkable. No one said anything but no one drank it either. One doesn't want to spoil the evening by making negative remarks. Especially with that ��hovering waiter.The last time I was there we had the wine paring menu and those wines were REALLY bad, many hungarian or other weird, cheap ethnic offerings.... Insulting. The night before we had been to RL"
"Italian cuisine, although delicious, normally strikes me as somewhat routine in comparison to the other great offerings in Chicago (i.e. Vietnamese, Thai, Lebanese, Swedish, etc.) BUT Sapori is marvelous. ��Not only is the food excellent, but the staff is attentive, helpful, and courteous. ��Anthony, the owner is lovely and warm, the epitome of the gracious host. ��Last night was my first (though definitely not my last) visit to Sapori and we opted for the family style servings. ��You can select 2 appetizers, 2 salads, 3 pastas/entrees, and 1 dessert from this menu. I loved everything I tried. ��The Risotto al Funghi was buttery and flavorful with delicious mushrooms. ��We also tried a Squash/Pumpkin dish that was seasoned perfectly. ��The Caprese salad - always a winner, and Brushetta for starte"
"Extremely disappointed in the service that was provided at the Mercat a la Planxa.The excitement & the high expectation of going to the tapas style restaurant was lost in the service provided. The waiter was reluctant to give us the great service he was providing our three neighboring couples, as he did not tell us the chef's special selections or even come to check up on us the entire time during dinner. I would also rate the tapas a being okay as some selections were quite salty for my taste. Made me feel like I'd rather go eat some Chinese dim sum in order to satisfy my cravings for small bite appetizers. I would not recommend this place especially if you are expecting your overall dining experience to be excellent."
I was intrigued by Iron Chef Jos�� Garces' place and decided to check it out.service was okay but the menu was left to his discretion.Trust me on this one let them choose sit back and enjoy......
Went on superbowl evening. Like many Chicago eateries you walk in and they try to seat you in the worst seat in the restaurant i.e. right outside the bathroom door. We ask the the greeters if we can move to another table and he says no because he wants to take care of the waiter! In addition they sat us next to a large group of loud potato factory workers. A very unpleasant evening made worse by the waiter standing over us while we calculated the tip. This place is a bomb - do not go! Pete.
"Been here for dinner twice. ��Impressed with the Gyro and Reuben sandwiches and have tried a few of the appetizers. ��The soy-shakes are really nice. ��The staff are friendly. ��It is a popular place so there is often a wait (and nowhere to wait but outside). ��Parking is handy with free spaces in the alley right beside the restaurant.I wouldn't recommend the brunch menu. ��Food was bland and served colder than it should have been. ��So, two times out of three I've been impressed."
"I wish I had the option to give this place NO stars, but alas, it isn't an option. While the cookies are great, the service is horrible. I stood around while no one even looked at me and when someone finally was able to help me, they were rude, did not welcome me or thank me. As a matter of fact, I wasn't even asked if I wanted anything else. The wood was dirty and coming up and there was the biggest leak in the ceiling. I would never waste my time to go into this place again. I mean if they keep the front (where everyone can see) dirty then who knows what the inside looks like!"
1500 reviews and a 4 1/2 average? ��All Star Hall Of Fame status!This place is worth the hype and well worth the wait in line!Everything I have ever eaten here is AMAZING I am glad I stopped by while visiting Chicago. ��The owner was very friendly and glad to (briefly) talk baseball even though there was a line around the block (for serious!)
"Excellent!!! ��Great food, reasonable price, and always good service. ��If you go on a weekend you'll need to anticipate about a 30-40 min wait if you arrive after 9:30. ��They're very good at estimating wait times and are always withing a couple minutes of what they tell you. ��They also have validated parking next door for $7."
The Bacon and Cheddar Elk Sausage with Goose Island Honker's Ale Mustard and Serendipity Cheese is fantastic!
"Absolutly LOVE this place. ��I find ��it to have great food very similar to the food Igrew up with as a child with my Cuban grandmother. ��The Mamey shakes are FANTASTIC! The guajirito sandwich is great (even though its not really cuban) and the rabo encendido is a personal favorite. ��The staff is great, the service is good, and and the food always brings me home. ��We eat here at least once a week (ok maybe twice). ��Its that good."
"Although the food was great, the service was mediocre, and the management was disappointing in their responsiveness. I was at Mastro's with a large party for a special occasion. The server spilled oil ?from a potato dish on my neck and shirt, ruining the shirt. I wiped my neck off at the time but didn't notice that the shirt was so heavily stained until my companions told me so outside the restaurant. When I spoke to the manager on duty (David), he was uniquely rude and condescending. David said that I was hassling him and that the fact that I called him after I left was weird and then he proceeded to hang up the phone on me after attempting to belittle me. As our party had been at Mastro's for a special occasion and had spent a lot of money, I expected a lot more in the way of customer se"
"SO EFFING GOOD. ��GREAT SERVICE. MANY TIMES, THE OWNER WILL COME TO YOUR TABLE TO MAKE YOU ARE DOING ALRIGHT. AND SOMETIMES HE EVEN THROUGH IN A FREE APPETIZER. ��HES SO SWEET. I just absolutely lovve this place"
"Took my Dad for Father's Day. ��We had a reservation and we still waited an extra half hour to sit because the kitchen was backed up. ��Once we got seated, the dining room was not even that full. ��The food was actually good and they gave you a lot of it. ��I had the brisket, ribs and chicken. ��Cole slaw and cornbread was good too! ��I would certainly order take out the next time I go to avoid the wait."
suckling pig sandwiches at this place? i don't care how good the bread is...what kind of creep kills a baby pig?
I love meat and this place has a lot of it. All you can eat and the meat servers are endless. The salad bar could be a lot better but what do you expect at a meat place. Pricey but you get what you pay for. The woman in the wine area doing acrobats are cool. The bananas that cleanse your pallet are to die for.
"The service here is fantastic, the food is good and the prices are very fair especially if you are going with a large crowd. Very authentic Mexican and down to earth. Try the Queso appetizer which is seasoned perfectly. You get an appetizer (usually soup) when you first arrive. Nice touch."
I like this wishbone alot more than the other on Washington . The hoppin jack is really Yummy and the staff was great
"i have been to this restaurant many times, always have had a great experiance . food is wonderful staff is friendly and helpful. the homemade pasta dishes are super. great wine selections."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Love the burgers & the fresh cut fries. The mixed drinks are great also. From the adult milkshakes, to the margaritas. Despite the fact that they are bigger than the tables, I love the over sized menus. Not to mention the cheesy decor. A good amount of kids come in, but when the place is across the street from a zoo that's expected."
"The best dine in Italian in Lakeview/Lincoln Park that I have found. Excellent food, good service, and prices. We usually have to wait a little while, but it's worth the wait. We prefer to sit downstairs..like the atmosphere better.. A top-notch restaurant!!"
"Hey fellow New Yorkers: It may not be Rays (both Famous and Original), but it's the closest thing you'll find to awesome NYC pizza anywhere outside of the Big Apple!I stopped in on a whim one day as I was departing the very nearby Diversey train station. After talking to the owner for a few minutes, somehow his time in Philly was mentioned... I immediately asked the question that all-too-often results in blank stares here in Chicago: ""Do you have white pizza?""His answer was the best thing I'd heard all day: ""Of course we do!""For those of you whom may not understand my jubilation, ""white pizza"" is quite common in NYC and the East Coast. It's an alternative to the all-too-familiar and frankly, rather boring, red pizza sauce. It's things like butter, oil, ricotta, etc. It is delicious.After p"
"Rick bayless: Enough said - the man is a genius and there isnt one bad item on the menu. Rick has a passion for local, quality and often organic ingredients. He never loses that in any of his resurants, including the two in Ohare which share many menu items with XOCO. That top chef torta, well you can tatste one and see why rick is the master! FACT: you havent lived til youve had bean to cup hot cocoa -it will give you muliple g spot orgasms. I miss this place greatly in NYC"
"This wasn't my first visit to Demera, but I wanted to share this particular experience with the restaurant. ��The service was very slow at first - we waited about 25 minutes to place the order - but the food was brought in fairly quickly. ��The food was delicious as always. ��We ordered a mix of vegetarian and meat dishes for two and were not disappointed by the taste at all. ��What we were disappointed with, however, was the size of the meat portions! ��One of the items (number 40 I believe) came as a little tiny chicken drumstick with a huge hard boiled egg. ��I like sharing food, but that was barely enough meat for one person to get a taste! ��The lamb portion was not very big either, as most of the stuff on the plate was bones. ��I am not sure if this was a random occasion or a change in servi"
"O.G. Korean.Awesome food, rude waitresses, you smell like the place when you leave, a bit pricey, but definitely a place to frequent."
"I been here twice and I felt there's absolute no room for disappointment here. Firstly the service was awesome, the servers on both the times were more than welling to explain the menu and even offer suggestions, the food was simple and tasty, I liked the lamb kebab with flavored rice, the dill rice was much more flavorful and tasty if you like dill. Even though i did not try many more dishes here I would strongly believe that most of them would turn out to be good judging by the 2 entr��e i tried. The only down side to this place is that I would have liked if the place was larger than it is as there isn't much place between tables and it gets really crowded during the weekends with a lots of wait times for bigger groups."
ok so heres the deal .honey jalapeno pork chops.that just blew my mind!
"I visted Alinea this past Friday night. I am torn about what to write for this review. Overall I enjoyed the experience, and I thought some of the dishes were absolutely hands down the most innovative food I have ever seen or tasted but I didn't leave there feeling completely blown away. Now, the only experience I have to compare is our visit to Per Se. While the techniques and presentation of these chefs could not be more different, I do think it's fair to compare and contrast ingredients used, atmosphere and service. I did the vegetarian menu and my husband did the standard tour. It was fascinating to see the Alinea's chef be able to play with each dish and make them aesthetically identical. His presentation was incredibly whimsical. However, for the price, which is $195 plus tax and gra"
"I have been to this restaurant several times and I every time I come, the service is excellent. I think the salad bar could be better and the meat could be a bit better however overall, I think it's worth it."
"If only it was kept a secret and wasn't so crowded! ��It is now too hard to get a table on the weekends, so I try to hit it up during the week."
"Ambience 5 starsService 5 starsfood 5 starsI made a reservation on open table. I got a phone call from Mastros the day before to confirm the reservation. I received a follow up call the day after our dining experience. Great job by the entire staff!Piano bar on the 1st floor was very elegant. I felt as if I needed a white jacket and was going to star in my own black and white film. Very classy, but you can wear a nice dress shirt with jeans and women can wear a casual dress. Was seated upstairs and the mood continue to awe. I received several compliments on the restaurant selection. Thanks Mastros ;)Our waitress was super friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be there. Presentation on the appetizers were great. We had the seared ahi tuna and crab cakes. Our party of 6 did not have a singl"
"Yum! I went here for brunch with my girlfriends and their kids and we had a great time. There was a long wait, but once they saw that we had young babies with us, they treated us like we were family and sat us quickly. (Although, that was probably annoying for the others in line!) The food is great. They have a huge selection of breakfast and lunch options, so everyone in our big group was happy. They have quite a few health-ish options, too."
The wait was longer than the time eating. Portions are big and food delicious. Worth the wait
"food is awesome, dogs are the best, but the wait is too long. you need to open at another location to better serve your customers. ;)"
"I have only had amazing meals at Big Jones. I have enjoyed both brunch and dinner there, with dinner being a total stand-out. The menu changes frequently and the starters are always outstanding. Most importantly, I feel Big Jones hires excellent wait staff. The service is always beyond professional and attentive. Very informed of their offerings."
Love the place! ��Great atmosphere and fun in the summer.They have a great assortment of foods along with a great wine selection.Fun to meet up with friends.
"I've been frequenting Piece now for 3 years, and It never gets old. ��The Pizza is in my mind and on my taste buds, the best in Chicago. ��All of the staff are kick ass people, even during the busy hours, when it gets REALLY crowded. So if u can get there early! ��Im not a big beer drinker (prefer vodka), but have tried all of the beers. ��Not bad at all, just I can only have 2 beforeI get really buzzed! ��All in all, my favorite place to hang-out and have pizza in chicago!"
"As you scan the menu, you notice an almost manga like play on names for Korean Cuisine. ?The Bibimbop is artfully referred to as the Buddha Bowl. ?However, as a word of warning, this is not a Korean Restaurant in every sense. ?You don't get the ten thousand side dishes that you would usually get from a many fine Korean establishments lining up the Northwest Side of Chicago (Lawrence/Lincoln/Western). ?This place shines for providing simple but delicious food for reasonable prices leaning on Korean spices and flavor. ?The Buddha Bowls are not served on Korean Stone Pots but the ingredients are certainly fresh with generous beef helpings at your request. ?They also have chicken offerings which are absolutely divine and gently guides you through a path of spices. ?For those who are spice-aver"
Pilsens finest mexican joint! This place has great food and a really cool atmosphere. It almost feels like you are stepping out of chicago and into genuine mexico!I eat at this place every chance I can.
Opart haas great fast service. I love there Bami Pad Lard Nar.
"We happened upon this place yesterday as Mercat la Planxa was closed due to the reopening festivities at the Blackstone.It's a great little spot, with a brasserie style bar that's comfortable yet sophisticated. The fondue appetizer with grilled bread was incredibly tasty. My friend had a smoked salmon sandwich with bacon that was also delicious. My lunch was marginal at best...I ordered a sandwich that had a medley of mushrooms that were far too woody to be in a sandwich. ��Also had the cauliflower soup du jour that was rather cold and had an odd consistency. The reason the place gets 5 stars is the customer service. I mentioned the food issues to the waitress and the owner came over immediately, apologized, comped the entire lunch...which consisted of several glasses of pricey wine. I'm gu"
"I came here last week and picked up carry-out and I have to say the service was amazing. ��I ordered online before I left work, and even though I showed up 15 mins early, it was ready. ��The guy working the register was super friendly too! The food, though it was good, nothing to write home about and a little overrated I think. ��I only got the chicken, corn, and rice/beans though, so maybe the pizza is key. ��And I would definitely not recommend dining in, it's pretty small."
"Ordered the dinner combo..spicy chicken shawerma, hummus, cucumber salad, and a falafel....and was treated at the hospital for food posioning. ��I was debating on even writing this review but honestly, i've been feeling real S($&ty since that day...and i honestly have to say that the place in my opinion is to dirty looking, which is why i really feel the food posioning really happen....1st time there and last."
"This place is great, they serve natural locally grown foods, their drinks are amazing, especially the bloody marry's, and the ambiance is really comfortable. They also have live music during the week. This is a great restaurant with a healthy and very satisfying menu."
"YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! ��My husband and I went here at the recommendation of one of his Brazilian coworkers and at first we were a little sticker shocked because the pizzas are pricey and we'd have to order two because I am lactose intolerant and would want a cheeseless while my hubby is all about the cheese. ��We continued to browse the menu and I saw that there was a 1/4 chicken meal that sounded good and my husband saw that they do pizza by the slice. ��We went for that and our dinner cost us only $9!! ��The chicken was as my husband put it, ""BEAUTIFUL"" - it was the most delish thing ever! ��The beans and rice on the side were also delectable!! ��Husband loved the pizza and we ever got free garlic knots since we sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen. ��Everyone was super friendly and we felt "
"really want to give it a 2.5found this place on yelp. ��had such a good rating + a monday deal so i had to try it out.4 of us went together, and they let us do 2 separate monday deals.there weren't too many appetizer or salads to choose from so we ended up getting the same ones, but we did get to try out 6 different entrees and 2 desserts.appetizers- avocado crostini: less flavorful guac on toast. ��meh.- fried calamari: decent (but can you really mess it up?)soup & salads- i think it was butternut squash. ��unpalatable :(- insalata stella: a nice salad. ��dressing was yummy. ��entrees- spaghetti & veal meatballs: overcooked and mushy spaghetti, and the meatballs lacked oomph. ��- mushroom risotto: again, overcooked. ��porridge-like.- pumpkin ravioli: deserved the hype. ��was delicious.- seafood l"
"I have a long history with Tru. I've been trying to recreate one of the most memorable dining experiences and one of the best dishes for the last seven years to disappointingly medicore results. As a consequence, I cannot recommend Tru due to its inconsistency and high price. The sexy but overly theatrical wall street circa 1986 inspired decor is a bit much. There are one or two too many servers per table. This gang bang approach to service seems to only work well in Asia and I would recommend they scale it back here in Chicago. Very tasty desserts are a consistently great finish to the meal, however."
"The perfect place for breakfast so far. Ambiance was warm and friendly, service was prompt, food was delicious. Portions were generous. Wife and I split eggs benedict and a side order of pancakes and we took home leftovers. There's a reason for the wait - the place is great."
A+ for the Goat Cheese Croquette salad and the Cheddar Ale Soup. ��Their coffee was also very good. ��I have ordered from here and dined in and both experiences were delightful.
Went to Chicago for vacation and found Yolk online before I left home. I wasn't disappointed. Everything was delicious. Only thing it gets loud in there and very crowded. I suggest get there before 9am on weekdays and weekends by 8:30am. I'll definitely eat there again on our next trip to the Windy City!
i used to rave about the food..now just okay
I am not a fan of waiting for anything for more than an hour and a half.This place has proven me wrong time and time again. ��Thank you Hot Doug's for remaining gigantic part of my life. ��Stop what you are doing and go to Hot Doug's right now.
"I don't want any other middle eastern after being here now over a dozen times. I absolutely love the Koubideh, Cornish Hen, Salmon Kabab & the Shirin Polo with Chicken here. Now when I go back I just want to knock down the rest of the menu. Service is great and the food always impresses. Forget Rezas or Andys. This is the PLACE!"
"AMAZING!! Fantastic food, wonderful service and a great atmosphere. The menu is very diverse and has something for everyone.I had the Nanadict which was fantastic, a great twist on the traditional eggs Benedict. My girlfriend had the Chilequilles, she loved it! Even the sides were amazing, the potatoes and scrambled eggs were good enough to be the main course.The atmosphere in restaurant was very friendly and the staff did everything in their power to insure our meal was a success.The pricing was right on par and we only waited a few moments to be seated at 11:30 on a Saturday.I will recommend Nana to all my friends."
"Gilt Bar is fantastic. ��Had dinner here on Friday night, great crowd and energy. ��Food & drink here are amazing. ��Bone marrow and steak tartare are the best Ive ever had. ��Rabbit pasta with marinated artichoke was incredible, never had an artichoke taste so good, ricotta gnocchi was excellent as well. ��Mussels were delicious and came a huge loaf of bread to dip in the broth - went great with the La Chouffe Houblon that was on draft as well. ��Meatballs were soooo good, went really well with the creamy polenta and brown butter. ��Fries are the best in Chicago. ��Finished with an assortment of candies, ice cream and a chocolate almond cake for dessert, excellent way to end the meal. ��The drink selection is great as well - good mix of craft beers, eclectic and affordable wines and cocktails. ��Se"
"I ordered a cake from Alliance for my aunts baby shower and it came out AMAZING! It was very pricey, didnt have enough strawberries and wasnt exactly the best cake I have ever had, but they decorated it amazingly well. ��I was mainly happy because the cake looked exceptionally well."
"My girlfriend and I decided on five stars for this. ��Despite Yelp's label of casual attire, the place itself was very well decorated and had an upper-scale family atmosphere. ��We felt a little under dressed compared to most of the other patrons, whom I would describe as relaxed business casual.The food really shined here. ��I had no experience with ""southern style"" cooking at all outside of ribs and barbecue. ��I decided to dive right in.I tried the grits & shrimp, which were phenomenal. ��I was afraid the grits would be bland, mushy, and other variations of bad. ��Instead, they were full of flavor, perfectly cooked, and went great with the shrimp and other vegetables. ��A+ dish.My girlfriend got a fantastic burger, which was priced right for what she received. ��The only complaint was she order"
"I do alot of traveling and have lived in 7 states since becoming an adult. �� I grew up in AZ and this was just like sitting down at my best friends grandmothers table. ��She didn't speak English, but could cook ��heaven on a plate or in a bowl. ��OMG! ��My heart skipped a beat and I savored every bite at this restaurant. ��There aren't any words to do it justice. ��The salsa has so much flavor and you can feel spice without the burn. ��Amazing!!!!! ��I am hitting this restaurant every time I visit Chicago."
My go-to place for Pho. ��I just get the super bowl of beef pho... and I'm good. ��You get a nice minty after taste and no bloated feeling afterwards.
"I'm not sure where to start. I'm slightly upset with myself to give this place a thumbs down. I wanted my experience to be like other experiences I've heard about from friends but it just wasn't up to par. The server Molly was nice but did not know a whole lot about the menu items. She just seemed to have the same answer for everything and was a bit indifferent. The food was okay, nothing memorable and the drinks are a bit over priced for the amount of ice shoved into the glass. I was built up with such high expectations and was completely let down. The ambiance is nice."
"REALLY GREAT...WITH ONE BIG CAVEATFantastic sandwiches - among the best in recent memory. The chroizo was perfect, lots of great flavors that worked really well together. Complimentary sparkling water is a great touch as well.HOWEVER...if you've ever had hot chocolate in Barcelona, you will be VERY disappointed by their Barcelona hot chocolate, which is like to real Barcelona hot chocolate the way Manischewitz Extra Heavy Malaga is to a bottle of vintage Chateau d'Yquem. If you drive all the way downtown expecting Barcelona-style hot chocolate you will be, like me, a not very happy camper."
"Last week me and my friend went to downtown Chicago to visit the Greek and Italian neighborhood. It was Sunday night so we decided to eat diner in one of the restaurants in Greektown. Our eyes were drawn to this restaurant.When we entered the restaurant one of the waiters came to us and showed us our seats. She gave us the menu cart and we decided to choose a signature sandwich: the Norwegian crest. This is a sandwich with house smoked salmon, capers, shaved onion and a cream sauce on Caraway Dark Rye Bread. The presentation of the plate was good and you could taste that the bread was freshly baked. We also decided to try a typical traditional Greek dessert, called Loukoumades, which wasn't really my thing.The service was good and the food was nice, so I would like to recommend this place "
"My go-to place for wings. ��They give you WHOLE wings, not segments! ��The Seoul Sassy sauce is my favorite. ��The Original Buddha Bowl is good, but bring your appetite, it's a huge portion! ��I like that you can get brown or white rice, too. ��Just remember to bring cash... they don't take plastic."
"4 stars for The Gage. We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon for lunch/brunch. ?I had the fish and chips it was fabulous. The service was great and the manager even stopped by our table to see how things were going and to thank us for stopping by. Seriously, when does that ever happen? Yes, I could probably find cheaper bar fare elsewhere, but this was decorated nicely and it was really clean which is worth the extra money to me! Next time, I will try it for dinner!"
Garcia's is one my favorite restaurants for mexican food. They are pretty generous with the amount of food they give and they provide great service. Their tortas and shimp seviche are the best in Chicago! Every time I am in the Square I must stop in!
"This is the definitive Chicago deep dish pizza. ��Lou Malnati's is a close second, with Uno's and Due's tied for third depending on how many tourists you have to claw through to get a seat. ��There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said before. ��If you're going to see a movie at the theater across the street, give yourself about two hours to come here and get a delicious dinner beforehand."
"Great service, great food."
"the churro was the best, however a little pricey for a churro. ��But i can't stop thinking about how i need just one more. ��My husband and I split a cuban sandwich and some of the homemade hot chocolate. ��I have always been a big fan of Bayless. ��He stays true to good, local flavors and ingredients. ��XoCo is not to be missed. ��The line was a little long (about 25-30 minutes), but isn't it everywhere in Chicago?"
"Excellent service, superior food. ?This is the second Brazilian restaurant I've been to. ?It's real tempting to dive into the most excellent salad bar but DON'T! ?Save it for the better cuts of beef waiters offer you. ?You have a chip on your table. ?Leave it red and eat in peace, turn it green and within seconds a waiter serves you one of 15 varieties of meat. ?Pricey? ?Oh heck yes. ?You do not want to make this your favorite bar unless your The Donald but in respects of once a year or to seriously impress a friend/client this place is it. ?One tip though, emailing in a reservation only means you get in the door. ?We did have to wait another 20 minutes to get seated."
One of the lamest restaurants in Chicago! ��Horrible service. ��CASH ONLY in the downstairs lounge. No Exceptions! ��Even when you have a group of 15 people! Will tell you to go to the ATM! ��Definitely not a place to bring a big group. They will not accommodate you! Unhelpful hostesses and staff. ��Food is fine...but not worth waiting for. ��This is one to avoid!
"Disclaimer: I visited this restaurant on Monday for their family style weekly special.The Monday deal is fantastic: $21 per person gets you choice of 2 apps, 2 soup/salads, 3 entrees, and dessert. ?If you have more than 2 people, they just increase the portions. ?So much food for the money.The atmosphere, service and price all get A's, and the food a solid B. ?I would definitely return."
"MY DISSATISFACTION OF THIS PLACE MADE ME CREATE A YELP ACCOUNT. �� (2 stars because the food was alright!)We just moved to Lakeview a couple months ago. My sister ordered from this place the day we moved. ��The food was alright (cheese and veggie pizzas, cant really mess that up), however it was an hour and half late (over 2 hours total). ��We called and asked about the food multiple times and they said ""Sorry, the drivers are all backed up with other restaurants""... are you kidding me? you are a pizzeria ��and you ""share"" drivers. (btw a very unpleasant driver, even though we still tipped, since it wasnt his fault)The lady on the phone was rude, however she did give us a discount on our next order. ��So we tried again....... this time food came on time, the buffalo chicken pizza would have bee"
When people talk about Chicago style deep dish this is the place that you want to come. I lived just north of Chicago for about a year and I would travel about 1 hour by train and walk there almost every weekend or whenever I got the chance.The pizza is phenomenal my ��buddies would have a little challenge going to see who could eat the most; needless to say he ended up finishing a medium by himself.
"Come on people. ��You seriously trust the City of Chicago to decide what is clean and what isn't when the biggest Vermin this side of the Mississippi is running the city? ��Go in, check it out for yourself. ��ITS CLEAN. ��Ask to see the kitchen. ��Go with an LTH Forum Group--many times they have special dinners and tours. ��But please do not take what the City of Chicago, nay, the entire State of Illinois, says as absolute truth because they have been known to make absolutely inane decisions. ��Remember the Foie Gras debacle? ��Enough said. ��Check it out for yourself."
"This review is in response to Cody M's review on 7/4 and his embarassment.You are placing your embarassment in the wrong place...it belongs with you and your full of lies review.I am one of the two servers that tried to take care of your group. The second server was named Michael, not Justin, as you listed. Your whole party was not cut off...only the 5 of you who were either slurring already, couldn't sit up straight or couldn't focus on your servers. The other 6 were served as they asked for drinks. And yes, there were only 11 of you...not 13 or 16 like you spewed in the managers face as you cussed her and threatened these reviews on here to try and get your way with the bottles of champagne. You were not allowed the champagne because 5 of you were intoxicated and we have laws to abide by"
"Good brunch menu. I don't tend to go there for lunch or dinner. Breakfast burrito is pretty good. The coffee isn't the greatest, but not enough to make you want to stay away. Good atmosphere. Try to get a seat in the library area between the fireplace and the books."
"Love this place. ��Can get loud when it is very busy, but good old Italian. ��We go there so often- feels like we're sitting at our kitchen table- ��They are laid back and so nice! ��The staff has become friends and treats us well!"
"We went to Pilsen to buy a bike from a guy off of Craigslist and he pointed us in the direction of Nuevo Leon for dinner. Great tip! Friendly service, good food, great atmosphere, free yummy appetizers, secure parking lot, on-site ATM, byob, warm chips, cold Cokes... what's not to love? The guy at the table next to us got the Mole, and it looked like he was eating hot fudge chicken -- Amazing. Bring the kids. You'll feel like you took a little road trip to Mexico with them. Totally great experience all around."
"I've been eating at Garcia since I was 14. ��I always love it while I'm eating. ��Resently, however, I've been getting really sick about an hour later. ��I mean REALLY, REALLY, I feel bad for my roommates, sick."
I have had Wishbone delivered and it was solid - Seafood Chowder is good - Chicken Andouille Po' Boy is also good.
"I don't think it gets more authentic than this!Clean restaurant with quick, friendly service. Food comes out steaming hot and fresh. The Tiger's Cry is awesome as are the soups and peanut satay! I crave their food just thinking about it!!!Don't fear its location under a train track...you can hardly hear a thing!"
"I think I like the hype. This is a great place if you are looking for a great selection of wines, and want a great environment to catch up with friends after a long day Downtown."
"So i was very intrigued with the interest in the restaurant, always a line around the block on weekends. Till i went and waited all day to get a hot dog? Wasnt that amazing, was just a hot dog...there are other restaurants like this in chicago-without the long line-tastes the same...While it was good, and service was great...i dont understand the hype...i was expecting something greater."
"Came in with my girlfriend and another couple last night for dinner. There was a bit of a wait, but we wanted to watch the Illini game so we had a drink at the bar and waited about 15 minutes- they quoted us 20. There were a lot of attractive people there and servers there so we thought we were in a for a Rockit-esque night. The first surprise was the big bartender John, who I recognized from Keefer's. All smiles and a stiff drink. Really friendly and asked us if we were from the neighborhood. This was my first suprise- the only place on the street where I've been asked that and I started feeling like we were in for a fun night. When we got to our table we were greeted quickly and had waters and more cocktails quickly.The waitress recommended that we try the smoked chicken nachos and onion"
"June 9,2011I'm from out of town and my first time at Calo's was exceptional. ��Ray, the waiter, was very helpful and recommended a delicious pasta fish for my husband and I. ��The luncheon atmosphere was very pleasant, the service by the waiter as well as the bus boy, was memorable. ��I will definitely be back to visit and I'm I'm hoping to have this same waiter, as helped make my husband and I feel very comfortable and satisfied."
"In all fairness we were there early on a Sunday and the restaurant did not have its act together. Of course once it opens its doors every restaurant should have it together. This is a convention kind of place. It is a lot of food, some of it is good. Not haute cuisine by any measure. May eat here again, may not."
"Amazing. ��This place doesn't need a long review. ��I've only tried a few of the brunch items because every time I go back I crave them again - the breakfast burrito, breakfast sandwich, and some sort of egg thing I can't remember off the top of my head....super helpful I'm sure.However, my best advice is to go with a group of three of four and put good judgment aside for the 5 minutes it takes to order a ridiculous dessert pancake at the end of your meal. ��We ordered some white chocolate, peanut butter insanity. ��I still salivate a little when I think about it..."
Food - Yummy and plentifulService - Raquel is awesomeAmbiance - ChicagoMusic - Tom Moran and his accordion.Need I say more?
"While I am a native, I am a bit of a foodie and have traveled great distancesto have the best meals. I grew up eating pizza from places like King's over in Oak Park. I have had pizza while visiting Italy, and from coast to coast in the US. I have had deep dish from Lou Malnatti's, Gino's East, Pizzaria Uno, My Pi over on the east side and Giordano's. The best that I have ever had was Giordano's, hands down. I work in Louisiana and Giordano's is one of the things I miss most."
"I try to reserve the 5 stars - but this place deserves it. ��Friendly staff, great environment, unique food done well, quick service - really can't go too wrong here. ��Though I've been here numerous times I recently went here for breakfast which turned out still to be a great treat."
"Killer milkshakes, great classic food, but sometimes their faux-meat main dishes can go a bit overboard (some of their burgers are just overloaded with flavors, which can be overwhelming). The staff are all super friendly and interesting, but the noise level in there can be a little crazy. Really, a 3.5 rating, but I'll give them four because I've had good times there."
"Our group of Chicagoans and relatives from out-of-town went to Frontera last night. There was a situation that developed but Rick Bayless and his team handled it with grace and utmost concern for us, the customers. We ended up having a fabulous time with excellent, innovative, tasty food and drinks. The service and atmosphere was great, as always. Yes, there will likely be a wait, but it is well worth it. Can't say enough good things about Frontera Grill."
"Truffle Popcorn, Follipops(?) Yes, sir! May I have some more. The 5 course tasting out of this world. Dishes described in every detail. Server super friendly , kind and wonderful. I left with a warm and fuzzy feeling. Only thing. Some guy, (Micheal?) with a ��bald head sorta mumbled something about wine to us, seemed really Intense ( read: coked out of his mind) ��didn't seem to vibe with whole GE thingy, sorta swarmy and car salesman like."
This place is Peking Duck HEAVEN!!! Everything on their menu is absolutely amazing. ��By far the BEST Chinese restaurant I have ever eaten at!! ��If you haven't eaten here you are missing out!!
"My girlfriend and I had to wait a half an hour to get in. We watched several people who showed up after us get seated first. The premise the restaurant is set upon is a jail theme with heavy metal music playing constantly (and loudly). There are something like 13 TVs set up in the restaurant and all of them play a slide show that would be put to better use as a 14 year old's screen saver. Some of the slides include pictures that may put off your appetite, such as stills of singers spitting. The atmosphere seems a little insincere considering the restaurant is full of hipsters, who probably couldn't name any of the songs they listened to whilst dining. The staff is metal though, our waitress proved it by dressing ridiculously (mesh shirt with a bikini top, personally I prefer my servers to "
"Its a sausage fest lol, but fun place to watch sports. Cheap drinks on certain nights. Food was good."
"I've been eating Indie since 2005 and have never had a problem with delivery. ��It usually arrives within 20 minutes and not the quoted 45 to an hour. ��It's never been cold. ��The presentation is beautiful, (when dining-in). They are a very friendly but the servers need to work on ""timing"". ��Last visit I finished my meal before my partners dish even arrived and nothing was comped. ��Indie, I love you and your food but the customer service seems to be questionable lately."
I am so fortunate to live so close to this place. ��The pastries are as good as any I've ever had (but you pay for the amazing factor) and I love the atmosphere. ��The people are friendly and they offer free wi-fi if you need to get something done in the lounge next door. ��You will not find a better bakery in the city...outstanding.
I went to this restaurant for my 22 birthday and it was amazing! When my group and I arrived the place mats said Happy Birthday Melissa. How nice is that? The food was served in large portions and it was excellent.
"Think red leather booths, christmas lights year-round as part of the decor, and having to plan a big workout for the following day, because this isn't ""light eating"". But if you have a craving for Old World Italian in a slightly kitschy, very friendly setting, then this is THE place to go. I have to admit, I lived in the neighborhood of this place (Old Irving) 10 years ago, but only ordered take-out pizza back then. I had never set foot in the restaurant area. Boy, was I missing out! Inexpensive, solid Italian food and great service combine to make this a fun change of pace. They have picked up a lot of new business since being featured on Check Please, but the quality remains unchanged. Delicious mussels, (the small variety, not the overly huge rubbery kind) are a good start. You will be "
"I have eaten at Caro Mio about half dozen times now, and I'm a little torn. ��It's BYOB, which is great, and the service is excellent, but the food is very hit-or-miss (which is why I took away a star). ��The whole place is full of plants, so you feel like you're eating in some sort of dark botanical garden. ��The ambiance is very nice at night with all of the candles. ��Their servings are huge, like most Italian places, so you have another meal to take home. ��Some of the heavier sauces are very salty, which is where I think I go wrong. ��The fresher, simpler dishes tend to be a lot better tasting. ��The roasted vegetable appetizer is very good and so are the desserts. ��Their seafood entrees are also great. ��The people who work there are very friendly and helpful. ��My husband and I went there be"
Ya gotta love Sultans.Why you ask?Falafel balls. ��Chicken schwarma. warm pitas and smooth hummus. Cucumber salad I forget the name of but is the perfect cool compliment to the warm spicy chicken. ��All very affordable. ��We split the above and it's like $11 total. And the guy at the cash register is just so nice. Gotta love Sultans. And saying falafel balls is fun too.
good food nice price clean place loved the atmospher but not the service
"Well, if you read through the reviews you get the picture. Everyone who actually got to eat here gave 5 stars. Everyone who got the run around and cancelations gave 1. The food is some of the best around. It took quite a while to get in Schwa and we did have one cancelation but for the most part I think we got lucky. Once inside the food is every bit as good as advertised. Make of it what you will. The food was worth the headache to me."
"I love this place. I have been there twice and the owner remembered ��me and greeted me like if I was a long term customer which I will become. As soon as my friends and I sat down, the ��waiting staff greeted us very pleasantly and enthusiastic. Not only were the dishes hot, large and delicious but the waiter brought us a dish on the house. I guess because the owner recognized us. At the end of the night we were very stuffed. The atmosphere of this restaurant made us feel very relax and enjoy our food even more.Not only the owner is passionate about the restaurant but also very adorable and friendly. The waiting staff was excellent. For anyone that has not tried Vietnamese cuisine I definitely recommend this restaurant so you could have a good first time experience. For those that have trie"
Not a bad back-up plan.
"The soups here are phenomenal, and the heat on the sauces are perfect! ��Again, quality food at very reasonable prices. ��I'm loving the wave of restaurants like these in Chicago...thank you to all the restaurant pioneers of Chicago:)"
"Really is as good as it gets. The manager let our group of three in 30 minutes before close, and we still received great service along with great food. Salad bar is extensive and delicious, and of course their meats and their selections are out this world! Thank you so much Brazzaz :)"
"One word - GREASY! ��People in Chicago don't know anything about food if they wait in line for this place. ��What's the deal? ��These guys should stick to the bar business. ��Definitely not the ""real deal""."
"Just returned from Costa Rica, addicted to the food - and NUEVO LEON broke my addiction:) ��WOW. ��Basically, you pay for your beverages, & get a humungous, delicious ENTREE FOR FREE! ��They even made me something NOT on the menu when I mentioned a dish I love. ��Gets my vote for the BEST MEXICAN FOOD in Chicago. Can't wait to try everything ON the menu! (And though my husband thought it was 'risky' parking his 'baby' there, hey, there WAS parking - totally SAFE, too)."
"Friday, September 17th - No reservation - 8:00PM arrival. Was quoted a 30 minute wait time, assured the pager was working at the 45 minute mark, and finally was seated at the 1:20 minute mark. ��People with reservations seemed to be waiting more than 20 minutes past their reservation time. Server splashed hot oil all over my fiancee when he quickly set down one of the pork dishes. Server was inattentive, as we used the same plate the entire meal and only received attention when it was time for the check. The meat was overly salted, and not generally as flavorful as usual. The restrooms both had dirty water stains on the floor, full waste baskets, and few remaining towels. Normally this place does well, but for some reason it was extremely disappointing this night. ��The other nearby steakhou"
"I had to try it. ��I love hot dogs, so I had to do it. ��We drove about an hour to get here, and it was actually worth it! ��What an amazing place."
"We loved this place. Great spot, great idea! The food was even bettertry the logarita or hit up a 40oz"
This is the best tuscan style itialian in the city. ��Has never been a disappointment in 10 years.
"I usually do not write reviews because everyone has their own unique experience but my experience with Brazzaz the other night brought one on. It was on a friday and it wasnt too busy which was good. General decor and ambience was not all that impressive. We were seated and immidiately 3 people came up and began pooring water, taking drink orders and so forth. One of the men pouring our water, i thought was one of the bus boys, but he turned out to be our waiter. We asked for menus and they told us they dont have menus. So we asked what the options were and the cost. Our WAITER: ""ummm what is today, friday.......well the meat meal is 39.50 and if you only want the salad bar its between 25 and 30 bucks. So our waiter wasnt even sure??? Meal then went fine, food was average to above average "
"Anyone complaining about service here must have never been to a real Chinese restaurant. ��Sorry but service is unfortunately not the focus of most Chinese places, instead the food is where the focus is.There are two areas. ��One where you can sit and dine. ��The other where you walk in, attempt to decipher the scribbling on the board and order carry-out right from the cook's window. ��Love to order carry-out cause I can talk to the cooks and see what they like and have them show me where they are cutting from. BBQ pork is fantastic. ��Not too saucy and fatty. ��Lean, deep flavor. ��Just order a combo for two and judge for yourself."
If you want to impress a date and make your money worth while AND you love STEAK. FOGO de CHAO is the spot baby. This is the best steak house in town with a Brazilian concept which I prefer since you could taste variety of Steaks. I have been here numerous times. WARNING! Do not bring a Vegan here; they will be traumatized.
"I'll keep this one short:Great beer selection. ��Tasty menu. ��Impossible to get in, even on a Tuesday. ��Y'all would make more money if your bar eating rules were less awkward. ��How about a bar menu for when I want to eat but it's packed with a two hour wait? ��Also, how about letting me sit in the dining room and drink but not eat for when it's the bar is packed and I want to sit and talk to my companions?If I'm not hungry, I'll go to the Map Room. ��If I am hungry, I'll go somewhere else. ��If it's 4pm, I'll go to Hopleaf.This doesn't read like a four star review. ��Hopleaf really is a pretty sweet place. ��I can't fault y'all for being popular and delicious."
"This place is great. ��It reminds me of the east coast and the drinks are amazing. ��Great atmosphere, not too loud for talking."
There is not much to say other than what others have already. My girlfriend and I make it a must to go at least once a weekend and we have tried everything on the menu.Despite what you think you might want after looking at the menu; do not order anything other than the AHOGADA (extra onions on the side).
This place is a great place to take a date to. The food is delicious and the lighting is perfect. I like getting simple dishes when I go to places like this because I like to see how they can make something typical and simple so deliciousI got the ravioli piccolo sogno. it was delicious! It was beautifully done. A friend of mine ordered the Scaloppine di Vitello. Her words to describe this dish? Mmmmmmm that seemed to be the only words coming out of her during dinner. It was veal cooked in a white wine sauce. That was also beautifully done. This place did a great job with their menu items.
Beef Ribs are the bomb! They also were kind enough to give us a free dessert to celebrate our anniversary.
"Consistently delicious burgers, incredible beer selection, and friendly staff. Very tight, and loud place on a Friday or Saturday evening."
"By far, the best chicagoland pizza place because of their nontraditional crust. For all the suburban folks, another pequod's pizza hidden in the streets of Morton Grove. Good eats and great atmosphere."
I love the rice and black beans with the pork and ��plantines. Wow now thats a good meal. I have to go to the gym for the next couple of days to burn off what I ate.
"Love the thai/sushi option. The delivery is a plus as well and is actually how we found the place. The food itself is solid but nothing mindblowing. Have yet to eat in, only take out and delivery but we plan on going soon. Delivery is super quick and I never do sushi delivery but it has worked out so far with Indie. Keep up the good work!"
"Anteprima is decent, but definitely not a 4 or 5 star restaurant. ��The food's decent, but the staff is very professional. ��I've been here a few times, but I'm having a hard time finding my way back."
"Officially added to my 'go-to' list. ��The staff is extremely friendly, the price is exceptionally reasonable and the food is wonderful! ��The soup is my favorite - chicken noodle - so much delicious food for so little money!The ambiance is nothing to write home about but great food for a great value.I highly recommend."
The restaurant has a great feel to it. Good sit down place. Pizza was great.
"Everything there is excellent. ��A great wine list, fabulous food and great dessert. ��Busy on the weekends but I enjoy the chaos sometimes. ��Has a wait staff second to none. ��Do yourself a favor and go there."
"LOVE this place! One of my favorite spots in Wicker Park. ��Yes, sometimes there's a wait. But the service is mostly excellent +the drinks are not only delicious, but strong."
"Absolutely amazing food! This place rocked my world, and it wasn't the first Brazilian Steakhouse I've ever been to! It was a great place for a fancy city date with my girlfriend at the time. Try it out now!"
"Mmmmm Pequod's. My favorite Chicago-style pizza yet.The caramelized crust is truly a thing to behold. And I love that the pizza is brought out in a cast iron skillet. It was surprising the first time I went there. The environment isn't too great - very much like a sports bar, with multiple TVs showing multiple sports games - but some people are probably way into that. The waitresses all wear the same (weird) uniform, consisting of shorty-shorts and weird hats (I think?), but that didn't really bother me, although my sister-in-law didn't care for it. But the Pequod's salad was great and perfect to split between four people. We got one 14 pizza and had two pieces left over to eat later. Delicious as always.And personally, I'm a fan of this place not only for their good food, but also because"
"Who knew there could be such an authentic taste of Columbia on Chicago's North Lincoln Avenue? ��Las Tablas offers an array of tasty entrees highlighted by the signature dish ""Matrimonio,"" which celebrates the marital bliss of tender steak and seasoned chicken. ��Several seafood options can also be found on the menu. ��Many feature South American style shrimp. ��Each entree is easily sufficient for one person with tasty Columbian favorites yuca and plantains alongside. ��But for a group of four, sharing three of the main courses should leave everyone satisfied. ��The tables outside the restaurant make for an enjoyable evening during the summer, yet they aren't necessarily large enough to hold everyone's small plates along with the entrees. ��Service appears to be acceptable. ��Although in our grou"
"By far the best Chicago-style hot dog I've had, with a fun atmosphere to match! Definitely part of the Chicago experience, make sure you order in your car and don't go in!"
"I don't know why everyone loves it so much. Maybe it's the atmosphere... I tasted their pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket and I must say that it's nothing that I couldn't make in my oven or a crock pot. Even though whole q seems to be sprayed ?with a smokey febreze (that's how I imagined it at least :p LOL) inside, you won't taste any real smoke in the meat. I must say that I was very disappointed with the food I was served, not because it wasn't cooked well, but because it promised to be bbq and it didn't deliver. If you want to taste how the real bbq should taste like visit Smoque BBQ (I absolutely love this place even though I'm not the fan of the atmosphere). If you want to get together in a goldcoast atmosphere (how Jenny H. said), then q is a good choice.Tasting their meat I c"
"I went with friends here for dinner and absolutely loved it. The atmosphere is so relaxed with interesting artwork on the walls. The service was great. the food was great. We ordered a beautiful crocodile roll, a tasty sex on the moon, tom yum kung fried rice, wonderful special items and much more... delicious !Indie is still BYOB, they recently had their liquor license but there is a very tiny corking fee. Indie is definitely our valued restaurant, we also signed up for Indie Diners Club Cards, what's a good deal! ��we won't stop going back for sure."
When it comes to a fresh slice of pizza I want the best. ��So if Chicago pizza is packed I'll drive Art of Pizza into this belly. ��Great friendly service.
"Outstanding! ��We had the regular burger because someone at work recommended it. ��It was probably the best burger I have had in the city, and I know my burgers. ��We added grilled mushrooms to ours. ��The burger fit the bun or the bun fit the burger. ��Know what I mean? ��Oh, and what a great bun! ��I like that the fries and ketchup are in separate serving dishes on your plate. ��I hate when you have to pour ketchup out of a bottle and it runs into other food on your plate. ��The staff was extremely courteous, friendly, and attentive. ��The food arrived in less than 10 minutes and we were not rushed in any way. ��It's a place where you can get in and out in 30 minutes if you have to, but can also linger around if you want to. ��My highlight of the day? ��Seeing Billy's smiling Irish eyes. ��It's always"
Just so happen to stop by this place by mistake and this place is a hidden gem.The food is absolutely amazing you can tell its made fresh and the portions are huge i couldnt even eat all of it.It's a family run restaurant and you can definitely tell that.Even tho this place is totally out of my way I would make a journey to come back here.If I could give more then 5 stars here I would
"I would eat here at least once a week if it was closer to my apartment. This is some of the best sushi in Chicago, the atmosphere is super cute and trendy, and the prices are great. BYOB is definitely a bonus as well!"
"Yummyyy in my tummy. I never heard until my friend brought me. We were seated right away. We both ordered eggs, potatoe, with chorizo !!! One word DELICIOUS!!! The chorizo was so tasty , over easy eggs perfect, & potatoes were my favorite. Deff going back again, again & again !!"
"This is the best pizza in Chicago, possibly the world. They have amazing marinara. The prices are great, the food is ready fast and they have some of the best customer service I've encountered in Chicago.My only complaint is that they should make there dining room more comfortable, but that's okay I'll just eat their pizza in my living room. Thanks for feeding me Art of Pizza! Keep cooking up the cheesy bubbly greatness!"
"I've driven by this place several times and finally got a chance to stop by for dinner. I will definitely be going back -- soon. First, I have to say that the outside looks very cute (which is why I'd always notice it) and the inside is, too. It has cool artwork on the walls and has a laid back feel. They have some great drinks for reasonable prices, like a lychee martini and ginger mojito, I think it was. Now to the sushi. It was fantastic! We ordered 5 different maki rolls, and the green curry, all excellent! It was all fresh, great sauces, and wonderful combinations. I think I have a new favorite sushi place!"
"First of all, I have to say that, in my opinion, Sushi X has the best sushi in the city. ��They have very unique rolls and you get a lot for your money - AND they are absolutely delicious. ��Tonight a friend of mine who used to live in Chicago and is visiting and I ordered sushi that we picked up and brought home. ��When we got home, we realized that even though our reciept had the correct order, they made a mistake and gave us the wrong order. ��We were so dissapointed - but it was late and we were so hungry, so we started to eat what they gave us. ��It was good, but just not what we had ordered and had wanted. ��I called and explained what had happened, and even though we were out of their delivery range, they appologized for the mix up and delivered the 3 rolls that we had orginally ordered. "
"Fogo De Chao is the best place to go if you love meet. My husband and I have been 7-8 times and each time it gets better and better. The staff are great and friendly, they acknowledge you as soon as you walk in. It's my favourite place to go. The endless sewers, especially the amazing picana, the cheese bread and the fried banana are my absolute favorites."
"first of all i would like to say i was referred to brazzaz by a good friend Shelly who also works as a waitress at Brazzaz. at first i was skeptical since i have been to many Brazilian steak houses over the years and only one delivered. from the time me and my brother who is visiting from Houston; walked in to the restaurant the staff was extremely friendly and hospitable. we were seated promptly and always had somebody at our table at our service. we started with the salad bar which at many places has been a disappointment. however the variety and freshness of Brazzaz was overwhelming. it was hard to limit the salad bar to one visit, but we managed. from what i remember the assortments of sushi, ahi tuna, many different types of salads ( green bean salad, my favourite), fresh oysters, man"
"Very fancy.. Take note of that. Ha, anyways, the Bianca Con Rugula was terrible- all cheese, it's seemed like there was no crust on the bottom of the pizza."
I love this place. I want to try every one of the 60 pies. This place is top notch. Great family owned biz.
"The food here was exceptional, so much flavor and depth!"
"Great atmosphere, the servers are nice. The bar next door ""Wangs"" is a great eclectic underground asian bar atmospere."
"What a huge disappointment! ?After reading (mostly) favorable Yelp reviews and having heard it was a good spot, a friend and I tried it for breakfast one weekday morning. ?The service was great, and the place itself is cozy and warm. ?The prices are fairly inflated, but I would not even mention this if the food was worth it. ?Unfortunately, it was not - not by a long-shot. ?(The coffee was good, however.) ?My classic eggs benedict was fairly tasteless: hard muffin, so-so eggs, lousy hollandaise, and ham I could find better at any sandwich joint. ?The accompanying potatoes were lukewarm and tasteless. ?The plate had looked so pretty, though, including a big slice of melon. ? Also tasteless and hard - not nearly ripe. ?I did not finish the dish, and my friend who had a frittata did not finis"
"Thank you Chicago Diner for making a vegan-friendly menu. This place is great. I love that they give you both dairy and dairy-free options. Desserts are wonderful. Even though the place is very popular, the service is always good and you never have to wait too long. One of my favorite restaurants in the city!"
"awesome place, good food and great service. little expensive though. i will come back here if there is any special occasion."
We decided to try this restaurant since it was right off Argyle and Broadway. The selection on the menu was plentiful and it all sounded good. The food tasted good with a lot of flavor. The price was good for the portions that we got. I would recommend going at off peak hours since this place gets packed. But I guess that shows people that the food is good.
"I really wanted to like it here. ��In fact, I did like it here. ��The atmosphere was great and relaxed (although the bathrooms were down in the dungeonlike basement and were very cold). The food was excellent: ��I shared the steamed mussels in white wine sauce and then had the brisket platter. ��The beer list was jaw-dropping, more Belgian ales and microbrews than I knew existed. ��All I could do was pick the first name that I recognized (I had the Ommegang ale; not my favorite beer but it was quite good.) ��One of the most enjoyable moments of the evening occurred when somebody in the table next to us asked for a Bud. ��The waitress didn't quite know how to respond.Which brings me to the killer. ��Our waitress was terrible. ��Now normally, I'm very forgiving of the waitstaff. ��I understand how hor"
"You must go there. We sat in the bar on a Sunday night (have live blues Tues, Thurs, Sun). The food was amazing, service superb, music exceptional. Everything was delicious, but some highlights were the Oysters Rockefeller, Scallops, and Clam Chowder. Best Key Lime Pie we've ever tasted."
"my third review of the night so im not gonna write much lol.quality ingredientsgreat flavorMexican food is good even if the ingredients are not of the highest quality because of all of the flavors compliment eachother at the same time. Also giving each ingredients its own identity if you know what i mean.But frontera really seems to give attention to each ingredient wether it could be using certain techniques to utilize certain ingredients at peak stages (ripe) and taking the time to use these higher quality ingredients to create the pinnacle flavor of mexican cuisine. Surprising to see how they get these ingredients to this level especially in Chicago. Whoever the Chef is, he must care a lot about what he does and i definitely can say im one who appreciates."
"The space is great, the drink selection is too and the food is good but it is way overpriced. ��Everything had a very ""safe"" flavor...nothing particularly striking which is fine except for ��$15 for some entrees you'd really think they'd do a little better.Also, there aren't too many options on the menu."
"I've heard wonderful things about Uncommon Ground, so I decided to finally try it one rainy day at lunch. ��I had the vegetarian chili which was good. ��It wasn't great, but it was certainly was nice enough. ��My boyfriend and I shared the sweet potato fries which were delicious. My experience was just a tiny bit odd, as it was late on a Saturday afternoon and though the restaurant had few people in it, we were sat RIGHT next to a table of four along the wall. ��And the tables were in very close quarters. ��I always just assume that they need to fill certain servers' sections when they do that, but...always a little creepy to kind of be sitting in someone else's lap when there is room in the restaurant to spread out. ��The other weird thing was that there was some kind of kids' band playing real"
"Went for lunch on a beautiful, sunny Friday afternoon.10 minute wait for a table for 2 on the patio.Shared the appetizer sampler (for 2) and the carne asada a la oaxaquena, and a round of drinks (including a margarita that made short work of knocking me on my ass) and got out for around $60. ��Frontera feels like an affordable luxury, something I like to see in restaurant. ��Why make great food if no one can afford it? ��Might not go back because it was kind of just something to say we did, but it was great!"
"Let me start by saying that I'm a fan of all foods Asian, period. However, Vietnamese seems to be the hardest to find in its FINEST form. Not as popular as the ubiquitous Chinese, Thai, and sushi joints, competently executed Vietnamese is a rare treat.First, a few word, the service is perfect, with knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly waitstaff. We just walked into the restaurant without reservations in rush hour last Saturday but they still tried to get for me a table. We waited for a table around 15 minutes while we was drinking lovely hot teas which given from the little owner. After that, foods went out really fast and all of them were so fantastic. I got the Coconut and Mango beef when my husband got the Mahi-mahi which came out after the healthy spring rolls. Mouthwatering good. Ev"
"Fantastic. ��Cannot highly recommend enough. ��BYOB, great location. ��Try the pork sandwich, Simply It Fried Rice, Braised Short Ribs, and the Coconut Mango Beef. ��Quick and friendly service. ��Reasonably price. ��Take out, delivery and dine it. ��Don't miss this place!"
Meat lovers paradise. My husband and I went here for my birthday three years ago and it was fantastic. IF you love red meat then you'll love this place. The salad bar is huge! The meats are juicy and flavorful. The staff was top notch. And they even came out with a special birthday dessert for me- I only wish I had my camera to take a picture. It really was a wonderful time for us. I've gone to Texas de Brazil and find Fogo de Chao less crowded and the staff more attentive.
Yummy the Whoopski is great!
Pizza is good and they have a large beer selection. All in all a good place to come and enjoy a game or just to hang out.
"Great food, great atmosphere, and great staff! I recommend taking your family or your date here, it's amazing!"
"Sunda was recommended by a coworker and found it to be delightfully decadent, fabulous environment, with sexy and mature people. The appetizers, entrees, and desserts were absolutely delicious, full of flavor, simple dishes with a twist, and fully Asian inspired. Also, the General Manager, Aeron and the staff are warm, inviting, and professional. It's definitely a hot spot in River North!"
"Huge Fan of this Place. The meats are amazing and the Salad bar fulfilling and the Service pretty fast. Try the lamb chops and beef ribs; instant Gratification. Goes good with the red wine selection they have there. ��For Desert ��go with the Creme Brulee, and a glass of the champagne."
"Nice ambiance, somewhat of a long wait, similar in style to cheesecake factory. �� The food was OK at best, nicely presented but underseasoned. ��The waiter staff was friendly and professional ."
What a horrible place!! Going there was a very upsetting experience was there ��with a friend upstairs in the open air bar for two hours early afternoon seated at a sofa no service had to get our drinks was not that busy.. a friend was coming to join us would not let them upstairs with empty seats every where nasty manager rude rude I eat out often and entertain will never go back.. this address has been home to several resturants over the years all have closed. I had dinner when it first openend food was so so.. sSalad bar was nasty people saw people taking food from the salad bar with their hands .. The salad bar needs to be monitored.. ��Food at the table was over cooked and cold need I say more..
It was a thursday night and i was on my way home and a friend from work said lets try this nice little place on lincoln called the bad apple so knowing me i said yes and took him up on his offer and went .They had a nice selection of beer ��to choice from.But as far as food i think it could have been a little better.So if you choose to go there be more pepared to drink more than eat.
"In addition to good, affordable food, Wishbone has facilities for business meetings that really impress. ��The bar area doubles as secluded meeting space equipped with a professional projection system that accommodates laptop display, and a separate sound system just for the bar area.We used all the A/V equipment for a monthly creative artists (Second Tuesday every month) meeting and showed two movie shorts on the newly-installed system. ��The response was great!I highly recommend those who are looking for meeting space, especially morning meetings, ��seriously consider this easy-to-get-to North Side location"
"Pros: Ambience, Food, Cons: Service (Food took way toooooooo long), Price. Less Veg option."
"good food, casual, unique menu choices"
"Don't waste your time at Ginos, Unos, or Lou Malnati's. This is the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. Their carmalized crust is unreal. Their sausage is to die for."
"Great food and wonderful, personal service. ��It's so great to see a family restaurant survive, stay true to the original identity and change just enough to stay interesting."
"Basically we were celebrating our first yr wedding anniversary and I am the biggest crab fan and my husband will take me to the best places to eat crab. since we were staying at the Dana hotel downtown, 'SHAWS' was pretty close to it and since its featured item were crabs I could'nt resist. so we got there, and there was valet parking for 12 dollars which we thought was pretty reasonable. so we were made to sit at the bar while waiting on our table. the bar had a pretty interesting menu and the dish that caught my eye was steamed Alaskan crabs with new England clam chowder and 12 oz key lime pie for 34.99dollars which I thought was a good catch. so the bartender asked us if we wanted to order at the bar or at the table. so we told him we wanted to eat at the table...so after 10 mins, we go"
"Love, Love, LOVE Davanti. The food is absolutely unbelievable and the wine selection (and prices) are fantastic. I highly recommend...*Ragu & polenta board*Uovo in Raviolo (incredible, life-changing, amazing)*Swordfish*Pollo Sole Mio*Pork belly"
"So this has always been my favorite gyro spot in greektown but had been extremely disappointed on the rest of their menu on my prior visit. ��Decided that it was worth a second chance since the gyros are just that good and figured that it is typically a pretty crowded restaurant so maybe I just got a bad experience. ��Turns out I am very glad that I went back a second time. ��The lamb dishes were fantastic, the meat just slipped easily off the bone and was very tender. ��The grilled octopus was also a very good appetizer with just the right amount of smokeyness. ��And of course the gyros were as good as I remembered. ��Overall a solid choice for Greek food and glad that I gave it another chance."
"I went to San Soo Gab San last Tuesday. When we just get in the restaurant, there are only less people there but they give us a table which is so close to the door, and it's so cold that day. I don't know if we are not Korean, so the waitress becomes so rude. They were never come back after they gave us the food. ��I need to say the foods are really good and they have a lot of sides."
"Nice place to come for lunch - I've been here many times for their huge lunch buffet. ��Good variety, a little something there for everyone - great place to come with coworkers or a group of friends.I always have the naan and the chicken tandoori - very good."
"Best spot in Chicago hands down........u can actually taste the hard work, and the willing to please in the food no joke........I been here like 9 times already go like once a month now."
"Many thanks to Angel S. for the tips in her review! ��She was definitely right on, and if we hadn't followed them we would have too full to eat some of the best meats they brought. ��What a pleasant night! ��The manager is wonderful, the servers some of the best in all of Illinois, and the bartender makes a great drink. ��It's a bit on the pricey side, but definitely worth every penny that you pay. ��You'll feel like a celebrity after leaving, they treat you that well."
"This place has great pizza, But you have to pay for it. I mean. It ain't cheap. ��What is better though is their beer. ��We get a growler every time we are there. ��Well done.Just make sure you get there early. IT can take two hours to get seated. ��Put your reservation in and then take a walk around the neighborhood."
"I could eat here everynight and I would if I had the money and could eat whatever I wanted all the time! The chopped salad is so good- the best salad I've ever had. Some of my other favoties include the cocounut crusted shrimp, the halbut (yummmm) and the steak is great too."
"I recently had a chance to eat at The Pig, a new restaurant on the Mag Mile. Tucked off the street, the entrance found inside what looks like an office building, the sign boasts: Cheese, Swine, and Wine. The interior is small but well appointed, sporting large community tables and a marble bar overlooking the bustling open kitchen. I took a seat at the bar and proceeded to peruse the rather impressive menu. The menus sports categories for Antipasti, Fried Items, Entrees, Salads, Cheeses, Charcueterie, and an item they call Shmears. The wine list came in a small booklet, almost like a 3-ring binder, with pages that look like they could easily be replaced or updated, always a good sign in a place that professes to take wine seriously. I was quite hungry and ordered accordingly.Pork Liver Pat"
"Of all the Asian restaurants in Boystown (and that's no small number), this one has by far the best sushi. ��Then again, that's pretty much all they have so if you don't like raw fish you're SOL. ��And they get ubercrowded after 7:30 on weekends, so it's hard to just drop by if you feel like sushi on a Saturday night. ��But their sushi quality is top notch, and not any more overpriced than you'd expect."
"WORST KOREAN RESTAURANT EVER. WORSE than Seoul garden and same level as jangchoongdong.Here are the foods i ordered today Food : 0 - half stars. Spicy chicken - has no flavor to it . Tagui gamjatang (beef/potato soup) - taste like some kid scooped one teaspood of chilli pepper sauce in to the water . Gulbi (fish) - so soooo big but has nothing to eat- seafood pancake : 3stars - it was crispy and had some seafoods but the sauce was too salty i ended up not eating them but not bad!Side dish: 1starsso many yelp reviewers were stunned by so many side dishes.i went there today at 11. Seaweeds were dried, looked like fries Yes, There are many but how many side dishes do you ask those ladies to bring more? none. I asked for pickled sliced radish because my chicken had no flavor and i had to eat w"
"i went to costa rica and came back with the strongest cravings for the amazing meals i had there.thankfully, i don't have to go very far to satisfy them. i also don't have to go very far to purchase my favorite condiment of all time: salsa lizano.the wait staff is incredibly nice and accommodating. the one time my order was semi-incorrect, they handled it so well, i kind of want to lie and say they messed up every time (kidding).drinking their horchata is like suckling milk from heaven's teat. nbd."
We went for our anniversary and the whole package was amazing. The atmosphere was little dark but I wanted romantic so no complaints there. Romantic dinner + Flamenco guitar music + 2 bottles of wine = a healthy reward for the hubby. ��;-) Good job babe!
"As an avid traveler, I am a huge fan of trying new foods. Living near Chicago, it is never hard to make it to some of the top restaurants the city has to offer. Frontera Grill is hands-down my favorite Mexican restaurant and one of my favorite restaurants of all of the countries I've eaten food in. Aside from the Rick Bayless factor, the restaurant does not disappoint except for one factor. Reservations. This highly reputable restaurant does not take reservations and the lunch rush during the workweek wraps around the block at times. Now that I'm done complaining about that, I can go on to describing this insanely delicious experience. There is nothing I love more than chips, salsa, and guacamole. At Frontera, you are greeted with the freshest made guacamole with seasonings straight from M"
"My daughter and I were staying at the Hotel Indigo when at 10:00pm we decided we needed something sweet to eat . ��Two doors down we found this amazing cafe. ��The staff was wonderful, inviting us in like we were old friends. Janet, the owner suggested the raspberry scone, it was served warm with whipped cream and melted butter, truly delightful and the cafe latte was a perfect addition. ��As we nibbled away Janet joined us making it even more enjoyable. ��Normally I would want to keep this wonderful little spot to myself, but you just must try it!!!"
"the food was horrible, the only thing good about the place was its decor. i went with a group of friends and we spent over a grand there and the meat tasted like the lowest class of cuts. NOT IMPRESSED, dried and not much of a selection and wow 44 buck per person and you have to order the sides seperately"
"Food - ExcellentDecor-ExcellentService- Comes with horrible attitude. ��Hostess actuall threw herself on the hostess podium in a dramatic ploy for us to leave. ��Such a shame, besides the staff everything else is great. ��If you don't like customer service, get out of the business!"
"My wife and I eat a lot of Thai food and Opart is right at the top. ��The food tastes fresh. ��I love the spring rolls and pad thai. ��The green curry is great, but a little hot for me so I get extra rice and all is good. �� I could eat there every day."
"I must agree with the majority of these reviews. Yeah, the food is awesome ..... well priced, the food, drinks & service was tops . This place does some great business. What more can you say .  A bit on the ''hole in the walI '' style type restaurant but will only complain about the bathrooms. A bit more upkeep goes a long way, hence only four stars instead of five. �� Thanks."
"Warning: Egg puns may be present.Once upon a time, in a not too-far-off distant land, a breakfast place was located down Michigan Avenue. ��Heck, with it being a Wednesday morning (1030ish to be exact), Yolks seemed like a lovely little place to visit and not have to worry about a long wait. ��Bright blue and yellow walls were present, and even some abstract d��cor littered each table. ��Clearly, I thought, this place has to be the shiznit of breakfast places especially since the moment my beloved and I walked into this place, it made me feel like I was in a carton of eggs. ��Boy, was I sadly mistaken. ��After the hostess seated us, our waiter appeared from the mass of waiters and waitresses loitering near the front of the store. ��Our order (my companion ordered some banana-crepe thingy with a s"
"this place is a classy joint and they make a killer martini. but some nights they have shitty poetry readings and other live music, which doesnt fit this type of place at all, and they shush the crowd. what the fucks up with that? its not the fucking symphony in here. people want to chat while they get their entertainment at a bar. i think its under new ownership or something because i feel like this is a more recent thing. ��if they would just cut the bull shit this place would be one of my favorites."
Greatest place ever!!!!!!!!! Their pizzas and artopitas are to die for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I go there every weekend! Thats my new spot - thats how AMAZING this place is !
A family restaurant with great Vietnamese food. The service was fantastic. Did NOT miss not having alcohol. Indulge in their smoothies - they were delicious. Would DEFINTELY go there again.
"Best Veggie Patty I've ever had...I've been vegan, Veggie, and occasionally eat burgers now, and this veggie burger is phenomenal. ��Staff is nice, beer is good and it's a good speed all around. Get it!"
This one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. The veggie burrito is awesome. Order it with plantain inside. Yum.
"First a few things:IF you want to go to a namesake Indian restaurant and get ripped off for eating there then you might think of this place. Next IF you want to go and figure out that that is not how anyone would cook, you would surely visit this place.This is no where near authentic Indian food. I bet the chef is not Indian. The flavors were so off... like the vegetable jalfrezi had too much vinegar in it. My husband who usually is incapable of recognizing flavors was also able to pick out the fault.Lets just say we ate because it was late at night, had a groupon and both of us were hungry and we would have eaten anything edible then.Please dont be fooled into thinking that this is authentic Indian food!!"
"Yummmmmm....I got the meat loaf and it was everything that I would've hoped it to be. At first I was a little hesitant because seitan meat loaf doesn't sound very appetizing, but it was great. It has lentil and what appeared to be carrots ground into it. SO good. I've also had the avocado tostados and they were also to die for. They have so many options both vegetarian and vegan, everything that a long time vegetarian has been missing."
"yummy!! this place has the best everything. i live a few blocks away so i've eaten here many, many times. i've never had the same thing twice and every dish has been awesome. the wheat grass smoothie is SOOO good. the lunch menu is great, too."
"I have been to Zed 451 several times for drinks and the rooftop however this time I was really disappointed and I don't think I would go back or recommend it. ��I went to dinner with Bachelorette Party (9 girls) and once the server realized that we were not interested in the ""Zed Experience"" since most didn't want such a large meal, he started treating us so rudely! On top of that we waited over an 1h and 20m for hour food and between that time never came by to check on us on drinks nor update us. We order simple items off the menu like salad and flat breads. ��When the food finally arrived it was half wrong, some were so cold we had to send them back and he forgot one dish completely. ��One of the girls got her food after everyone was done. We did speak to a manager during the meal because o"
"I am a big fan of this place. ��The kabobs are great, with kudos to the chicken shawerma and lamb dishes. ��I am baffled about how they keep this place so cheap! ��I would have given it 5 stars, but I place some blame on them for next day GI distress after going there near closing on a weeknight."
"I recently visited Irazu for the first time (along with my family) and I can definitely say nobody left disappointed. ��We started off with the chips, of course; I can't offer comment on them, as I was saving my appetite for what I knew was going to be a delicious course. ��This turned out to be a wise move. ��The dishes, although very reasonably portioned, do contain a lot of food. ��I ordered the potato taco plate. ��The tacos themselves were nothing to write home about (through no fault of Irazu's; it's just not a particularly exciting dish), but everything else was great. ��The rice was perfectly seasoned; the cabbage salad had a lovely zing to it; and I have nothing to compare the plantains to, but they offered a pleasant new taste I'm not familiar with- as many have said before, somewhere "
This place serves up Thai that is a cut above the usual. The pad kee mao was spiced to perfection and presented well. My dining companion raved about the seafood salad and sushi.
Sat at the bar and enjoyed mid-afternoon apps and drinks last weekend. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable of specials. Margaretta was awesome! Will definitely go back.
"Sunda's service is wonderful. ��There food is delicious. ��We went on a Saturday night...around 5:30PM. ��The place was quiet and we had a great conversation...by 6:30PM...it was wall to wall people and very loud.If I had any complaint it would be the noise level when the place is full. ��All hard surfaces. ��It would be great if there was some acousitc work done there.However, it was still super and we had a new waiter...who was great. ��We would definitely go back again...maybe not on a Saturday night....maybe Tuesday or Wednesday around 5:00PM...we liked the quiet!"
"My partner and I try to eat here every time we are in Chicago. On our most recent trip (early May), we were too late to sneak in for dinner without a reservation, so we sat at the bar and ordered. The bartenders were both talented and pleasant and even though they were exceptionally busy, explained what they were making. That was great fun.The seasonal sangria was excellent. We had several appetizers, the Verdosa salad (always yummy), roasted cauliflower, the padron peppers (the dressing on these is fantastic), and a butternut squash dumplings. We had a lovely light dining experience. If we were new to the restaurant, I would have needed and appreciated the guidance of a server, but as it worked out, I couldn't have been happier."
"Good place to eat if you are a glutten! ��If you are not eating a lot, probably not worth the trip."
"I don't get the hype. ��The dogs are OK, the fries are substandard. ��The car-hop service is kind of cool as a throwback, but the service is slow and inconvenient. �� I like hot dogs, but don't see what's so special other than the cool hot dog man out front."
"There are plenty of great pizza places in the city and until recently I thought Gino's was one of them. ��Dont bother going here, the staff, especially the management, was so rude and condescending that it left my mother in tears. ��In a town that is known for its pizza, choose a place that not only makes great pizza, but also makes you feel welcomed as their guest. ��STAY AWAY!!!"
"A special occasion place for us, worth every penny for the unpretentious staff, amazing culinary delights, and of course time with your sweetie over dinner! Really remarkable and inventive cuisine, the menu designs were whimsical and fun- it had authenticity and personality on the plate. Save up and go wild with the seasonal menu."
"Great food, good service, but it was noisy and also a bit pricey for the portion sizes (yes I know tappas are small plates)."
"Good food, a little pricey but worth it. You will enjoy yourself."
"Just Grate Steak!!!!They made us wait for 45 min,but than they comp apps 25$ and 25$ for drinks,nice of them,but after that I didn't see the manager any more I didn't need too because food was so good,we had porterhouse steak for 2 and lobster mash potato ��it was spot on,5 stars for food!!We both bottle of wine at the bar so server didn't care about us any more,again she didn't have to but if you spend 300$ for diner I was expecting little bit better service!!!Over all I will be back!!!"
Can't get here enough! ��Vegan Nirvana!
Recently I have visited Grand Lux Cafe. It's awesome you know. I ��must say the qualty of that resturant is really great. I'v become a fan of it. The ambiance was great in my opinion. I love that.
Two words: Steak bowl. ��Go get yourself one NOW!
"Garcia's has great food at a great price! Can't be in the area and not stop for a steak burrito. If you gotta have great Mexican food, you gotta have Garcia's."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants. ��I am big on restaurant appearance, cleanliness and presentation of food. ��They score 10+++.The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and definitely Grand. ��The location and views are excellent for those in downtown Chicago. ��The menu is Grand, and every option is available Grand in size. ��The staff are always good but can be a little too fast paced or appearing as though they don't have a second to spare. ��Although, I'm very petite, when I like something... I love it... and don't like to be slighted, so I love there portions. ��You don't feel slighted in the portions when it comes to appetizers, drinks or your entree. ��Most often, you're full before your entree if you order an appetizer. ��I am always guaranteed to take some home with me and rarely make "
"Great authentic food, friendly staff, no complaints. The place is a bit small but I never felt like I was overcrowded in there, in makes for a nice intimate environment with friends or family. Besides when it's warmer out they have outdoor seating, but regardless once you taste the food I doubt anything else would matter.off top, my favorite items on the menu is their Ceviche, I also like their onion steak, and their finger licking Tostones with the warm authentic homemade warm fresh garlic sauce (when they delivered it once the sauce was cold, not as good though)They are one of my favorite go to spots in Chicago, I recommend."
Delicious! One of my favorite restaurants!
"Hot dogs were decent, But they didn't have much else on the menu, Growing up in Chicago I need options to stimulate my visit and return, Doug's isn't worth a hour long wait, Not worth traveling for, Way too many options in the city."
Went here Sunday morning before heading back to Houston and the food was great. There was a variety of unique items to choose from but I tried the banana nut bread french toast topped with bananas and a side of peanut butter. It was awesome! The only drawback about this place was the wait (45 min) but it was well worth it.
"Classic Chicago experience. ��There will be a line and you will most likely have to wait, but it is a memorable experience."
"The hot dogs are good but I had such high expectations for this place that it was a big disappointment. My hot dog was not hot, and I had to ask twice for a new one. It was extremely busy and we waiting outside for half an hour. However, I think it was an off day and I'm going to give it another try."
"Best Breakfast Ever!!!So, you will have to wait to get a table and the service will most likely feel a little rushed to those accustomed to sitting around and chatting after their meal. But for me and E it's total worth it. We go here as a regular treat on Sundays when we aren't trying out new places for breakfast. ��Me and E have become eggs benedict connoisseurs and their varieties are always a crowd pleaser with some interesting variations that include crab cakes, salmon, and avocado. Don't miss out on their smoothie and juice bar. They have smoothies that put Jamba juice and orange Julius to shame. Everything is super fresh and homemade even their cornbeef hash which is something you don't often see. I am a savory kind of guy myself but their banana and nutella crepe is remarkable. You "
"For $35.00 per person, you can't beat the price for the quality of the food. A 3 course dinner. Cool wine retreval system."
"I went to Las Tablas with a large group and it was a great atmosphere. ��The waiter was attentive and the plantains were AMAZING!! I had read top notch reviews regarding the steak so I decided to give it a go. ��Unfortunately, I was not blown away. ��To be fair, I'm not much of a steak person, but it seemed a bit dry and flavorless. ��Overall great experience though and I tried my friend's stuffed chicken which was really good."
"We had Nana cater our office holiday party, and it was superb. We asked for a meat tray, a veggie tray, a cheese tray, and some desserts, and what we got was very agreeably out of the ordinary and quite reasonably priced, especially considering the quality of ingredients and preparation. We're planning on having Nana cater our next event; you should too!"
Pretty good burgers. It's the Kumas that doesn't give you food poisoning. Their pretzel rolls are the best! My girlfriend each got our own burgers. We should have only gotten one because they are so huge. The only negative was the small appetizer. Cheese Curds were a bit soggy. But pretty good burgers and a great beer selection.
"My husband and I went here for the first time 4 years ago (Dec 2009). ��We went on a cold December night and were fortune it enough to have had made reservations in advance. ��The place was packed but we were seated fairly quickly. ��We were even fortune it enough to be there on a night when Rick himself was there. ��He was nice enough to sign a book for my husband. ��I had their signature steak, plantains and black beans. ��This dish was AMAZING!!! ��At the beginning of this year I knew I would ��be going back to Chicago in March and tried to make reservations. ��They said they only ��took so many reservations and that I would need to come in as a walk in. ��So, my husband and I went there on a Saturday night (March 2012) and stood in the overcrowded bar for THREE hours and were never seated. ��We le"
eh.... not very impressive. Too ordinary for a vibrant dining city.
"Great place for food and drinks. I don't know if it was because I was drunk but those fries were delish! Good neighborhood place. Love sitting outside, friendly staff, decent prices. If you're in the hood, check em' out!"
"A few months ago, my husband and I took some out of town friends here after driving past a few other nearby places with lines out the door. Boy, did we make the right choice... the food delicious, the service just fine, and the friends left full and impressed at our selection. My husband had the chicken & waffles, and the chicken was honestly some of the best I've had. I had the stuffed french toast (amazing), and one of the out of town friends had a duck dish. She commented to me just the other day that she still thinks of that meal!"
my son inlaw took me out for dinner there all i have to say about the place is if you don't go there it is your mistake. you are missing out on a great dinning exp.iI would go there once a week if not more if i could. i wish they had one in northwest IN.the waiters and food is some of the best i had in a long time. the salad bar is to die for.i had a great time.So do not take my word for it go and have a great exp. for your selfand exp. the time of your life
You need to call in advance to get the suckling pig. But it is all worth it! Anybody that brings me a suckling pig cooked perfectly with the head still on is gonna get five stars. GOD......my mouth is watering now thinking about it. ��I felt like a caveman a loved every minute of it! HAHAHA
Awesome! and that coffee kicks ass!
"The best duck I've ever had. Great food for your buck. You can fill up on a $5 plate. I regret not trying the fried rice. The servers were bringing them out in these huge plates and they looked so good. Their service could use some improvement. Staff all looked stressed and over worked. Which is inderstanble considering how packed the place was even an hour before closing. All in all, I will definitely go back. You can't beat $30 for 3 people."
The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is the decor and the food was good.They overcharged my credit card $53 and I called and they said if I had my receipt they could help. Does anyone seriously keep their receipts unless they are traveling on business? No. Too bad I won't be coming back. Very disappointed!
"By far my favorite restaurant. the food, the drinks, the people. ��Doesn't get any better than Sabatino's. Authentic Italian food with a touch of flare. Love it, Love it Love it."
I have been to most of all the top rated burger spots around Chicago and after reading a few recent reviews I finally made it to Lockdown. ��I really wish I had visited this place earlier and wasted less time in line at Kuma's. ��The service was fantastic and the burgers were outstanding and my GF loved her salad and devoured my side of Mac & Cheese. �� I had the The Federales and was hands down the best burger of my life and can't wait to try more.Beer list was as good or better than most bars and we enjoyed watching the Hawks game while listening to some metal. ��Patio is opening soon and we will be back
This is my must go to restaurant when in Chicago. ��I love the atmosphere as soon as you step in the place. ��I usually choose to sit at the bar next to the pass so you can see all the dishes going out. ��I have yet to have a dish I have not liked. ��My all time favorite is the Crispy Pig Ears with the fried egg on top. ��Sounds weird but I can't get enough of that dish. ��The Bone Marrow is a must try. ��Also the Beets with Goat Cheese is a great way to start. ��This place is out of control good. ��I have been there 3 times during my last two trips to Chicago. ��Perfect for the late night bite too. ��Not sure I want too many people to find out about this place it is already really busy so my selfish side is saying I shouldn't post this.
I do love wishbone. We hope across the street quite regularly and have never been let down. I would say that other than the great omelette's I've had I always enjoy the homemade black bean burger. That is a great burger! Cheers.
"Now this is how I imagine kalbi is supposed to be. ��The meat was lean and had an amazing flavor, helped along by a smokiness from the grill. ��Our server was attentive and refilled the little dishes a couple of times since we couldn't get enough of them. ��The potato thing was fantastic and went well with the kalbi. ��Excellent food, good service, and good price, that's what I like."
"This food was amasing, I love this place, will go again"
"Excellent!!!The BYOB concept makes this restaurant very unique and great for dates or groups. ��Their jalapenos soup is the best I have ever had. ��Our waiter was excellent and attentive but not annoying. ��I'm not from Chicago, but would highly recommend this place to anyone in the Chicago area."
"This place is cute! ��I am a brunch connoseiur so that's a lot coming from me. ��I live in the Wicker Park area yet never went here before, and decided to one hungover morning on Milwaukee. ��The service was good and the eggs were cooked perfectly....the atmosphere was different, cute also. ��We went on a Tuesday which made it a very spacious, intimate little experience. ��Oreo pancakes looked good but I didn't try them."
There food was way salty the last time I visited.
"I'm a huge pho fan and this place was just a total let down!The pricing is right but the food is just terribly bland, yuck, and just EW!Here's an example, my pho tasted just like chewy beef in hot water and noodles. The broth had absolutely no flavor to it! I also sampled some of my friend's entrees, again very flavorless in everything. It might look good but don't let it fool you, it's not that great.Would I come back here? no. I've sampled better pho from lesser known places. Actually, I'm ��not even sure why this place is so busy, probably because it's on a corner but the food does not live up to what some of these customers are saying.."
"My husband and I go to Doug's more or less weekly, now. ��We generally get whatever is on special and something else. ��We go at the off hours and haven't waited for more than 20ish minutes yet.But we have not gotten to try the duck fat fries. ��We don't go when they're on, as we know it'll be a madhouse. ��Someday."
"My husband and I really enjoy the food at Yolk and have been here several times because its in our neighborhood. ��The wait on the weekends is tough but worth it once you get in. ��On their menu they advertise their ""fresh squeezed"" juices (orange, orange strawberry and grapefruit). ��During our wait today, we saw the waiters pouring that ""fresh"" juice out of big food service gallon jugs. ��This is pretty crappy practice especially since they charge an arm and a leg for this juice. ��I would recommend Yolk for the large menu and tasty food but watch out for the ""fresh"" claims on the juice."
"I have been really wanting to come here and glad to have the chance. I brought a business client with me and we had a phenomenal experience. The service was great, dishes innovative and the atmosphere lovely. Pricey but worth it."
"Went here for brunch on a Saturday. Ambience is pleasant but the food leaves more to be desired. Latte - was brought out coldCornbread muffins - dry but the accompanying butter was good. Cheddar corncakes - bland and flavorless. The redeeming dish was the Gumbo. The waitress ""warned"" me that it was dark and slightly bitter but it was really good. That would be the only dish that I might go back for."
Best Indian in the city. ��Love their lamb chops. Good crowd and good decor.
"Extremely disappointed! Got a gift certificate for our anniversary, was unable to get a reservation (6 ��weeks in advance) for Topolobampo. Arrived at 5pm on Saturday, waited in line 20 minutes to put our name on the wait list. The hostess quoted 2-2.5 hour wait. Checked with the hostess after two hours and fifteen minutes and she told me it would be another 30 minutes. Total wait 3 hours, still no table. ��Had three drinks (two down the street at Flemings) and left without eating because by then we weren't hungry. Totally disappointing special occasion. Wouldn't know how great the food is..."
"Yummy Yummy Yummy!I can't believe I've never eaten here before?!I went here with a friend one day, and we both got the Hot Doug and split cheese fries.Its so hard to rate a 'hot dog place' but this is not just any hot dog place.The charred dogs will keep me coming back for more, and I am very pleased I finally ate here!"
"Really good food, alot of it, and reasonably priced. Plus we got to bring our own bottle of wine! (there is a corkage fee). The only downside is the ambience itself--the floors ceiing and walls are all hard surfaces (tile, marble) and sound carries a lot in here. Can feel a little like a cafeteria."
great food and great ambience! the location across the street was a lot smaller but the food tasted better.. :(
"Had a reservation for New Years Eve, and everything was Great! Server was very nice, and recommended the KC strip-great choice as it was awesome!Fun time downtown on N E Eve, and can't go wrong with Ruth's Chris!"
This place sucks! The food sucks and the vibe is even worse. Do yourself a favor and go to Boundary or Cans if you are looking for a sports bar in the hood.
Our favorite local Thai. ��Good atmosphere. ��Try the Red Snapper.
"One of my favorite places in the city!!! If you haven't been....GO!!! Their food is amazing and best of all it's byob! ��FYI, They only take reservations for 6 or more. ��Enjoy!"
"I've been here a couple of times, one thing for sure, the fish is awesome. Arctic char w/ the shrimp, drooling just thinking about it. Good walleye and delectable mahi mahi. only reason i give it 4 stars instead of 5, inconsistent service. It's up in the air whether i'll see my server more than twice. Have experienced awesome service with no complaints. Then i've had a time when beer was spilt all over my feet and shoes, by the server, and it took her about 15minutes to bring me some extra napkins- i went in to get them myself before she brought them out. but always great food!"
Cory approved.
"I think the Sushi and Thai combination is a little wore out in Chicago, however Indie Cafe pulls it off quite well. The only problem I had was with the dinning area, it was really small and you practically are sitting in you neighbors lap. ��Aside from the seating the Thai Curry was great and my husband had some very good and imaginative sushi dishes. Indie Cafe offers delivery, which will be how I eat with them again considering my distaste of the dinning are. ��I would recommend this place to anyone!"
SLOW service! Server showed irritation that we had a large number of people in our party and showed no interest in getting anything to us in a timely manner. It seemed he wasn't concerned with making our table a priority since we would have automatic gratuity added to our bill. There were five tables that were sat after us that got their food long before we did. We had to ask twice for water and finally got water an hour and a half after we were sat. One person ordered a soda and it was not brought to the table until an hour later and that was after they were reminded. All in all we were in their establishment for almost three hours and only actually eating for about a half hour of that time. The staff was rude when we requested anything and as best was unable to attempt to assess any need
"the places it's great atmosfere ,decoration employees very nice and polite but the food it's terrible try to resemble cuban food! not even close could be a gourmet food not even the portions are miserable!! too salty , the meet taste old thit no consistency! the adobo it was no were to be found on my pork, the short ribs for my husband really he can make a taco that big was the portion,! unfortunally i would not recomend the place to any of my friends ��the food in general !!!OVER PRICE$ ! ��i hope they can improve the cuisine!! ��or change the chef !!"
"I'll keep this short and simple. Too much going on in all the dishes. I want to taste my PIG, not have it hiding in flavors. Everything we ordered looked better than it tasted. This only means one thing, they are trying to hard to be somebody there not. The pig is my favorite animal to eat and they ruined it for me. If your materialistic and want to be fooled, go here. If your smart and you know your pig, you'll know where to go. Simplicity is the best and The Purple Pig is not. Two stars because the staff was nice, otherwise one star for the food."
"Wow...can't say enough great things about La Villa! We have been patrons for several years now. I know for us, what keeps us coming back is the service, the atmosphere and most importantly the food! We have used their banquet halls for two large events and both were very well organized and unforgettable. This week they are celebrating their 40th year in business and they pulled out everything to celebrate. ��They rolled back the prices on selected items and have amazing entertainment all week long (we were lucky to see the talented Tim Fett this past Tuesday). The portions are VERY generous too, so go hungry. ��The ribs are so tender they fall off the bone, the Chicken Francese is very delicious and the New York Strip steak is heavenly. Chris and Sam go out of their way to make sure you have"
Place has lots of side dishes. But that's about it. The beef is of the poorest quality. ��It is just plain horrible. ��Have been going to this place on and off over 10 years and it only gets worse. Anywhere else is better than here. Can not believe they are still open and even open another location in Niles. ��They are fooling all the non Koreans to going here. Do not waste your time this place just sucks.
"BEST EVER dining experience! ��My bff who is Cuban suggested 90 Miles, she sold me w/how awesome the service was and told us ( my future husband and I) to look out for a girl named Margarita to serve us! ��Lucky for us she was our server for the night!!! ��We absolutely loved her! ��Outgoing personality and took care of us like GOLD! ��So much so, we're possibly planning to have our pre engagement party there! ��Margarita you ROCK!"
"WORST SERVICE IN THE HISTORY OF RESTAURANTS. Maybe if i was Korean, i'd have better service. Four of us ventured to this place, and none of us had been there before. No one greeted us, we were just sat. it took 15 minutes(at least) for someone to come and take our drink orders. and longer for us to get her to come back to the table. Then a lady (who looked way too busy to help us, and had the attention span of a 3 year old) asked us what we wanted. As started with the ....""we've never been here before....yadda yadda"", she didn't say a word and left our table and came back again. What? Really? So, by then, we knew we wouldn't get good service, so we ventured on our own...and ordered.Everything tasted like it was swimming in vinegar. The steak was good, but so is the steak I buy at Jewel for"
"I have only written 5 star reviews so far, I think, and nothing changes with Mayan Palace..It's like to restaurants in one..You have the quiet area, you see when you walk by, and then a huge beer garden area you can't see. ?Just love the food we have had and the drinks..Prices are fair, portions are great, and worth the $$$ to go out..We prefer that beergarden, even this time of year it's great..The owner is there a lot, and the staff is cool.Fresh quacomole is excellent as well..This isn't just another Mexican place. ?Truyly, a hidden gem to most folks in Linoln Park and Lakeview..Check it out"
"Home Run! This place is great. I have been there several times for date night. The service is great and the food is great as well. The pasta is excellent, I am a fan of the steak as well. Highly recommended!"
"I went to Icosium Kafe' after seeing it on Check Please.It's small, but has a nice cozy feel, but the music was a bit annoying.The waitress was attentive without being overbearing.I had the Chicago crepe....I thought it was ok, it had way to many sun dried tomatoes.....I got the vegetable so to go along with it and the soup was pretty good. I also had a nutella crepe and that was amazing.I will be making a return trip to Icosium Kafe' but only for dessert."
"This is such a great place. They have delicious homemade pasta. I have been here twice and both times I got the veal meatballs. They were large and super tender. My family went crazy over their pumpkin ravioli, it is the best pumpkin ravioli I have ever tried. Their desserts were delicious as well, with a hazelnut (I think) panna cotta, as well as the tiramisu. But to top it off, and the reason they absolutely get 5 stars in my book, is that I just received a card in the mail from them. I had filled out my information on a card at the restaraunt last time I visited, and I just received a handwritten thank you note from the chef, along with a gift certificate to come back and use! I have never had a restaraunt do that unless it was my birthday, so I think this really shows how much they val"
"I really like this pizza place/ brewery. The pizza is a delicious thin crust, my fav. And they offer a New Haven style that I love. The craft beers are awesome. I love worryin ale, camel toe, dysfunction ale, as well as many others. It's really hard to go wrong with anything here. Only reason it isnt 5 stars is that its a bit expensive and it is impossible to get in on a weekend."
"Here is what matters about Xoco, the food is A. mazing. ��Seriously. ��It's insane. ��The mushroom torta. The ahogada. The chocolate modelo ice cream (please bring it back, it was like a little piece of heaven!). Yes, the way you have to line up is annoying. Yes there is very little table space. ��But the food more than makes up for it. ��It's so good, in fact, that my family and I now make 2 trips a year to Xocago that involve (quite literally) nothing but eating at Xoco for 2 days straight. ��Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. ��If you stay at the Residence Inn down the block you can get in for breakfast at opening, come back for a late lunch around 2, go to the piano bar around the corner from 6-9:45, and make it back in time for a late dinner before their 10pm closing. ��All without ever leaving a "
"Long wait to get in, usually a good sign.Service wasn't very good.Portions are very large and they are pretty pricey.The food wasn't that good. Pita Inn is FAR better, at a fraction of the cost.I had the Soltani, which is a combination of Barg and Koubideh. I added Chenjeh kabab to the combo. Very disappointed in all three of them. I could have gone to a steakhouse and had much better results than the meal presented to me at Noon O Kabab.Ordered the Dolmeh for my gf, and it was good. She had a vegetarian meal, Adass Polo, with chick peas and rice. It was alright. Kind of bland, but better than the kababs I ordered. If Kabab is in the name of the restaurant, it should be better than a vegetarian option on the menu - it should be the best thing on the menu.Large portions of subpar food isn't"
"Experience - Dined here 1st time on restaurant anniversary. ��Will not return as Italian food is not hard to do, and there are plenty of neighborhood options. ��See management comment below.Food - Tastes ok, Decent size portionPrice - fairWait Staff & Management - patrons were offered to put their name on a special drawing for the anniversary. ��Management did not offer us any concession, even when they found out our name was vehemently left out of the drawing.Wait time - lousy - especially for middle of week early dinner. got put on wait list at 6pm, didn't get seated till 7:30, got appetizer at 8:10.Environment - noisy"
"Went here for the first time last night and had such an excellent experience!I was meeting my friend for dinner at 6 and unfortunately, I didn't get there until 6:30. ��They were great at the front, held the table and were very quick to accomodate us (even though the place was packed). ��Our server was great too - we didn't feel rushed and she gave us great recommendations when we asked as well!Definitely can't beat the people watching! ��Was almost hard to concetrate on the converstation cuz there was so much going on around you - but entertaining, none the less.Food/wine are definitely a little pricey, but everything we had was absolutely delicious and so different from what you see at other places.Highly recommend the following...Rock Shrimp TempuraFirecracker RollThe Number Ten RollCrispy"
"The Roast Duck is very, very, very good and when you dip it in the sauce that it comes with, you're talking about a powerful combination. WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!- Will Robinson, Lost In SpaceThe moment you eat there you're ADDicted!Remember Kids: Say no to drugs and yes to Roast Duck!"
"Giordanos is a very good pie! Consistency is good.. always busy as heck there. If you are a tourist and want to say you had a ""real"" Chicago pizza go there."
"If I was rating this place solely on the food I would give it 4.5 stars. ��My food was very fresh and tasty and love that this place is local and right in the heart of Greektown. ��However, since I have to factor in customer service that takes it down a few notches.I realize the waiting space is cramped and in order to cut down on that they give you a beeper and send you a few doors down for complimentary coffee. ��That's fantastic. However, if the hostess tells you 30 minute wait, that sometimes means 1 hour and 20 minutes. ��I realize it's a busy place but after approaching her after the 1st hour wait to make sure she didn't accidentally overlook us. She seemed annoyed and completely unapologetic for the extra wait time. ��So after finally getting seated we meet our waitress who also seems li"
"My family loves LaVilla!We discovered it years ago and have had just about every major family celebration there since. Wedding anniversary, baby showers, graduations, Super Bowl parties, you name it. Plus we try to get there at least once ��a week.Saturday - Spinach Egg Drop soup! Yummy!Chris, Jose and Gwen along with all the staff are wonderful. They make you feel like you are going home for a meal.Portions? HUGE! ��Plan on taking home a whole extra meal from your leftovers.I really haven't had their pizza. But try the Chicken Parm or the Breaded Pork Chops.Love La Villa!"
"Excellent food--try their house special rolls, especially the crab one. We sat at the sushi bar which was interesting, however our waitress wasn't particularly engaging. Great food, great atmosphere, service could use improvement."
pretty good burgers are great. sorta pricey
"Came with a group of 4 on Saturday night, the last night of Restaurant Week. ��It was my first time trying Ethiopian food and it did NOT disappoint.With a friend I shared an appetizer of spicy lentils, a meal of meat messob and a dessert of sambussa turnovers in raspberry sauce. ��The meal was INCREDIBLE. ��Combined with the great prices, this was a five star experience.The lentil dish was amazing; spicy with strips of pepper and perfectly delicious when scooped up with the spongy bread that is offered with every meal. ��The best part about being able to eat with one's hands is that it completely removes any taste of silverware that, though subtle, might interfere with such delicate and layered flavors. ��As an appetizer for two, it could have easily fed three or four. ��The lentils were incredi"
"The food was very good and our waiter was helpful. ��However, while we were enjoying our after-dinner drinks, we were asked to leave by the manager so they could have the table. ��Maybe we were lingering a bit, but there were all of 5 people waiting at the bar and no one was coming into the restaurant. ��A very nice evening was ruined by this pushy jackass. ��When this was pointed out to him on our way out, he blew us off. ��There are plenty of excellent italian restaurants in Chicago, so putting up with that kind of treatment is unnecessary. ��Needless to say, we won't be back."
"I've never been to Naples, but this has got to be it. I've made pizza at home with fresh mozz before, and it's a tough gig, it's wet stuff, and these guys tought me to live with the wetness of the cheese. Yes, it puddles in the middle, but when I was a kid we used to soak cake in milk, and dip our bread in gravy. Same gig here. Service is never here nor there, always fine."
"While I have had more interesting and better pizzas, I have to say that this place is a nice experience. I came with my husband and his parents, and they were very comfortable here. There is something for everyone, and since his parents aren't foodies, this was the right place. The service is very nice. Will go back."
"I have to say, I think Gino's East does live up to the hype. ��Despite the fact that it is clearly excessively indulgent, the pizza is just really good. ��What is not to like? ��The crust is super buttery and the pizza is loaded with cheese. ��In addition to the pizza we had a caesar salad which I thought was just fair, but when I return I won't be going back for the salad, I will be going for that deep dish pizza-maybe in about 4-5 months."
"This is a cool place. ��Love the lighting and the glass plate wall where you can see the huge stainless steel barrels where they brew the beer. ��We ordered the Bacon Pop corn which was yummy and the huge Beet salad, also very good. ��The sweet potatoes cakes were my favorite. ��Very clever Russian names on everything but I can't remember any. ��Give them a try. ��They are open late too!"
"Great Coasta rican cuisine. But, it's cash only!!!...come on, this is America. Grow. Up. Please."
"Where should ��I begin?....The food, The service or the Waitstaff?? (all equally bad if I may add). Sunday was my first and last time there. ��I made the mistake of taking my father there to celebrate Father's Day. When we arrived it took about 10 minutes to get cold stale chips and unflavored salsa. Then our waitress did not even introduce herself to us, she just simply came up to us and said ""You ready ��order""? I am familiar with Mexican food, but I always ask how things are prepared, so when I asked her she looked at me like I was speaking another language. Granted her english was not great, but she really looked like she was confused, she was a bit on the old side so maybe she did not hear me so well either. So I just said forget it, just give me the steak burrito with no beans, to play "
"What can I say? ��I've been eating here since I was a young buck. ��I absolutely love this place! I recently moved to Indianapolis and I have to say that one of the things I miss about Chicago is Nuevo Leon. �� The salsa de molcajete is really good to start out with. ��There's one plate that I usually get that's not on the menu called Machitos. ��Machitos, consist of a carne asada, a chesse enchilada, a round grilled onion, french fries, refried beans and, a jalapeno pepper. ��I don't think the food has ever changed the refried beans still taste the same way they did when I was young. ��This place is reasonable cheap compared to other places in Chicago. ��The portions are large enough that at times me and my girlfriend share plates. ��The Enchiladas de Mole are also very good and very cheap. ��I kno"
"Food was very well prepared, service was mediocre. ��The menu is daunting at more than 300 items, so if you don't know your way around, less likely to enjoy the experience. Took two newcomers to Indian food and so we tried several dishes. ��All were very good. Chicken tikka masala, lamb pasanda, lamb vindaloo, tandoori mixed grill (a little pricy, but good). Waiter was knowledgeable and attentive, but didn't seem interested in explaining anything or helping new guests enjoy the experience, seemed to have an attitude, spoke softly, and never smiled once. Extensive wine list with options for all tastes. Overall would recommend based on good food, and likely to return, though not before trying other places that might have better servers."
"When in town you must try a Pequod's pizza. Carmelized crust slightly burnt. Just incredible. Good service. Lunch special that is a super great deal, sm. personal and a beer. Can't beat it!"
"Eesh, even those that take the money at the front door of a historical poetry and music place can be broken and bitter. I arrived at the door on Poetry Slam ngiht with my writer professor friend from Cleveland, editor of a national magazine. Myself, a professor too and software entrepreneur, two Masters, musician, newspaper editor, author and poet -- listed in Poets&Writers Directory. So we're not slouches, and upstanding.Yet upon walking off the street out of the light into the Green Mill entrance area, we were met by a bullying bald bouncer in biker wear. When he wouldn't stop loudly accosting my unassuming friend for being too loud -- I think we said finally here to each other when we walked in -- I politely stated that he was the loud one, not us. Then he kept pressing, pushing obnoxio"
"I went to Nana for my best friend's graduation brunch, and it was a fantastic experience. The service was great. The attention to detail was fantastic. We enjoyed the bilingual abilities of the waitress. The owner was extremely pleasant and made the experience a very family oriented one. We truly enjoyed the beautiful ambience, combined with great tasting food. I wish I had a place like this where I live, and I have certainlyed recommended to other friends who are from the Chicago-land area."
"This place was amazing! My partner and I came here for our first time ever, and the waitress totally gave us the run down on everything. My gf tried the steak which was done to perfection, better then any steak I've tasted so far. I tried the BBQ platter which had ribs sooo tender they fell off the bone. Drinks were just as great, very reasonable and although we spent a nice penny it was worth every cent. The atmosphere was very low key, very private and the booths are great one on one time. Parking was not bad at all, then again we went during the week. Defintely will be coming back here very soon!!"
incredible experience
5 stars if i didn't have to wait an hour for a hot dog!! wow this place is a full house every time i come! cool place if your looking for good fast food!! hope they open a second location
"This is always a fun place to come. ��And, if you park on School Street, there's no meter, so, BONUS! ��But, the food is only so-so, and the service makes the food look good. ��And, it's not like the prices suck, but, I don't know, I always just want this place to be better."
Delicious Food... however I have been annoyed the past few visits by different things. 1. The waiter threw away over half of my Curry Chicken (Which is so good!) without asking if I wanted it to go. 2. My last visit they were 25 minutes of the quoted 45 minute wait. 3. the wait staff just about ran me over on my walk to the bathroom. Yield to the guest... 4. Also on my last visit after waiting the above mentioned time was informed that they were out of Curry Chicken. The whole point of visiting. I do still love the food and atmosphere. I would recommend this place but keep the above in mind.
"Five stars all the way! Everything is well executed, from the simple food to the clever cocktails. Service also shines, and prices are very reasonable for the high quality ingredients. Overall, a great dining experience.This is the food I want to eat. Perfect roast chicken, bone marrow, purist pasta, delicious vegetables (e.g., blackened cauliflower, kale with white beans).Hurry over to River North! Gilt is a revelation."
"I've been a regular here since it opened. ��This is a perfect place for any meal. Although the specialty is the fish for dinner, I have come to be more a Glenn's fan for the breakfast. ��Fantastic and underappreciated brunch spot. There is everything from specialty dishes to never ending bowls of cereal and huge breakfast sandwiches."
"Best Korean I've had in Chicago, perhaps anywhere.Authentic cuisine and ambience, incredibly generous portions, and reasonable prices.Wait staff are ethnic Korean, so do not expect a lot of chit chat. ��Decide what you want, order, and stand back or get singed by the hot coals dumped in the hole at the center of your table.They're open 5 a.m. to midnight (no kidding!)Eatent there three times in last month, and am having our Climb For A Cause VIP Party there on 2/27/10.Only downside: if you plan on being with a loved one afterwards, keep the windows wide open or plan on an evening on the couch."
"Love to watch Chef on TV and also enjoy authentic Mexico cuisine, however our experience was not good. We walked in on a Friday night about 9:30 and promptly got sat. The server took 5 min to greet us and get our drink order which does happen on occasion but not at a 4 star restaurant . Usually when a server does miss a table they make up for it after they realized their mistake, the service never improved. We ordered 6 dishes and 4 of them came to the table cold, they probably would have been great if they were hot. We would have sent them back but there wasn't follow through service with our waiter. The hostess was texting on her cell phone all night not even saying good night to the guests as they left. The young lady would even look up at them but no gesture. I figured I had caught the"
Great lunch specials. You can get a small one topping deep dish plus soup or salad and a drink for $6. The side salad is a big portion. The pizza had four slices. Altogether it was a satisfying lunch for a small price. Wish there was a more convenient area.
Awesome!!! Baby buddha bowls are a great buy and delicious!
"Really enjoyed the ambiance at Zed. ��I was there with a party of 8 for a girlfriends birthday. ��We enjoyed cocktails, wine and a great selection of appetizers. ��The portions were perfect for sharing. ��We had the samosas, calamari, duck flat bread (which was amazing) and a delicious cheese plate. ��Our server however was a bit goofy and did not explain the cheese plate presentation. ��Other than that, I really enjoyed Zed451 and would go back for a relaxing evening of wine and flavorful food."
"I had the french toast combo - yum yum yum! French toast, two eggs, sausage, and bacon for $8...so good. And 10% off for living in the building next door!"
"I took a date to Grand Lux and she was very impressed, the place is nice but not uppthight so you can feel relaxed, the food was very good...and the ��desserts are great"
I love Geja's... the food is always great. ��Friendly Staff a big plus! Just be prepared to smell like fondue on the way out. ��One of my favorite all time Chicago places... highly recommend!
"I would say I came away feeling about the same as Christine B. conveyed in her review. The bar was set pretty high considering the pricing and reputation but ultimately everything seemed just pretty good with a couple of bad parts.  The intention for me and my date was to each get the tasting menu. Our server made it seem like if we didn't upgrade to the ""experience"" menu then we were missing out and would be disappointed.... kind of made me feel like I was buying a car. We agreed to add on the octopus to the tasting menu. For the rest of the meal she was nice and attentive though. I won't go over each dish but I will say that the amuse bouches were the better parts of the whole thing. The caviar amuse with garden sorrel and panna cotta was very tasty. I also enjoyed the caesar deconstruct"
There is a reason that this place has won the James Beard Foundation Award. ��The food and service is superb. ��We ate outdoors on a beautiful June day and found it much to our liking. ��The food is well prepared and you leave wanting to go back again. ��It is owned by famed chef Rick Bayless who is the brother of Skip Bayless of ESPN and sports journalism fame. Great food and great atmosphere. ��Not only was the food good but so was the people watching. I will make sure to go back again the next time I visit Chicago.
"For over two years my husband and I went to Yolk in the S. Loop almost every weekend, sometimes twice a weekend. ��Often we waited the 45 minutes-an hour as we always enjoyed our food. ��I recently called to make a reservation for my husbands 30th birthday and even offered to pay a deposit as they apaprently changed their reservation policy and do not take them anymore. ��The hostess told me that my best bet was to carry out. ��I think that everyone would agree that eggs are not the most practical of ""take out"" foods. ��I wanted to give the owner feedback as someone who has patronized his restaurant regularily since it opened that this response left a sour taste in my mouth. ��Instead of saying ""thank you"" he responded by saying that they serve 1200 people per weekend and that they don't need th"
This is BY FAR may fav italian rest in the city. ��Their food is non-traditional Italian and I really enjoy their specials. ��The outdoor patio during the summer months is pure heaven. ��The only drawback to this place is that their bar is jammed up against their seating area and it is really annoying when people can' t get through to their tables. ��The place is popular so I understand but man it gets croweded in their. ��One time we had a private party upstairs and it worked out really nice.
"Maybe a bit past it's prime of a few years ago, but still an excellent choice in the Windy City. ��Food presentation is a stand-out."
"Just what the neighborhood needed - a high-quality, innovative and fresh take-out place! ?The steak and salmon sandwiches are great - very flavorful, on delicious bread. ?I've gone for carryout several times and have never been disappointed.I've also gone to one of their Underground Dinners, 5 courses for around $55. ?AND, it's BYOB. ?You can have a fine dining experience in a cozy, dimly-lit room with great food and service, and not pay the fine dining cost by bringing your own. ?One other really special detail is that Bon Soiree can give you the number for another neighborhood business, Provenance, who will pair wines with the evening's menu, then deliver them to the restaurant so they are waiting for your when you get there!"
"Best Chinese BBQ in the state, but horrible service.Every visit, there is a service issue.I really wish they can improve on the service, and it would be one of our favorite place."
"Seriously...what is all the fuss about? I've routinely had better hot dogs in people's back yards, at BBQs. I went with 2 other people, and we ordered a wide variety of 'dogs so we could try many of them--not one was memorable. The 'dogs themselves are seriously lacking in flavor, and the startlingly neon green relish is totally void of all flavor. The only redeeming factor about the whole meal were the french fries--otherwise, this joint would be getting 1 star from me. Maybe it's just me. I'm an east coast gal, and I had the same reaction to Al's Italian Beef (also lacking in flavor)--which a ton of native Chicagoans implored me to try. In sum, I wouldn't wait in line for 5 minutes for these hot dogs, let alone the 1.5 hours we spent in line waiting for them. Hot Doug's is a Hot Food Fai"
"Oh god, Sunda, you are a hot mess. ��You're like the bitchy girl in high school that just ruins everything. ��You f-ed up my plans for the rest of the evening because you made me wait around for my ""reserved"" ��table and I also waited so long for my food to come out and i spent way too long sitting around your restaurant. I still have ringing in my ears from how obnoxiously loud it was in there. ��I hear from the rest of my friends who were waiting somewhere else that I missed a good time while I was waiting for your shitty sushi to come out. ��Do you know that I spent way past an hour waiting for sushi that I've already had at Whole Foods, painfully perched on your rickety Ikea barstools when I could've been somewhere else?

"Atmosphere/ambiance: ��nice, really niceService: ��attentiveDrinks: ��a bit priceyFood: ��mehhhIf ""Wilde"" intentionally wants to celebrate the generally bland and blah English cuisine of 100 years ago that Oscar himself would have recognized, it succeeds very well. ��However, for anyone who's been to the UK or Ireland since about 1950, the chow is a lot better there. ��My group had the meat loaf, fish & chips, and the grilled salmon over romaine lettuce. ��The first two get a C-, while the salmon earns a B+. ��Portions are BIG. ��As noted by others, drinks are pretty expensive. ��Interesting mix of diners. ��The eye candy gets better after 8 pm. ��All in all, it's an attractive place but again, pretty mediocre vittles."
"This review is based on the take out service and food quaility.This is my first time at SImply It based on a recommendation.The customer service was exceptional friendly and warm.The packaging Excellent! They wrap all the boxes with plastic wrap (saran wrap) preventing any spills. Love it Love it Love it!There was plenty of food. For the price, you get an appetizer, soup, meal, dessert and a drink! Thats hard to come by these days.I ordered the Curry Mussels Lunch Combo. They placed in 5 mussels! I was only expecting 3 at most. I love my seafood! There was a small side of salad, 2 mini veggetable eggrolls and 1 side of rice. The soup was tofu and vegetables (no complains). I didn't even get to my dessert watermelon). I was too filled.I took 1 star off because the curry wasn't as strong. It"
Nice play! We had a wonderful dinner in the terrace with a vegable burrito and a pepito. I recommend this place for a relax warm day in the terrace. The only problem is that you have to pay with cash. But they had a cash dispenser inside so no problem.
Very reasonable food.....everything on the menu is better than okOne of my FAVORITE thin slice pizza's in CHICAGO...
Very old fashion. Came in for an early dinner on monday and by the time we left it was fairly busy. Big portions and good service.
"Great place to eat, good enviroment, the food is devine and i go their like once a week."
"amazing food and great service !We reached there a little after the time our table was booked for, so dint get it right away. ?But the owner welcomed us warmly with a hot cup of tea and a plate of complimentary dumplings..all our food was really great, well flavoured and good quantity. ?It was fabulous. ?and the owner is just the sweetest guy, he understands the meaning of customer delight......highly recommended!"
"This pizza is one of my favorite's in the city. And that says alot considering Chicago is known for pizza. The crust is magnificent...buttery, soft, and crispy at the same time. It comes out piping hot. Add a cold beer with good pizza and you can't go wrong. I like to stop here before catching a show at the Webster Place theater across the street. Great spot if the Cubs are playing too since the games are always on."
"I travel extensively for work, and have had dinner at most of the better restaurants in Chicago. ?Shaw's has been on my to do list for a while, and my business partner and I finalyl made it there this week. ?I could not have been more underwhelmed. ?A restaurant can not hang its hat simply on having a particular product. ?King crab legs are good, but they are good if I go get them at a high end grocery store and cook them myself. ?The price-point on the crab-legs was simply insane...and I have had a lot of $200-$300 per person dinners in my life. ?At the end of the day though, it's their place and they can price how they want.The crab cake that they served me (and charged $30 for) was one of the worst crab cakes I've had. ?It's a $5-10 crab cake at best. ?Lump crabmeat? ?Not a single piece"
Place was extremely overpriced for the quality of food your getting. Had the sushi and it was average at best. Do yourself a favor go down the street and grab it at Sushi Samba instead. It will be cheaper and taste better. Cool decor but that will only get you so far when you leave feeling like you didn't get any value for the high price you paid.
"The food was wonderful! It's pricey but worth it! My husband had the regular dinner and said the meat was as good as it gets...every single type. ��I just did the salad bar since I am a vegetarian, and thoroughly enjoyed that as well. ��There were tons of things for me to it, and each item was fantastic. ��As good as the food is here, the customer service is even better. ��From the hostess to the server to the gauchos to management. ��They should write business textbooks about this place. ��If you are debating where to go eat in Chicago, you have found your answer."
"Awesome patio. We had to wait an extra 40 minutes to be outside. I never saw the space when it was called thyme but the inside looked great.Big antipasti spread welcomes you as you pass through the well lit dining room. We had ��the Porchetta which is a roasted pork belly ( I think). moist and delicious.the dessert was also awesome. It was made with caramelized pineapple and some kind of gelato on top. ��I would definitely recommend this place, unless you are looking for ��chicken vesuvio, veal scaloppini and garlicky deep red marinara sauce. ��Nothing wrong with that stuff, those are staples of every other Italian restaurant in north America. ��this feels more like the places I ate when I went to college in Rome."
"So, you know how awkward it is to go to an old fashioned record store, walking in and looking around and awkwardly thumbing through the first shelf you come to in an effort to fervently divert your eyes from the scornful gazes of a half dozen snotty and ticked off for no reason hipster clerks? ��And then you discover that you're in front of a bunch of metal albums and you don't really listen to metal, you really want to find this old folk album from the 1990's and you don't know where the folk section is, and you get really nervous because those surly hipsters are still casting frown rays onto you and you suddenly feel like the stupidest, lamest person on the planet, and so you either leave without buying anything or grab the first thing that you see and take it home and never open it?This "
"Absolutely love this place- wish I lived in Chicago so I could go there at least once a week! A couple of my friends and I met there to catch up over lunch. ��They had the quiche (and loved it), and I had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, which was very good. ��Was not thrilled with their potato chips, however (too thick, no salt, no flavor). ��The BEST chai tea latte I've ever had! The atmosphere was great- lots of light comes into the restaurant making it a very pleasant space. ��It was fairly busy, but not too noisy- we were there chatting for over 2 hours and no one bothered us! Decent prices as well- you get what you pay for! Overall, great experience, can't wait to go back!"
Every time I'm in Chicago I have to have a Giordano's deep dish pizza. ��It's hard to say who's pizza is better between Gino's east and Giordano's so I won't take sides and say BOTH! ��If the line is to long at Gino's then I'll take a short walk over to Giordano's.
"This place is top noch. ?I made reservation at the last minute, and they were more than accommodating. Paul Ritchie, I think he was manager, was awesome. He was attentive to every table, and the place was packed. The wait staff with the team concept of waiting on tables , was a mirror reflection of good management. ?Even the guys who brought out the cuts of meat, often ask if they could do the extra  whatever to make dining there enjoyable. ?Oh I almost forgot, for the price with all the sides and salad included, you can't go wrong. ?Great food"
All I have to say is that I don't even eat seafood let alone sushi and this restaurant changed my mind. ��Their sushi is amazing and the atmosphere is great as well. ��The only downside is if you don't have reservations on the weekend it can get really busy. ��You may even have to get on the waiting list for a glass just to drink the beverages that you brought along with you.
"Just had a really annoying experience here. And this is based solely on customer service, since I didn't get a chance to try their food. Since I've seen this place packed with a line out the door many times before, I expected service that was used to the Friday night dinner rush, but they just seemed unprepared and chaotic.I came with one other person to meet someone who was already there (I decided to go last minute). Went to go find her ourselves. since the host said they don't seat incomplete parties, but yes, she was sitting in the back waiting at a 2-top (which makes sense since they were originally a party of 2).They said that they couldn't add another chair, so we asked to wait for a table to open up that we could fit at. But they said no, they can't do that (which is kind of weird,"
this is a really chill down-tempo coffee place. Its got a sweet mini fire place and amazing decor. The coffee/menu list won't blow your mind away but its damn quality. I had a Cider drink with a cinnamon stick along with a chocolate bread - Tis was awesome.. I will definitely be going back there as soon as i can get my lazy ass out of Logan square...P.S. its also got great soup and you must try the cider... its wicked...
"My hubby decided to surprise me for our anniversary by taking to frontera grill. I used to watch his cooking show and thought he cooked great Mexican food. I decided to order a fish plate and it was terrible. It was so bland, I could've had a better meal at Mcdonalds at one third the price. My hubby was not impressed either after recieving the wrong order and also not great flavor in his dish. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone because of terrible service, terrible food and experience.Very disappointed, save your money and have your Mexican food made by a real Mexican! I give one star for having a nice place."
"Tru was the best combination of excellent food and incredible service. ��We went there to celebrate a birthday, and the staff made it a memorable and special event. ��In addition to the extreme attention to detail, the staff was welcoming and friendly. ��While expensive, I would definitely recommend Tru because I felt the food and service were superior to other fine dining establishments. ��I enjoyed the experience much more than Everest, and maybe even Alinea."
"Decent Vietnamese fare at a reasonable price.The Pho with meat balls was pretty good, just a tad bit on the greasy side.The Vietnamese pancake was just so so , Ive had much better.The bubble teas were absolutely amazing and I would go back for that reason. The place was packed but Im not sure what all the hype was about."
How can you serve a Moscow Mule with Texas vodka(Titos)....What kind of a mixologist bar can't get an authentic Russian Vodka in a Russian Themed drink...
"The way everyone's raving about this place, makes me wonder if the owners paid you to flood Yelp with over-the-top, positive reviews. As far as real pizza, I know you happy midwesterners are deprived, as the best pizza can be found in NYC, NJ and other places on the east coast. I got one of the basic pizzas at Fogo. The crust was a little spongy and soggy and not crispy enough for my taste. There is no excuse for this especially if you're using a brick oven. I will say that ingredients were fresh and tasty. The only thing that makes this pizza ""Brazilian"" is the variety of toppings. And thank God the pizza comes in the traditional triangle cut instead of those ridiculous squares. The service was chaotic: one guy making all the pizzas and a cashier/helper who didn't seem to have a clue. The"
Funny that people would give this place good reviews. ��What did you eat that I missed? ��Or did you like their pioneering interior design? ��Or maybe it was the poorly trained staff.I came here with high hopes and would never return!
"I am chinese exchange student go to depaul. :)This is first vietnamese restaurant I like in city. Very good place.The other day I go with friends to this restaurant. We all have good times, my favorite food I order is pho soup. So fresh foods, I steal my friends food because it so good. kekekeke. All people serve us very nice, and owner give me free lemonade.I want to come back, we come back again next week. ��:)"
"I'm a Puerto Rican from New York. Born in Puerto Rico. Aside from Puerto Rican food which is similar, ��I've had good and bad Cuban food and I most say that 90 Miles Cuban Cafe has some of the best Cuban food I've ever had. I had a Cuban sandwich with fried Yuca. My girlfriend also had the Cuban with tostones. I don't add many bookmarks but this one is a must for future visits to Chicago!!! If your expecting a full blown restaurant with a waiter/waitress this isn't it. But if your are looking for outstanding Cuban food and can get over what you may normally expect, then this is it! Unlike other reviews, my service was good. As I sat outside and enjoyed the weather and my food, the locals were non-stop stopping for carry out. A clear indication on how good the food is. The other important fa"
"I think that this is by far the best breakfast place in the city. ��I have gone both on the weekend and during the week. ��Just beware that if you do go on a Saturday or Sunday, your food does take a while for you to get it. ��Though, to add to that, when its busy, how can you expect your food to come out right away?I think the strawberry orange juice is fantastic! ��I have a juicer and this juice is definitely freshly squeezed! ��I think that their pancakes are great and that their scrambled eggs (ask for cheese!) are also fantastic!I highly suggest this place because it has great food and a fun vibe to it!"
"Wishbone is fantastic!I have been going there for years and have never been disappointed. Their foods range from classic breakfast (pancakes, eggs, etc) to southern (grits and cornbread)! It is so delicious. It is one of the few breakfast places in town with good pricing. Sometimes it can get crowded, because its just that good! Service is great. The place has interesting decoration and is great for families. Go to Wishbone!"
This pizza is too good. I've had my fair share of pizza and this really surprised me. I thought that one slice would have been enough to fill me up but that was not the case. I would have given five stars but just wish the slices were a bit bigger.
"Not-your-average...A first for Chicago, this is the only place I've found that does pizza as they do in Brazil (no, it's not all churrascarias).Really excellent pizza (I didn't try the chicken), cooked in a 650-degree oven. ��You can see the flames from the Brown line stairs!Top notch, fresh ingredients (great sauce, delicious italian sausage, tasty mushrooms), and--the key--a nice light crust that has both a good crisp on the outside while preserving some doughiness on the inside. ��If you dig on that style, you'll get a great rendition here, absolutely loaded with both traditional and unusual toppings. ��Try the ""Portuguesa,"" a standard in Brazil but relatively unknown here. Still working out the operational side (they just opened, I'll cut them some slack), but very friendly and informativ"
"Mediocre food, reasonably priced. ��The description beside the 2 star option in Yelp says it all -- Meh, I've experienced better. ��The menu is great, authentic Italian, with simple ingredients that should work. ��Too bad the execution is Meh. ��I am reviewing the dishes of both myself and my dining companion.APPETIZERS:Panzanella -- really? Refrigerate the salad in advance? ��I guess that works as long as one of the star ingredients of the dish isn't an ingredient that loses all of its flavor once refrigerated. ��Oh wait... it is. ��Made all the worse by the fact that the tomatoes in the panzanella looked like they were probably great before they were refrigerated.Carpaccio - horrible. ��The worst I've had. ��I had to send it back. ��The first clue should have been the white mayonnaise-like sauce g"
"Great Chicago fondue staple. Have been eating at Geja's for years, and always return. Not for the quick dining experience though, as fondue takes a while to cook, then eat. Romantic environment, with ample food and drink selections. The chocolate fondue is to die for!!! If you like fondue and have some time, try Geja's!!!"
Lemon sea scallops and new england clam chowder....MMMMMMM
"This place is awful. By far the worst place I visited in Chicago. Our dessert took forever to arrive, tasted terrible, and cost a lot of money. Our waitress was overwhelmed and left the table for ages at a time and the exterior of the restaurant was overrun by homeless beggars. I wouldn't go back to this place if they were giving out cash. Just a terrible terrible terrible experience."
"Overall I was impressed with Sunda. It has a great atmosphere, location, and I thought the food was awesome. A bit pricey, but I think it's pretty fair for what you get. A good place for groups or special occasions. The loompya, crap cake crusted ahi tuna, the dry braised string beans, and the dessert called ""ridiculous"" were all delicious. ��I will come back for sure!"
Went here for my birthday dinner. AMAZING
"If Jesus came down and said take me out to eat, this would be the first place I'd take him. ��The cheese, the sauce, the bread, the crust... Unreal. ��If I could eat something my whole life, it would be Art Of Pizza. ��If food was a girlfriend, I'd ask Art of Pizza to marry me. ��This pizza makes s-x feel mediocre when you compare the feeling you get from your first bite."
"If you looking for somewhere to impress your date, Grand Lux Cafe is the way to do it. It's fancy and high class without the large price tag. Plus, it's right by the movies. The wait time could be pretty lengthy if you don't get there on time, especially on the weekends. I like it"
"I could eat this crust for breakfast, Lunch and dinner, It's that good, Even make a sandwich:) Don't go if your looking for Chicago stuffed or cracker thin, Those are great, But this pizza needs to be in your rotation."
"I was part of a party of 4 for Friday, December 16. ��Two of the people in the group had birthdays that week, so we were there for their birthday dinner. ��We picked up some nice wine and found a parking spot right across the street, only to find out when we got there that they decided to close for the evening. ��No phone call, no one waiting at the door, just a hand-written sign on the front of the door.Now I know that stuff happens. ��And I know that this place is notorious for canceling reservations and being generally tough to get a reservation to begin with. ��However, not even bothering to call to let you know that your reservation has been canceled is inexcusable! ��I mean, the place is small, so how hard would it be to call the dozen or so parties you have booked for that night? ��A phone"
"This place was by far one of the best places that I have eaten at in Chicago. Not only was the food and drinks exceptional, but the staff members make this place the most memorable. My party and I felt like royalty the whole night and the service was on top of their game! The whole experience was well worth the price of the food. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great food, drinks and dining experience."
"We came here on a Friday night with a group of 12 to celebrate an engagement.Pros:- The food is astonishingly good. Do yourself a favor and try the Empanada and the Churrasco.- The ambiance is fun without being too loud for casual conversation, though it would have been nice to get a better table location.Cons:- Even with a reservation and with the restaurant not being full, we had to wait in the bar for 15 minutes to be seated. Not a fan of this.- I was surprised at how long it took for our first round of drinks to come out. Same for the appetizers that were ordered next.The drinks here get a lot of hype, but my sangria was pretty average. I would definitely come back to Carnivale again, but it is not high on my list."
"This place is def. overrated! The food isn't bad but not that great neither. Hence, 3/5.I like that the location is convenient. The service is okay too."
"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Great Vietnamese food, amazing prices, super fresh, and the owners are so generous with giving you a little extra something with your order. I am Taiwanese so I love Asian food, and don't get me wrong, I go up to Argyle too--but the food here is just consistently better quality, fresher, and CLOSER to where I live. Plus, they deliver! What more can you ask for? My favorite dishes are the pho, the shrimp salad, and the pumpkin and shrimp soup. All so yummy. Try to avocado wontons too! We got them for the first time tonight and they are delicious! Yay for Simply It!"
"NEEDS WORK!!! Over crowded (can't move), not honoring reservations (mine was 40 minutes late), food was an Asian version of Rockit's menu (glorified bar food). The kitchen could not even get our dinners correct (we ordered 4 entrees and they all arrived at our table 5-10 minutes after the last)... Seriously over-hyped!!!! I wish you luck if you choose to go to Sunda. Japonais anyone???"
"Personally, I had a wonderful dining experience at this restaurant. The ambiance was perfect for an evening out and the service was great. The food was generous sized and family styled, which I really like, and it's great to be able to order a variety of dishes so that everyone could try it. They have one of the best lamb dishes with tomatoe sauce and spinach rice I have ever had (I forget the name of the dish), and I was thoroughly impressed with their dolma and cold plate dip dish. I will definitely go back to this place again and recommend anyone who wants great service, good sized portion for the money spent, and awesome Greek food, should eat at this restaurant at least once."
"5 of us went to Simply It on Thursday night about 7:30pm. The restaurant was basically empty. Price - 5 entries and 3 appetizers with tip about $20.00 per person. Ambiance - The restaurant is small so the tables are close together, but I would have a nice dinner date here, or meet a group of friends. The ambiance allows for both. Service- The waiters could not have been nicer or more attentive. Yes, there were only 4 tables total to cater too, but still the service was great. Food- Appetizers - shrimp tempura, A chicken puffed pastry, and spring rolls. shrimp tempura and spring rolls were fine, but the puffed pastry came with two great sauces, and it was a large portion and very tasty. ��Entrees - Spicy shrimp and the coconut mango beef. The coconut mango beef was pretty good, but the spicy"
"I've never heard of caramelized crust until trying Peqoud's. Woww, if they sold the crust alone, I'd pay. I'm not usually a big fan of deep dish pizzas. It's been a few months since I've dined here, but I remember that the service was good and quick, my cup of joe never went empty. I'll have to make another round here soon."
"Best beer selection that I've found in the city. ��I loved it. ��They try to serve as much as possible in the actual glass for the microbrew.The bartender put a little too much head on all of the beers, so I felt like I was always being gypped, but all good beer should be aerated, so I guess I can't complain. ��When paying $8 for 12oz of beer, I don't want 3 oz of foam.Getting a table large enough for our group of 10 was painful, but at least we didn't mind the extra drinking time. ��The food was pricey and I thought that they had a poor selection. ��I didn't even like it when they brought it out. ��My wife loved her CB&J (cashew butter and jam). ��She still raves about it to this day, so that's why I still give this place 5 stars.I will definitely go back there, but will definitely go with a sma"
"We love The Gage! The venue is beautiful, the food is fabulous, the service is great, serious wine list....it's all there! We have eaten there many times and have never been the least bit disappointed. Dinner, lunch, ever. I'd list which dishes I love, but it would take too long. Try the nightly specials....always interesting. Do try the fois gras appetizer in a jar; it is luscious. The steak salad is amazing. Elk steak. Fennel soup. I could go on and on. Love The Gage."
"I've been coming here for Years and the food has always been great and the service has been super consistent. Although prices can be high, the chenjeh and lamb is a great combination of meet. You get one skewer of each and it will be sure to fill you up. A side of hummus as an appetizer works nice and a bumya with tea as a dessert always hits the spot"
The Best Coffee !
"Delicious food, interesting menu, great service. ��A little loud but fun atmosphere."
"OMG! OMG! OMG! I can't believe I waited so long to eat at Big Jones. This little A-Ville Southern spot is a diamond in the rough. With so many mediocre eateries in the hood, it was a true delight to learn that this place is a cut above the rest. My Fiancee and I decided to finally eat here over the weekend and entered to a packed house and were cheerfully greeted by the hostess. Although we did not have a reservation, she managed to get us seated in about 5 minutes at the peak time. Our Server, Danny was amazing to say the least!! We informed him that we had not been there before and wanted some recommendations. His explanations, descriptions and suggestions on both the cocktail and dinner menu were extremely helpful, and we decided to go with his favorite choices. He first brought us over"
"Lives up to the hype. Amazingly fresh Mexican. Entrees sizzle and melt in your mouth. Quality in Mexican food combined with innovative twists make this a must. ��Drinks are perfection as well. ��Best bet: sit at the bar. Your in the middle of it all, and hardly a wait there."
"Ok I would say that I am really disappointed about Frontera, the reason is because I wanted to eat so bad in this restaurant since the longest, unfortunately my visit two weeks ago was a waste of time and money, the guacamole is good, however the mole enchiladas and the taquitos de pollo tasted really really bad my friend and I couldn;t eat our food since the chicken tasted HORRIBLE and it was kind of black ..at the end we wasted almost $80 dollars.. so sad.. =/"
had the best steak I have ever tasted the other night. It was cooked properly and all the food was top notch. The service was great and not pushy. Great wine list. everyone treated us really well. Been to other steak houses but this was the best. Will keep going
I like this bar. It's a cool place to grab a drink. They have good wings too!
I brought my girlfriend here for dinner for Valentine's Day and couldn't have been happier. Our waiter was awesome and knew about everything on the menu which is always helpful when trying to decide what dish to order. The staff was very quick at re-filling our water and cleaning our table. Food was excellent and I really loved the atmosphere.I enjoy eatintng out and love to bake so the only thing I wish they would improve on is the dessert. I got the chocolate molten cake and it wasn't ��very warm or chocolatey. I thought it needed to have more of an intense flavor like Valhrona chocolate. My girlfriend got a special that had that looked like a bowl of chocolate soup. �� I would go back minus the dessert.
"love that place! very friendly, clean, food is delicious!!! u can choose between spicy and not spicy, so u can easily bring friends who are not used to the spicy food and they'll enjoy it too.. i truly love that place!! the best Ethiopian restaurant in Chicago!!!"
"I had a really amazing experience at GE. The food was incredible and beautiful. We did the full tasting menu. Do no go expecting free popcorn or a la cart. Have an open mind. This place is doing something different than before, so try not to go in with certain expectations (if you've been before), and I think you will be happy."
"I have to agree with some previous posters here that they pack the place way too full. ��This is the type of bar that I want to enjoy by relaxing and having some great beer, very hard to do when I cannot move and there is a weird person jammed right in next to me. ��The bartenders have never been super friendly to me, maybe they are too busy? ��The beer selection is obviously fantastic and all of the apps that I have had have been good to.I will make it a point to come here on a less busy day and rereview ...."
"I just came here last night and it was just fabulous!our party was a bit unorganized and nobody called to notify them that we were running late by half an hour. our gigantic party of 14 people ended up waiting another 25 minutes because our table was seated to other reservations. the staff cleared out the dining room for our party, while then we ate lots of small little mini eggrolls, talked and had a great time waiting. before I knew it, we were in and seated!Onto the food, I ordered the pineapple callamari and this thing was just fabulous. Just perfectly cooked, not too overseasoned I ended up ordering another one to go for lunch in the afternoon tomorrow! BYOB that's a HUGEEEE PLUS!Our birthday girl was sang happy birthday to, they turned off all the lights in the dining room and the wh"
"OH MY EFFING GOD!why have i not been here before? i always walked by, for the past year and a half since I moved into lp but never tried it.a few days ago i finally had time to walk in, grabbed some lunch and tried their special sandwich. I had the beef one it was sooo good! with all the sides it came with and a smoothie it was the perfect lunch ever!it was cold the other night too and i wasn't in the mood to walk down the street to pick it up. So I ordered delivery, got their beef noodle soup and it was just the perfect pick-me-up! this place is soo good, i ordered and they said it would be 45 minutes before it would come, it only took me 20 mintues to get my order, GREAT! good, fantastic and overall awesome place!-John"
"I saw this restaurant reviewed on the show Check Please! (which i watch religiously) and decided to go with my sister the next day. I also made sure that we went to the right location.My sister and I weren't really interested in any of the sweet/dessert crepes because most of the things they put in them you can just buy yourself, so went straight for the savory crepes. There were no more than 10 different kinds of crepes listed and they all seemed to have the same things in them except for one extra topping whatever it may be. To be honest, i couldn't really tell the difference between all of them, so i got the Chicago Crepe (the extra topping was avocado) and my sister got the Icosium Crepe (which had generally the same things in it as mine). I ordered a bit of smoked salmon on the side i"
"Great food, great staff, and an awesome place in the Wcker Park neighborhood to watch sports anytime!"
"The food was okay,seemed more like a Mexican restaurant with a few Costa Rican dishes. The workers dont have any uniforms or at least a shirt that says the name of the place, you can easily mistake the worker for a customer."
Has to be my favorite place in the city to eat. Food is amazing and the staff is great. I have had them make me stuff that wasn't on the menu since I didn't know what I wanted. 10 stars in my book.
"Service was Awesome! ��Synchronized water refills! 4-5 waiters for just our table! ��The dessert and the Madeleine Cookies to go were the best. The prixe-fix ��food itself was visually incredible, but so-so on the palette. ��She was impressed, however, ��I wouldn't go again unless they improved the menu."
"Stopped in Shaw's twice this month. Ffirst time we went after work and sat at the Oyster Bar. Service was great, the bartender outstanding. We tried a sushi combo plate (ok) and the crab leg bites (very good, but could have used a butter dipping sauce instead of horseradish).The second time I went in alone late on a Saturday. The waiter seemed in a hurry for me to order, eat and go. He was attentive, but overly so. I tried a combo bar app plate. Crab cake was good, but tiny. The shrimp was ok, too. Bread served with the meal could have been hotter."
"I'm done with this place! It happened again yesterday. Twice before we've been overcharged and I've caught the errors. But, yesterday, it happened again! So I'm now convinced it is a common practice at this place. We went there for breakfast, (eggs, etc.) and the bill came to over $40 for 3 people (average price was $9. per person.) When I checked ��the bill, ��they'd added ��$10.00 more to the bill. When I confronted the waitress, she got very nervous and didn't know what to say! If you must go, ��beware and CHECK your bill, twice!"
i stop by yesterday and tried their la la chicken and orange tenderloin beef; it very very tasty. the beef was deep fried then sauced and the la la chicken is superb. the hot pot here is very good too.
Honestly I heard so much hype about this place and it was the biggest disappointment... It is ok pizza and that's being generous but it can't even compare with due's pizza which is the best deep dish pizza by far... And uno's which is the same company and recipe as due's... I know alot of you won't agree but art of pizza just doesen't compare to the original and best deepdish of Chicago...
Very good soup for a decent price. I am here at least once a week.
"food was delicious, from the appetizers (brussels sprout salad) to the entrees (chilean sea bass, adobo pork belly) to the dessert (the Ridiculous). ��the flavors from each of the entrees works very well together, and they were reasonably large portions. ��the Ridiculous dessert was huge (two of us couldn't finish it), but it is definitely worth trying."
"catering from simply it was simply astounding. calling the restaurant a few days in advance the catering was so easy as pie. the man on the phone took my order of what i wanted, the location, place, and time. a few days later i called back the day before just to confirm everything was alright and my whole order was repeated to me as if i just called in only 15 minutes ago. food came on time, and let me tell ya, it's just delicious.we had only a small party of 15 peeps all of which were really hungry people i got several half tray orders of an assortment of beef skewers, lemongrass chicken, eggrolls, grilled lemongrass beef and shrimp springrolls. everything tasted so fresh, and most importantly to my appetite none of it tasted frozen. this place is just great, simply it is simply astoundin"
"Nice place because drinks are strong, the music is great, decor and history is awesome. A nice place to watch and listen jazz music. Beer and drink prices are cheap-fair.The best thing about this is, this is where Johnny Depp Hung out."

I absolutely LOVE Gino's. I live in AR and have been to Chicago several times. Every time I go I make sure we get to eat at Gino's. I just realized that you could order the pizza online and have it shipped to anywhere in the U.S. I am soooo excited! Will definitely be doing this. It is THAT good! :)
"Saw that Glenn's Diner was being reviewed and just had to jump in. Lived behind Glenn's for several years...my back porch faced their kitchen door and the dumpsters that are on each side of the kitchen back door.At all times of the days, I would see the cooks and the wait staff come out the back door to smoke. They would haul dirty empty milk crates around to sit between the dumpsters outside the back door and on each side of the back door. During slow times they would go out and toss a football back and forth.Do they properly wash their hands when returning to work? I don't know. But I do know that the area directly inside the back door never looked very clean when I would cut through the employee parking lot. Were they ?smoking 15 feet from the back door...no, they were right outside the"
Came accross the country for this amazing breackfast. WOW
"Pizza was good. Service was really poor. I went in tonight with my wife, sister in law and my 2 yr old. Just flew in from SF. It was raining. I get in and I see the hostess and the first thing she says is ""fold the stroller"". No hi, welcome, come on in. Just "" fold the stroller"". Rude. The hostess here literally walk around trying to look busy. Losers. Pizza ok, service crap. And we had to ask 3 different bus boys to refill our root beer cause our waitress was never around. Poor reflection on our first restaurant in Chi Town."
"If you like cheese and wine, I can't think of a better spot in downtown Chicago. ��Enjoy a flight of each. ��The Persian Feta is not to be missed!"
My friend dragged me to this place for lunch because she said it was incredible and it was...an incredible wait. I stood in line for almost 30 minutes for a hot dog. These people who wait here are nuts. I don't see how this is any better or worse then other hot dog joints. I chalk it up to herd mentality.
"this is a great place! ��the value to me is not as good as texas brazil, but this food is definitely quality. ��the salad bar is great! ��service is professional. ��i have never had to wait more than 15minutes to get a table here. ��even with coupons, my bill for two people always seemed to get near $200. ��if you like meat, this is a great place to definitely goi have been back many timesthey have many coupons you can get if you search online and also i receive them in the mail from time to time"
"I Think they much have just change there dispributer when they changed there menu. There food used to to a bit over priced, but very tasty, now it is overpriced and bad"
"This place is absolute class. I had some cash to drop and wanted to impress my boyfriend so I made reservations for yesterday evening. Sweet tits, it was soooo great! I had a Key Lime Pie martini which was liquid heaven. Also, one must have oysters to begin with... very moreish. ��And though I didn't see it coming, the sushi was damn fine too! That's not really what you're there for though - it's all about the lobster, crab and shrimp. It's mighty tasty and they give you your money's worth. Oh and raspberry pie ala mode for dessert is sumptuous."
"Sorry but this place is over rated. Every one raves, but the food is served cafeteria style. Everything looks ��yellow like some old folks buffet. Taste was bland. I mean, at least give ti some kick, you're supposed to be middle eastern food. And it is not dirt cheap like you might expect from the decor and presentation. ��Slop me some rice and chicken. Again, i am sorry. I had high hopes. I try it again but the myth is over."
Yum
"The atmosphere seemed fine, I think my main issue was with the waiter. We had just sat down and he took our drink orders and immediately wanted to take our food order we asked for a few minutes 30 seconds later he was back. My order came out first I asked for mustard apparently there was none to be found in the whole resteraunt so he offered Ketchup, on a chicken sandwich really? then 5 minutes later 2 other sandwiches came out. Then 15 minutes later the 3 pizzas came out 3 of us were done and ready to back to work but we had to wait on the other 3. I believe its normal for everyone to get their food at the same time. We asked to have our bills seperated so he took the total and devided by 6 so I paid part of my coworkers bill. Probably will not go back to this specific Gino's located on M"
"We have been to a number of the restaurants in Greek Town and this is by far our favorite. The space is enormous and the ambiance is great. I came with a Greek friend who ordered all our food and wine, and it was all superb. The waiter was very attentive and helpful."
"This place cant miss, their prices portions and quality of food is excellent .I have been coming to this particular Garcia's for a while now and I am completely satisfied."
I went to this place on a Tuesday night at 8pm. We waited 1 hour and there were empty tables everywhere. It was super annoying and inefficient. The 'small plates' as they call them are super small and are really expensive. I guess you pay for the artsyness and intricate tastes. I got something with liver and white chocolate and watermelon. It was horrid and it cost $20. The entrees are bigger and more reasonably priced. The service was bad our hostess was mean and did not even give an accurate timing of when we would be seated.This place is not worth it. Go somewhere your money will be well spent!On top of it all it's filled with hipsters...
My friendsand I were looking forward to eating here but the night we went they didn't have alot of items on the menu. We asked for the General Manager to complain and ended up being a complete asshole aout it. Would not recommend this place.
best Mexican food in the city...
I just have to say that hands down this is one of my favorite places to eat up north! Service is great!!! I highly reccomend their sushi!
"This is a fantastic restaurant, I wish it was closer so I could go all the time! ��Went on a weeknight and were luckily able to get seats at the bar after waiting only a few minutes.My favorite dish was the scallop/oxtail/truffle gnocchi. ��It seems like a lot of ingredients but it worked perfectly and tasted wonderful. ��So good I wanted another order! ��Also tried the veal heart dish which I would highly recommend. ��The chicken entree was good, but sort of a thanksgiving themed dish, it was not as unique as the others and I will probably try something different for an entree next time I can get back there."
"Wow. ��Well, we had an incredible night tonight. ��Given the weather outside this Sunday (ICE COLD), it took a lot to get us out. But a birthday for a friend deemed it necessary, so we did. ��And I am glad! ��Had dinner across the street at Francesca Fornos and then came here for cocktails. ��It rocked.We went in at about 7 pm, and even though it was freezing outside on a Sunday, the place was filling up...lively atmosphere, but seemed well-controlled by the kind woman at the door and the rest of the staff inside. ��We had no problem getting a seat, and spent a brief spell at the bar with a very cool guy (Kyle I think) who helped us with drinks to start while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. ��The woman who sat us ended up being our server, Laura, and she was exceptional -- we were "
nice place for a good dinner with a special ��someone
"Delish, delish, delish pizza everytime I go... which is often. ��My favorite is the white pizza with ricotta, fresh tomatoes and basil. ��Even my carnivore for a husband loves it! ��Yes, it does get stupid crowded and noisy on the weekends; my advice is to make Piece a mid-week destination. ��What's keeping this place from a 5-star in my book is the weekend noise level and rather unfriendly crew of patrons."
"Maybe I'm out of date, but I love the look of Tru. ��The separate room for cocktails leads to a bit of drama when you are brought into the main room to be seated. ��The room is just pure class, very impressive.Service was outstanding, as we expected. ��The wine list was really interesting here, too.My only complaint was...the food! ��My meal was outstanding, but my three companions had mediocre to disappointing entrees. ��Maybe the mistake was not going with the tasting menu. ��We normally would, but were reluctant because we didn't want to spend 3 hours eating dinner (we had a late seating). ��Everything looked really pretty, but my companions dishes were just kind of blah. ��Not what you want from a restaurant like this.I still give Tru four stars, because the experience was great (and my meal w"
"I LOVE this place! The skirt steak is delicious, the appetizers are great especially the Ropa Vieja. I am never disappointed when i go there. the staff is wonderful too."
"We had a WONDERFUL Valentine's dinner last night with some out of town friends. Dan our waiter was excellent and the entire dining experience was outstanding. This is ��my ""go to"" place in Chicago and it has never disappointed!"
I WILL BE BACK!!!I love closing the place out!!!
"The music is good and the actual location is really beautiful. It is one of the prettiest bars I've been to and the atmosphere was great. But the bartender and waitresses. UGH!! Rude...and slow. I ordered a coke from the waitress and she mumbled something and then I waited for over 15 minutes. So, since there weren't many people, and I was thirsty, I went up to the bar to just get a coke. The bartender said to me, uhhh...you know a coke doesn't have booze. Not jokingly, but like I was an idiot. Why yes, in fact I do know that a coke doesn't have alcohol, that's why I'm ordering it, thank you very much. Then the waitress walks by and says, hey she ordered from me. and gave me the coke on her tray. Granted, he did already have the coke ready to go so I could see his agitation, but I apologiz"
"reasonable prices and great food!my birthday was here last weekend, crowded night and their dining room was filled to the brim. we had to wait a bit but it wasn't too bad. my party was given free little finger foods while we waited in the bar area. we then proceeded to the dining room, all our food came out on time. i had the beef short ribs. delicious! in the end we were given free crispy fried bananas with ice cream on the side and turned off all the lights when my birthday cake was brought in. 5 stars for awesome place, great food and knows how to treat a birthday girl :)"
"Love the outdoor seating except for the fact that my friend and I were sitting right under the music speaker. ��We asked them to turn the music down, and they did so w/ attitude. ��After about 10 min, the music was up to full volume. ��Sort of annoying....On the flip side, the food was great. ��We both got the shrimp platters. ��Food was fresh and very tasty. ��We got the guac for an app. ��It was just OK. ��It did not have that much flavor and the consistency was off, like I'm pretty sure the used mayo. ��Cheap Cheap Trick, Irazu!"
"I was disappointed with my pizza. I think this place is very overrated. Im sure if i got another pizzza with toppings of my choosing i might be a little more satisfied . But then again i liked most of ��the toppings minus the mushrooms. Maybe im just not a deep dish pizza lover. The service was great and the staff was super friendly. Expect the lady who was the parking valet,she was jerk."
"Alinea is outstanding! The food, atmosphere, presentation and service was superior! ��Truely an amazing experience!"
My household orders from these guys once a week..it is sooooooooooooooooooo good...The pizza just has a wonderful taste and they bake it long enough for the cheese on the edge to be crispy and delicious...I have not had any problems..the delivery guys are very nice and for a deep dish pizza unless they are super busy we have it in less than an hour. �� ��Its very resonable as far as cost. ��We always get it delivered but I hear it is a cute litlte place with a unique atmosphere.I recommend them to everyone.
"I think this is the best lamb in the city. ��Really, it was cooked perfectly and it just kept on coming! ��For the money this is one of the better values around, I really think we ate more than $55 per persons worth."
"First of all, I love whiskey. ��So when a place claims to be a whiskey bar i get a bit skeptical. ��Not here though. ��As far as I could tell they had over 80 different whiskeys. ��The other problem with most whiskey bars is that the prices can be pretty high. ��But they have something like 20 whiskeys for $3 a glass.Now, the food. ��There are some basic things on the menu like salads and burgers, but there are also some more interesting items like duck fries, bone marrow. ��The list goes on and on. ��In the end this place is fantastic.Before you leave make sure you end the night with a Manhattan or a cup of coffee. ��Best of both worlds."
"Piccolo Sogno gets a lot of publicity for it's outdoor oasis. ��Also, after reading the reviews, we decided to make an early reservation for 6 pm.The matinee we attended was over by 4:30, so I called to change the reservation to 5:00 and they said it was fine. ��We walked through the bar area, which was kind of busy. ��Then, when approaching the patio, half the tables were filled. ��By 6 pm., we would have been waiting for sure. ��So, early bird gets the worm!The service from our server was the best! ��Pietro was right on the spot.We ordered drinks, wine, appetizers, dinner and dessert. ��I did not findthe food anything to write home about. The bread basket was good but we had to ask for another one because there were 2 breadsticks and 2 rolls and there were four of us. My husband had the salted,"
"Probably one of my favorite sushi places in the city. ��Cozy, excellent selection, always busy and BYOB which makes the overall bill pretty reasonable. ��Coast is second on my list to a place on Southport just north of Belmont... but I can never remember the name!"
"@jaire q. if they serve donkey meat, then it's AMAZING! ��I too simply don't care. ��The environment of this place is awesome. ��The wait staff is on their game. ��I never had an empty glass the whole time I was there. ��The ropa vieja is out of this world! ��The Victoria's Secret is delicious. ��I love love love Carnivale!!! This place is great! ��Make your reservations quick because they do fill up!"
"If you like your hamburgers cooked medium well, it would have been a superb meal. Unfortunately I asked for medium rare and was handed a rock. ��I'll attribute it to opening night jitters.Great mash potatoes and IPA though."
"Indie Cafe Thai & Sushi-OMG, why didn't I try this before???They had a special the night I went-Tamarind Shrimp! The shrimp were HUGE and JUICY. (My mouth's watering as I think of it.) The Spider Maki was excellent! The sushi portions were HUGE and extremely fresh.It was a very busy night, but they seated my party of two fairly quickly.This place gets an A++ from me!"
I love the decor and ambience. I have been a couple times for drinks on the roof. Service is not stellar. I actually just ate there for the first time and was disappointed it was a meat on a stick spin off of a brazillian steak house. Way too much garlic- not a fan.
"My wife and i went for an early dinner on a weds. night. ��The place is a little on the small side and IT WAS PACKED!!!! ��We were both shoulder to shoulder with the people on either side of us. ��Oh well, that's not their fault. ��I had the almonds sauteed in pork fat...not sure how that sounds but it tasted amazing. ��The milk braised pork shoulder was just ok. ��It didnt live up to the hype. ��I really want to go back and try other things on the menu. ��Oh and the wine selection is pretty good. ��I had a Spanish red which worked real well."
"More English than Irish, this gastropub is crackin'. �� The cheese plate was plentiful, tuna was devine, fish-n-chips came in newspaper (sans peas - an admitted slight disappointment), all marked by fabulous company and one of the best wait staff in Chicago (Thank you Steven!). ��Enjoy!"
"My favorite neighborhood spot! ��The food is out of this world and the menu changes weekly, so there's always something new to try. ��Definitely make reservations because its always packed (and there's a reason!)"
"If I could post zero stars, I would. This was my first trip to a Ruth's Chris and undoubtedly my last. When a group of 11 people go to a restaurant for a birthday dinner you would think that restaurant would gladly welcome the money, but this particular establishment apparently does not need it. Our party was refused the purchase of 2 celebratory bottles of champagne even though we had not ordered any other alcohol yet. Then 6 of our 11 entrees were delivered wrong, including no less than 5 hairs from the head of the head chef Jorge Fernandez, who even admitted to it being his preparation and hair. After we complained to Jenny Estes , the manager, her response was ""you need to get away from."" No apology, no compensation. Because we didn't eat we felt we shouldn't pay, but Jorge ��Fernandez "
"I have NEVER seen such a big salad bar in my whole entire eating life :-) Meat eaters dream...but it's not just for meat eaters becaues you will have a million and a half choices of salad toppings and sides to eat. It's a fun family place to eat, a group event or even a date place. Go and Try IT"
"We were amazed at how friendly the entire staff was however the owner, Tuan Nguyen, treated us like we were his own family. He was very warm and friendly. This was our first visit but my sister, who was visiting from out of town, thought we must dine here a lot. Well, we will definitely be going back and ordering delivery. The food was wonderful. We enjoyed everything we ate. For appetizers we had Shrimp Spring Rolls, Grilled Lemongrass Beef, Chicken Puff, and Saigonese Crepe. Another reviewer mentioned the sauce for the Spring Rolls, which I agree is a don't miss, however all of the sauces we tried were great and paired well with each of the appetizers. The entire meal was fresh and tasty from beginning to end. The meal ended with a juicy orange which was perfectly refreshing."
Another good family find! ��If you go for dinner and you're carb conscious or dieting they really have a lot to choose from...it's just hard to stay away from the delicious corn muffins.
"The food is decent, it's a big menu of bar food- who can really complain about that. ��The other night we were hungry, started looking up places that delivered in the neighborhood and Fifty/50 came up! 'Hey that's cool that they deliver' I thought. ��They make a big deal about ordering online and delivery on their website too. ��No business should promote a service that they don't have systems in place for- case and point: We had to call to place the order cause online wasn't working. Talked to bartender, she had a hard time hearing so went in the other room to hear better- smart move- she was very thorough taking the order, guessing because she usually is getting drinks and not food orders, no problem- I'm pretty patient as a customer. ��She says great it will be there within the hour, probab"
"Wonderful Italian in Andersonville. ��Worth getting out of downtown to go here and see one of the neighborhoods that really makes Chicago what it is.Really fresh food great variety of options. ��Not just a pasta mill -- although that's outstanding. ��Otherwise, really fresh, great variety of options of meats and seafood. ��Prices are quite reasonable given the high quality of ingredients, prep and presentation.Beautiful room, great patio out back when the weather cooperates.Has a big following, so reservations are a must if you can get one."
"I love this place, especially the bake to order desserts. However, every time we go we have to wait at least 30 min for a seat, and they do not take reservations - be prompt!"
I arrived at this place and it was pretty full so the host took my name and said it would be a few mins before I would be seated. Then a couple walked up 3 mins later and they were seated immediately.
Yummy Yummy Yummy. I went to Coast for the first time over the weekend and I'm in love. it was a Saturday night and it was busy. We didn't wait long to be seated and after that all my sushi dreams came true. If you like sushi give this place a try. It's in a fun neighborhood and the food is A+
You eat with your eyesbefore you eat with your mouth.Quite simply...scrumptious!
"I have had a pulled pork sandwich and the bomber burger here. Both were very good. If you're looking for a casual, laid back environment to have some solid food and a few beers by Lincoln Park, this is a good spot."
"I thought the breakfast was great! ��I ��had the Red Eggs with asparagus. ��I didn't go in expecting much, since it was just eggs, but the food was fantastic.Service was a little slow, but you have to cut them some slack since they were busy.I also, like mentioned below, that they offer a discount for bringing in your helmet!"
"Catering here is simply awesome! My friends and I had a birthday party serving about 50 people. Where else to turn to but simply it? I called in and ordered the man who took my order couldn't be anymore helpful and funny. He also asked if it was my first time ordering and I replied yes. To that he included an extra half pan of dumplings to which I was grateful. So the food came on time, fresh, hot and ready to serve. The beef was just tender and juicy. So flavorful and when I went to try the chicken fried rice. Just out of this world! I also ordered avocado wontons, shrimp springrolls, lemongrass chicken (full pan), tilipia and a second pan of beef and asparagus. In fact, it was so good I was contemplating hiding some of the food so that my friends couldn't get anymore for themselves. It's"
I have been to Chicago Diner a lot of times. ��I love eating everything there that I have tried. ��I am telling you the deserts and nondairy shakes are a whole lot better than dairy ones. ��They are not sticky and boogery like dairy. ��The non meat items are really great. ��I love those sweet potato fries. They rule. ��Go there and chow down on some good eats. ��The servers are nice and friendly.
Excellent food and service.
Tortas were delicioso. ��I had the pepito and loved it. ��Washed it down with the tastiest lemonade. ��Good job Rick.
"This is probably the best date place around. ��It's extremely romantic with the dim lighting and the live music, and the private booths. ��My boyfriend took me here just for a nice night out- and it was the best dining experience. We had the beef and shrimp fondue which was excellent and it's so much fun to do the fondue ourselves. ��We had a great time and will be going back."
Pretty good. ��Great for a family day
Best deep dish pizza in Chicago. ��Always have slices on-demand.
This place is amazing. ��Always seems to be busy but they are fast and courteous. ��They have an extensive menu and the food is quite good. ��we will be back.
"Probably the best Cantonese in Chicago. ��Especially the soups - the broth is top-notch. �� Hon Kee down the street does a few of the BBQ items better (char sui in particluar) but the dishes here are much better. ��At $28, the five course peking duck (feeds 3-4 people) is practically giving it away.Anyone who thinks this place doesn't have atmosphere need to die. ��This place has atmosphere an interior decorator couldn't buy with a million dollars,"
great food! ��had the calamari very good.
"Very friendly staff. The pho looks great. The lemongrass chicken is yum and so is the coconut mango beef.We got lemonade and strawberry pineapple sweet things for dessert.Fun place, good food and reasonably priced."
"A favorite place to go to for weekend brunch.Favorite dishes: duck confit, steel cut oats, cheese selection, cinnamon roll and bacon. Frankly, I would be happy with the previous foods, but the rest of the food selection is also delicious.Service has always been good."
"Haven't been here in years, good to know they are still around. ��Service was pretty bad, especially if you do not speak Korean, but what can we do?!?! ��Still love all the side dishes and of course the Kalbi and Jop Jae. ��Am looking forward to the next time we head out there again."
Great bar and heard some decent poetry. The poetry slam was fun.
This is theeeeeeee best pizza I've had outside of Naples itself. Not kidding. I've been there several times and I've taken out. Always good. The owner is super nice too and when theres a big wait he will bring out a pizza cut into small slices to both tide you over and force you to wait...who could leave after such a taste bud teaser?? hee heeSo good
"Awesome sushi, awesome setting, awesome vibe!Went here yesterday with my girlfriend for V-Day and we had a great time. The sushi was great (best dragon rolls i've ever had)PLUS: The BYOB thing was great.Check this place out for sure"
"Everybody knows by now that RJ Grunts is Lettuce's first concept.If you haven't been there, expect good american food with burgers, mac & cheese and plenty of other selection for the whole family including the original Lettuce salad bar.Their only problem is the wait at the bar if you are trying to get a table for their week end for brunch..."
We went for our 28th anniversary and was hoping for a special afternoon. We drove 2.5 hours and planned to walk the Magnificent Mile prior to lunch. The salad bar was amazing and was very fresh. The meat was delicious and was endless. I have never seen service like this. They never let your table leave their attention. Then when she brought us desert our plates were hand written around them Happy Anniversary! with strawberry topping. I found that was very sweet of them and shows they are focused on detail. I would not be able to give any higher recommendation for this restaurant. They are truly one of a kind.
"We had lunch here on a recommendation from the concierge at the JW Mariott, and what a great recommendation it was. I had ��the ribeye sandwich which was well prepared and very tender. My wife had the eggs over homemade hash which she enjoyed immensely. We shared a bread/pastry basket with our friends and the banana bread and apple turnover was pretty darn good. Not bad for pub food. The decor was also trendy and fun sort of Iike a clean subway station but in a good way without the piss smell. I would definitely go back when I return to Chicago in 3 years."
"...10/16/08 Thurs.What can I say that would add to the already stellar reviews Brazzaz has already received? ��Nothing... but I can stress the fact that this was the best ��lunch meal I have ever had, also our party being seated right next to the buffet was a plus. The service was fantastic, both of our servers where kind and very professional. ��The food was delicious and plentiful. ��The overall experience was eye opening."
one of my favore places for years. ��In the summer they have a cucumber margarita that is worth the trip by itself. ��Outstanding !!
"Went here with my mom on a Thursday night and loved everything! I was early to dinner so I enjoyed the opportunity of people watching while I waited. There seemed to be a large party as the hostess kept directing people ""left at the exit sign and up the stairs"" everyone else was 28-40 somethings with the occasional sugar daddy and blonde accessory. Once seated the waiter was very attentive and patient as my mother played 20 questions over the menu. We ended up ordering:-Oxtail pot stickers- delicious and savory but not over sized-Loompya- mini egg rolls and bib lettuce with yummy creative sauces- much better than I expected and a very large portion (I'd say around 10 rolls)Specialty sushi rolls-Crunch Pig, Hidden Lobster- so flavorful and interesting. My favorite out of the the two we got-"
"Went for the Sunday buffet, which from my experience is one of the best I've ever been to. ��They don't skip on the quality or preparation on any of the food being served, and the price is what should be expected.The ambiance and is very pleasant, with everyone dressed as business casual or better. ��The decor is classy with heavy use of wood, but nothing is over done. ��The drinks are in line with the food, and the buffet layout flows well, minimizing large crowds at certain spots."
"By far one of the best restaurants in Chinatown.You will see a great variety of people dining here. It serves authentic Sze Chuan cuisine. It disgusts me when people go into this restaurant and order stuff like egg rolls and fried rice. Skip it. If you want that, go to Panda Express. If you don't know what to order, ask for recommendations. Every single time we have dined here, we have had great service and amazing food. Highly recommend the Three Chili Chicken (Chef Specialty), which is somewhat powdery(?), spicy chicken with just the right amount of oil. Pure heaven. Lao Sze Chuan also serves the REAL orange chicken and orange beef which is simply amazing. Nothing like the frozen crap served at places like Panda Express. They use real orange peels and it has just a hint of crispiness.Now"
"This is the way to celebrate your anniversary, Wow! Mastro's was unbelievable from the minute we walked in the door, and meeting the GM, until the minute we left! Fantastic service, great food and a fun time! I highly recommend this restaurant! Our waitress was so nice, ��helpful, fun and, out going. Let's talk about the food. First we started off with the incredible seafood tower, (could have been my dinner). Then, the wedge salad which was ��scrumptious and the French onion soup, out of this world! The main course was steaks that melted in your mouth. The two side dishes that we had were delicious, one gnocchi and the other lobster mash potato's! (who wouldn't love that)Ok, ��let's not forget about dessert. ��The butter cake was amazingly yummy, it came with a side of whip cream which was in"
"Seriously, dont waste your time here....Unless, you like being treated like a 12 year old. 1st, my gf and I waited for an hour outside. We thought with all the hype it would be worth it. 2nd, the drinks are all $12 and they are not good. 3rd, they have a list of rules when you walk in. 4th, its extremely pretentious. ��We waited in a line outside, then waited inside behind a huge curtain, then had to wait behind another huge curtain before being seated. ��SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE."
"Oh my god, all this time ��and I haven't reviewed Hot Doug's! I guess everyone else has said all that's been said, I will just say that, most of the time, when you are going out to eat, you are getting your pocket picked. Not here. He keeps the prices reasonable, and if I weren't such a pig, I'd have a hard time spending ten bucks here, for the best lunch in town.I usually wind up with more than I need, because I always want to try a special dog, and I have to get a Chicago dog too. I do think Doug sometimes screws up some of the balance on a few of the special sausages, particularly, I don't think the flavored mustards work very well, usually. Being from South Louisiana, I tend to take two approaches to mustard: use it straight, or use it to flavor something, such as remoulade. I think whe"
First time - amazing selection. ��I had the pretzel encrusted walleye while my friend had the potato pancake whitefish. ��Both were wonderful. ��The table next to us had the Char - looked great - think I will try that next ��time. Server was friendly and helpful. ��They recommended the brownie pie with banana foster for desert which came with ice cream. ��Delicious!
"First experience here 2/12/12 was a terrific one! My wife and I had about 9 different dishes, as well as a wonderful dessert. The food was fantastic, plated perfectly...but here was the real impressive aspect: Every single person who came to our table (staff) was incredibly knowledgeable about every dish. It's hard to find that kind of training and commitment these days. Our server (Sally) was a jewel! We will absolutely be back, and we recommend this place to everyone! Hats of to the Chef and his line for a job well done! Thank you!"
"For fancy food, this place is awesome. The food is great and the servers are friendly. You may have a big wait due to its popularity but its very similar to Cheesecake factory minus cheesecake. AMAZING BEIGNETS. Like, best restaurant dessert of my life."
"It's overpriced, pretentious, portions size for dinner very small.I left feeling unsatisfied and ripped off. I had high expectations and was really disappointed with the service. Not going here again, there are too many other places in this great city that have tasty meals with a much more comfortable dining experience."
"Wife and I were the 2nd customers when they first opened. �� Since have returned many times. ��Quite daring to be opening an organic restaurant in Bridgeport but this place might fly if highly successful Chinese eclectic Han 202 is any indicator. ��A heck of a lot healthier than another supposedly Healthy restaurant in the neighborhood. ��Mushroom crepes were light and fluffy. ��Wife's fresh tasting veggie omelet was not too big, light and accompanied by the best hash browns we've had in a long time. �� Fresh squeezed OJ and rich coffee. ��We liked that they don't automatically give you a pile of toast. ��Can't wait to try hemp pancakes and other treats soon. Obviously a family related labor of love that seems to be going gangbusters on the weekends."
The food is amazing! Great place to try something out of the ordinary. The food is very gourmet but with a streetlike twist. And Doug takes your order!
"This place is great for vegetarians. My favorite thing here was an artichoke salad. The burritos are very good and the prices can't be beat, but the atmosphere is a little weak."
"Went here for a friends rehearsal dinner. Not impressed. Salad was wilted, pasta was tasteless, deep dish pizza was dry and tasted stale, and finally cookies were hard as rocks. I don't get the hype."
"Finally!!! It took me a long time to find a restaurant like Nana...but it was worth the search! It's rare to find a breakfast/brunch place with such an amazing menu. This place takes breakfast to a whole new level, never again will I be satisfied with just plain eggs and bacon when I can have out of this world dishes such as the nanadict or eggs benedict crab cakes that are to die for! Not only is the food delicious (and all organic without the organic pricetag!!), but the place is so inviting and beautifully chic without feeling stuffy or pretentious. And then there's the staff. The first time I went to Nana I was served by a beautiful and super sweet girl who I later found out was the owner's sister. She went out of her way even on a busy weekend to make sure my picky 4year old got exact"
Crepes to die for. ��Great coffee.
"Alinea is truly an extraordinary, once-in-a-lifetime experience.Service is outstanding. Decor is simple yet intimate. Not a big restaurant which I think is important to not overcrowd so you can enjoy the experience. Went with my boyfriend a month ago. We got the 24-course tasting menu with wine pairing for both of us, which I do NOT recommend. 2 wine pairings are a bit too much because we both got pretty drunk towards the end.. haha. Also not recommended to help your boyfriend finish some of his drinks. So for couples, I recommend just getting 1 wine pairing for 2 people.Hopefully I'll be able to go again soon!"
OK... the food was good but nothing to go back for. I don't know why everybody gets excited for a sandwich finished off in the oven. My sandwich was over salted and the bread was so hard it cut my mouth. If Rick's name wasn't on this place with the exact same food it would go out of business. Really! Do you all like over paying for a sandwich you can easily make at home with a can of SPAM.........YEEEEEESSSSSSSS! Get real people.
"Not only was the chicken crisp, but so was the attitude I got from the guy behind the counter. ��My husband and I arrived a little after 8:30 and despite the fact that there was a sign indicating that the dining room closed at 9:30, it was made pretty clear that we were not welcome to stay and eat. ��We found a bench a few yards away, outside, to enjoy our meal. ��Unfortunately, more disappointment ensued, due to the fact that the chicken just didn't live up to the hype. ��Poor service and lackluster flavor sum up my review."
"If you blink, you would drive past this place. Located in a very obscure place is the blue glowing sign of Sushi X. Parking is everywhere because..well there just isn't anything else nearby. We parked right in front at meters. Its a small restaurant with a huge project screen of anime, and the lighting is very dim with an atmosphere of a trendy lounge.Two of us ordered 3 maki rolls which was more than enough. Each roll is about 10 or more pieces with each piece being the size of my palm. Ok its not that big, but its big enough that you are embarrassed to put the entire thing in your mouth at once. Good creative rolls, around $12-$15 each. You aren't here for the sashimi, you are here to stuff yourself with good maki rolls till you puke. Come around 6:30-7pm, it started getting busy around "
"Went here for the first time after reading numerous reviews. ��I consider myself a pizza afficianado, so the visit was long overdue.Overall I would give the pizza a B-The service was unusual and not your typical friendly encounter, but it wasn't rude either....hard to explain.As for the pizza, I felt the taste of the dough was very good, but the main problem was that the pizza is 75% bread/dough. ��If you like this, then this place is for you. ��The sauce is okay and tastes like canned pizza sauce.Also, I feel like you have to get the pizza with meat otherwise the pizza itself is bland because of lack of salt.Positives: ��not too greasy, not too much cheese like other placesNegatives: too bready"
"Probably the worst restaurant experience I have had in quite some time. ��My wife wanted to surprise me and go to a Sushi restaurant (she doesn't eat sushi) so she ordered the steak which ended up mostly fat. ��She sent it back and the manager, Nook Rug I believe started yelling at us. ��Customer service was terrible and they refused to take the steak off the bill. ��In fact, we never even got an I'm sorry...just hurry up, pay your bill and leave.As for the sushi, it was ok, I would rate it a 3 out of 5 if I were in Wichita, but in Chicago I would expect much better."
"I ordered for delivery the other night. ��The gal who answered the phone was not only patient, and friendly (first time ordering, asked several questions) she was also very cheerful and I could tell it was authentic, not cause it was her job. ��The delivery guy was prompt, and also very courteous. ��Pizza was EXCELLENT, exactly as I ordered, and HOT, which is unusual most times for delivery. ��I will order again."
"I recommend the arugala pizza and smokehouse burger. ��All the beers are fresh and tasty.. ��I would give Rev Brew 5 stars, but the service is unreliable."
"Ehh, met some friends out here the other night. ?In terms of a fun place to visit I would recommend going at least once just for the throwback feel of the old speakeasy. ?It has the hidden door which makes a fun first experience as well as the nice velvet curtains, however once inside the hostess was a little rude considering that the weather was horrific and I was coming during the week when business was going to be slower anyway. ?All considering though the drinks were very well done and this place offers a nice change of pace from the typical bar scene. ?The upscale atmosphere is fun and the low key entrance makes you feel like you are in on a little secret but otherwise was just not all that impressed. ?Fun but have other drink options to try before returning."
Great food! We were a little nervous that we were hyping this place up after reading all of the reviews. This place did not disappoint!
"We were sat 30 minutes after our reservation time (arrived 15 min before reservation time). ��Waiter was over worked... very slow service. ��But as always, food was great.Steak was cooked perfect."
"I have trouble giving this place any stars because it really deserves zero. ��The waiter basically disappeared after taking our orders so for most of the night no one had any drinks at the table. ��They also forgot to bring the main course of our tasting to the table and skipped right over to dessert (the dessert also left something to be desired - a small chocolate square that tasted like nothing more than a fudge popsicle). ��Then when it came time for the check, the waiter was once again missing so we had to go up to the hostess. ��We even had to ask her for it twice! ��For a high end restaurant, the service was one of the worst I've seen in Chicago. ��If you are going to spend $100 per person, you expect to get some service. ��Save your money and go somewhere else!"
"I really like their sagnaki cheese here and their chicken riggati. I had never tried the chicken before last week but it was delicious. The wines from Greece are my favorite, especially the macadenius (sweet dessert wine). Its delicious when paired with my saganaki - OPAA!"
"We got there early to try some of their wine flights, which had several different choices. ��When we sat down I ordered the Monk fish and it was excellent, plus I asked the server to pair the fish with a wine and he brings over a Malbec. ��At first I was a little unsure about the choice, but after tasting the wine with the fish it was a great choice. ��The only downside of the night was where we sat. ��The restaurant was large and open, when we got there it was about half full and we sat in the middle of two tables where I could extend my arms and touch both people at those tables. ��We might as well sat at the same table. ��Besides that I would go back but definitely request a more private table."
"Love this place! ��Service is great...food is awesome. ��The prices might be shocking, but the quality of the food and portion size make up for it. The lounge/bar atmosphere is always entertaining...you get to hear live music, you get to watch handsome bartenders (male and female :)) make drinks with dry ice, you get to watch all the beautiful people do beautiful people things. ��Try the tuna tartare, the scallops, of course the steaks are great, but I am a huge fan of the lamb!!!"
Fantastic!..We met for a business lunch. I had the Vindaloo and it was simply fantastic. My friend ordered the salmon sandwich and he really liked it too..The service was great and the entire experience was awesome.
"Coast makes sushi taste like no other sushi in my opinion.Most people do find sushi pretty gross and disgusting because it is raw fish. In my opinion I absolutely love it and am a huge fan. I have been to many sushi restaurants in not just Chicago but many other states and so far i have found that Coast as ��my favorite. Everyone does have there own opinion about Coast but in my opinion I absolutely loved it. Everyone knows that if a sushi restaurant is warm and gross looking it most likely will get you sick. Not in Coasts case, yes the restaurant is freezing but that is the best thing for the sushi which means its fresh. As many times as i have been there the sushi has not yet disappointed me yet and they do always present the sushi very elegant and nice. Another thing I noticed about goin"
"I came here about two months ago, and never got around to writing a review. So when I saw this place rated 4 stars while I was yelping in Andersonville, I was a little shocked.I came here for lunch in the mood for some cajun. We were the only people in the place which should have clued me in. The experience was pretty downhill.I ordered some iced tea and gumbo. The iced tea had a fly in it, which I would have pointed out immediatly but the waiter disappeared until our food came out. Pointing out the fly in the iced tea resulted in an offer to repour the iced tea from the same cooler that the fly was swimming in! I declined and asked for another drink instead.When the gumbo came out it was liquid charcol. I've had a lot of gumbo and been to New Orleans a few times. I've never had runny gumb"
"There is a certain vibe that a restaurant that gets the concept and is trying to make it exudes. Enter Big Jones. Remember when restaurants didn't reek of corporate clustafug? Enter Big Jones. Once walked in for brunch, every customer in shorts and flipflops and the host looked like he stepped out of Hugo Boss ad. And once asked for two wines neither which they had, so waiter brought out third wine on the house.nice menu allows allows for light or entree style eating - whateva your creole loving ass desire."
"Mediterranean food that will make you feel as though you stepped into another country. ��Everything from the food to the atmosphere is perfect. ��I've only experienced nothing but good things with the staff and family. ��If you have a problem with Sultan's Market, you probably have problems mentally. ��This is an establishment that provides a great service with affordable, healthy foods. ��The only thing close is Pita inn and both have their own good things...but Sultan's has a sound business that should become a franchise--however, then it would get fucked up with the wrong franchisees. ��VEGAN friendly too."
"Mastros is beautiful and the steaks are awesome! ��If you go for no other reason, go and have the butter cake and then die! ��Only negative - turn up the lights - ��mood is one thing, practicality is another. ��The customers who are going to keep you going in January aren't the 20 somethings out for a special occasion - it's us 50, 60 ��. . ��somethings who need a little light!Beautiful room, great food, GREAT butter cake!"
"The prix-fixe dinner was very good - there is no ala carte option. Enough choices to satisfy a range of diners. We were promptly seated and attended to. The room is intimate and attractive and quiet enough for conversation. ��My Ono fish was too salty, but everything else was solid. The Mint salad was very clever and tasty. Our server could not have been more attentive or helpful. She guided me expertly through the menu and I was quite satisfied. I did not see any mention of a wine pairing on the menu, but I may have missed it - our server offered it to us verbally. My dining companion and I sampled some of the wines and sadly in this area we were not impressed. The white wine was served much too cold which muted its taste to blandness and the reds were simply not on par with the excellence"
"The menu was a bit overwhelming, especially for someone trying Indian food out for the first time. ��However the wait staff were helpful.I could see returning to India house for a date in the future. ��Not a bad place to meet someone for the first time."
"I'm just going to bullet point my issues with The Gage...there are a few...1. Service is hard pressed to explain/give food pairings for their wine. ?They basically give the same flavor profile for every wine. ?Medium bodied, nice tannins with bold fruit...(sometimes they mention something like dark cherries or something..but this is basically what you are getting)2. The management appears to like to stand around in their shirts and ties and just stare at the tvs in the bar. ?What about getting dirty and helping your staff with their drink orders that (i agree with many previous statements) take a while.3. When asking my server if i could get more water, he responded I'll get the busser right away. ?Hey why don't you get the water yourself, you have been standing by the wall for the last 20"
"Finally made it here after all the hype and talk only to be blah! I didnt think it was nothing special. typical lettuce and tomato type of sandwich on french bread. Nice cool decor. ok place but there are better Cafe's in Logan Square. I try them again some other time, maybe it was just an off sandwich."
Best salad bar I've ever had. Love love the none stop meat... Excellent place to dine with big groups.
"We love this place. Most of us in the group are meat eaters but this place still holds up. Very very tasty. They seem to do frequent menu changes, which is neat, but you do start to miss classic dishes, such as fiesta polenta."
The best tacoria (ok so I can't spell it) in the city.
"We brought friends here from Mexico, I'm Romanian and my boyfriend is Mexican and we all had a WONDERFUL time the food was just like my mom and grandma makes the service was impeccable Branko the owner was more than hospitable, just like we were in his own dining room. Plan on having my birthday here oh and Anna sings beautifully!!! I can't wait for it to be nice outside it looks like a nice outdoor patio!"
"Hmmmm ... how do you rate a place where food was very good, service very attentive, but the music and volume level made your ears bleed? The place was packed with plenty of lively conversation providing natural ambiance but the place felt compelled to keep increasing the music volume so it could still be heard. Even our server apologized for the volume level. (The restaurant patrons were all my age and older -- 40+ -- with plenty of discretionary income and I'm sure the same tolerance to volume).I doubt my friends and I will return. Sad."
I LOVE NUEVO LEON!! The enchiladas suizas con mole y pollo!!! my favorite thing and the mole i have been eating there mole forever!!!!! ��i love it its my favorite in the city...ceasers has an awesome mole too but i have grown up on nuevo leons mole...love it here!!!!! love it!! ic ant get enough and its cheap as dirt too!
The food is absolutely fantastic. ��Loved the atmosphere with great staff. ��It is one of those places that you never ��get sick of. I have been there at least eight times. I like to try different things and everything that I have ordered was delicious.
"Just went there on with 3 friends for dinner. ?We got there at 9pm on a Saturday night and were seated with no problem. ?The server was lingering around our table and we kept having to tell her that we weren't ready to order yet, etc., throughout the evening. ?We each had a savory crepe (pretty good but the crepe batter was too wheat-y). ?The soup starter was a nice addition on a cold night but nothing spectacular. ?Food came out quickly. ?We finished our entrees and ordered two dessert crepes (crepes were cold). Once we finished our crepes, the server came over and said, You can stay as long as you want but can you please pay the bill so we can close the shift? ?We said, Sure! No problem!, and started figuring out the bill. ?She came back before we had figured it out and we said we needed"
"I went with four people, we all got different things and I got to try a bite of it all. ��The chicken we all agreed was great. ��The Wagyu and Halibut we all found to be good, not great. ��The lamb was just ok. ��We tried three desserts and two appetizers as well and they were all amazing.The service was great, very friendly. ��The atmosphere was great. ��The presentation of the food was great. ��But the food was just good, not great. ��At this price, I expect the food to be great. ��I would give it 4 stars, but the thing that really bugged me was that I left the place still very much hungry. ��The portions were tiny."
Great Food Service and Atmosphere. Perfect for a quick lunch or a dinner with your significant other. Their service is top of the line and they make sure to take care of every need.
"Hands DOWN, best place in the CITY for breakfast, lunch and dinner!I LOVE LOVE LOVE the breakfast and the seafood is always AMAZING!Could not recommend this MORE:)"
"Great Breakfast & Lunch Spot.. I love going to this place, ��Yes there is always a line (depending on the time you go) but it's worth the wait, alot to choose from and it hasn't disappointed me yet."
"I was part of a group of 6 who visited Grand Luxe last night, tues Aug 9, what a train wreck!! From the temperature of the place, the extremely long wait for the meal and the quality of the food, the experience was poor from start to finish. We all live in the neighborhood and have several restaurants to choose from. We will never return to Grand Luxe.I utilize yelp for restaurant reviews, especially when I am traveling. I rarely post a review, only when a restaurant is outstanding or poor. I had to post my disappointment with Grand Luxe and hope their staff makes improvements on their preparation turnaround time and the quality of their food. Turning the ac up from 60 degrees may help too."
Great anniversary dinner!
"Good food and good service. I went for lunch on a Sunday and it was packed--line ups out both doors. If you go alone or only with a couple friends then you probably won't have to wait too long because they'll seat you wherever there are seats, even if it means sharing a large round table with strangers (I sat alone at a table with three friends, a couple, and a old man). When it's busy, don't bother waiting for help to come around. Just get their attention and they'll be more than happy to help. The food was pretty standard fare for a good Vietnamese restaurant, and it came out pretty fast despite all the people. The price was fair although I've had cheaper for the same quality, but that's hard to find. Two spring rolls, vermicelli noodles with grilled pork and shrimp and egg roll, and ice"
"The thin crust pizza is to die for. Period. The sauce is perfect and the meats are so flavorful, this is the real chicago pizza. I discovered this place because there was a drawer full of menus left in my new apartment(20 menus gets you a free pizza). And thank God I tried it, because I haven't ordered from another pizza place since. Eating in is also really great; good atmosphere, decent wine list, and excellent pasta dishes."
"There are too many great restaurants in Chicago to go back here. The food was very mediocre. It's hard to go wrong with caprese salad, but their tomatoes were cooked and small. We had a side of broccoli that was totally limp & tasteless. ��Both of our dishes were bland (risotto and fish). ��Yes, the decor is very cute and the outdoor patio is fabulous, but the food has to come first. ��The service personnel also hovered, which is annoying."
"Living in the South Loop it's easy to get stuck in a rut going to the same place for breakfast over and over - Thank Heavens for YOLK! The ambiance is fresh, inviting and lively. Feeling like you're inside of a Swedish flag with the blue and yellow vibrant colors it's just a happy space to be in. Excellent menu choices and the BEST hollandaise sauce I've ever had in Chicago! Just the right touch of lemon in it - YUMMY!Great service, and excellent pancakes.Love it."
"You could not pay me to go back to this place. ��The server was absolutely horrible. ��I have never experienced anything so uncomfortable and never been treated so terrible in my life. ��The amount of money we spent was fine, however, the food was not even that good and the server actually talked crap about us in the corner the entire meal. ��For that money, i should be at least told 'thank you'. ��Not to add drama, but it was my mother's birthday (she is a chef) and her only request was to have dinner here and she even got a hotel to come. ��She was disappointed and my father was insulted by the wait staff. ��One star is too much. ��Never go."
The quality is worth the line. ��Dont go here unless you can afford the time. ��Especially recommended if you are out of town and want to eat some good stuff.
"The server, Diacos tried to steal my money!!! If you have the misfortune of having him for a server beware. ��I gave him the bill with twenty dollars in it and my card, he added the twenty dollars to the total and had the audacity to take the twenty dollar bill as an extra tip!!! All of this while not making eye contact or apologizing after this fiasco. ��The food is four stars. However, the service was appallingly horrifying which ruins the overall experience."
"I've experienced better. ��I've eaten in Middle Eastern restaurants in Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis and around Europe, and this was average at best in terms of food and service. ��Friendly clientele though. ��Perhaps that's more a reflection of the good location."
"always a win. ��glad they secured the building next door where they'll do some beers, mostly wine, and mediterranean food. ��hopefully spread the crowds out a bit."
"Totally wrong place to go. ��We were there for a birthday party a year ago and my bad impression will never blend. The owner is just in wrong business. That guy is not friendly neither then he tries to justify his attitude. He asked the birthday girl to pay the bill prior he served the food !??? ��I had hard time getting coke or mineral water that supposed to be included in the price B-girl paid per person. He came to say, that I shouldn't make pressure onto waitress and I should be more patient. The food in quality was ok but not in quantity . Even though the restaurant was empty he did not let us seat in the main room, as he set the tables for 40 if us in kind of hallway. He interrupted the musician who was playing for us (voluntarily) .... he thinks it is cool to help ladies climb on the "
"Spending an hour at Piece is a thoroughly enjoyable way to kill some time. The pizza is surprisingly good, and the place has its own microbrews! There's nothing like drinking some house specials and washing it down with a solid red pizza with pepperoni! They have several wide-screen TVs tuned to sports, so you don't really even have to bring anyone you care to listen to in order to be entertained! I'm a fan of the Worryin' Ale. I have yet to get there when they've had their stout available, but I hear it is excellent. I'm even a fan of their white pizza, which ordinarily I do not much enjoy. Only downside to this place is that it tends to get very busy during peak hours, of which I am not partial to. For a quiet brew and pizza, there's nowhere better in the city."
"I had a wonderful experience at Little Bucharest Bistro. The live music is magnificant and sets a very intimate and lively atmosphere. The owner, Branko, is extremely friendly and personal with all of his customers, in addition to his hard-working staff. ��Everyone in the restaurant seems to be having a great time everytime I go there. The new menu is delicious - my favorite item on the menu is the vegatarian goulash. I highly recommend going to the Little Bucharest Bistro!"
"Just because your restaurant is in Logan Square, does not make you good. Example: Longman & Eagle - showed up at 7pm Monday, restaurant half full. Service was unexpectedly confused and slow...Kitchen was really slow (people at tables who came in long after us, got their food first). If you want real good Gastropub fare, I suggest Publican. Because Longman & Eagle straight up failed!"
"Three words alone are enough for me to keep coming back: ��""Truffled Kobe Sashimi"". ��It doesn't get better than that -- although there are many other excellent items to compliment that. ��An excellent experience."
"What is not to like about Anteprima? ��A friendly neighborhood restaurant with decent food and service? ��One word from our recent ��visit on a Saturday night: LOUD. ��Unbearably LOUD. ��So loud we could not hear each other talk. ��So loud we could not hear our waitperson and she could not hear us order even when we were almost shouting at her. ��So LOUD we almost left, and we should have. ��The food, as usual, was good, but for the prices they charge, a little more concern about the dining atmosphere--the acoustics of the room and the amount of people they cram into what is a small restaurant--should be shown. ��It was an unpleasant experience for ourselves and visiting friends, and we will think twice before going back. �� Food: ��three and a half stars. ��Atmosphere: ��no stars. Be warned. ��It was l"
"Like all the other reviewers say... the dim lighting, the close quarters make this a great place to take a date. ��If you've never been to a fondue place before, I'd say that you should take a date here to impress him/her. ��But seeing as I HAVE been to a fondue place before, Geja's was just A-OK. Service... impeccable (we always felt that we were being taken care of and didn't have to wave anyone down)Food.... so-so (and that's only because I am comparing it to La Fondue in Saratoga)Ambience... romantic"
"This is in my top 5 favorite restaurants in Chicago! I love the food, and even more the atmosphere. Some of my favorites are the Atun and the Pollo Estilo Billy...last time we were in the waitress recommended the Ropa Vieja appetizer...loved it! And always have a raspberry mojito, they are the best!"
"It was Chef's Week this weekend. I knew I came to Chicago for a reason. And The Gage was the best choice for a restaurant on Saturday night. We got there late, but the elegant restaurant was still full and the staff were warm and inviting.At the candle lit table, we had two big glasses of Domaine de la Solitude C��te du Rhone - c'est fantastique! Not to mention a certain waiter with a smokey voice had an extensive knowledge of the wine list AND spoke french. We purred.Be sure to ask for Justin at The Gage. He's as good as waiters get -- very attentive, charming, and knowledgable about all the drinks and dishes offered. If we needed anything or were even thinking about ordering another glass of wine, he was right at our side. We liked that.The food? Orgasm in my mouth. Not joking. I had quai"
"Great service. Great food. ��Recommend everything in the sushi bar, crispy pata and the seabass in curry."
"I am addicted to brunch. ��Nothing tops off my weekend more than rolling out of bed, throwing some clothes on and entering a world of eggs and coffee. ��The truffle omelete is amazing, the service is great and I love the vibe of this unique intimate cafe. ��I have been all over this city searching out the best brunch spots and I feel like I am in on a secret with this find. ��No hour long wait, cold eggs or flagging down servers for a refill. ��Every detail from the coffee to the filet mignon benedict is top quality. ��I like the fact that you won't find salt and pepper on their tables because everything is perfectly seasoned. ��I love this place and the enthusiasm of the small staff for their new cafe will surely make you want to return."
"I first stopped in for a hot chocolate and a churro. Phenomenal. I returned months later for dinner and my first bite was like the scene from When Harry Met Sally. Everyone was looking at me. I couldn't help it. Everything is organic, the sandwiches are sooo good and still, even in the summer, I hope they serve the hot chocolate. It's that good!"
"I just moved here from NYC baby so this is my first review of a Chicago place because I really liked it. THere was a line outside which is always a good sign to me . Once the ladies and I got inside it was great . Wonderful drinks , hot guys . I think I can learn to like Chicago ! Thanks for making me feel at home violet hour ;)"
"We went to L&E for NYE brunch today. ��The food was very good and the quality of the ingredients used was outstanding. ��But where food is their forte, the customer experience piece seems to be lacking presently. ��We arrived about 20 minutes after they opened and were seated promptly by the hostess, yet from drinks to food orders things just seemed to be amiss. ��Items were frequently forgotten even after multiple requests, special dietary requests seemed a bit daunting (nothing annoying or super-specific, but I'm pregnant so I just asked for no soft yolks on my eggs), and our food arrived to the table a bit cooler than desired. ��I will say, however, that what our waiter lacked in efficient customer service strategies he made up for with a pleasant personality and an amiable smile. Overall ev"
"Wow, what a find! ��I always drive by this place and always see a line out the door, so I figured, what the heck, why not check it out.First the negatives: ��The wait is long. ��The place is BYOB which I love, but there is no place to have a drink while you wait despite the many signs that say no drinking while you wait. �� When we were finally sat, we asked for some glasses for our wine, and they brought us these 32 oz plastic cups...We asked for wine glasses or smaller glassware, but they said they didn't have any. ��This place really needs to get some glasses. ��Ok, thats it for the negatives.Now for the positives, the server was super nice. ��We started with empanadas. ��We mixed and matched some beef ones, some sweet potato ones and some chicken ones. ��These were bomb, especially the sweet po"
"This place it great - really tasty food, very reasonably priced (great lunch specials) and an owner who takes huge pride in his restaurant. ��Don't walk, run to this place!Plus if you read the screwed up story of what the partners did to the chef/owner you should support this local place as much as you can.p.s. There are always groups of good looking woman there to add to the ambiance."
Delicious
"i'm easily going to roll with two stars for this restaurant. ��very surprised to see all of the four star ratings of bonsoiree on yelp because this is one of the most disappointing experiences i've had in chicago. ��nothing went horribly wrong and i actually enjoyed myself quite a bit; however those joys exclusively reflected the wine and my company. ��the service was not very good, not atypical in this town, but i was really deeply disappointed in the flavor of the food and the price i paid. ��no course produced any harmonious quality. ��each was either under seasoned or overcomplicated. ��i actually went out for a real dinner after this one was finally finished. ��i will neither recommend this restaurant to a friend or ever eat here again."
"The food is pretty good, but I have come back time and time again for THE SERVICE. There is a gentleman who greets us every time, and brings us water and arranges chairs for us to sit while we wait for a table (very popular place). He and the staff are so attentive to our every need. All other restaurant owners, managers, and waiters could really take a cue from Simply It."
"I eat here at least twice weekly and the service is fast and excellent. Daily homemade soups that are really good. ��Entrees and sandwiches come with a choice of soup or salad. ��Their salads are fresh and filling. ��Try their Diablos tacos! ��The cafe is a great place to meet people, read, relax, study and they don't mind if you stay awhile. Don't forget about breakfast! ��It is busy, but you can get in while others wait at other restaurants for hours. They show local artwork on the walls."
Excellent service. ��Attentive staff. ��Menu filled with authentic Greek food. ��Ambience ... top notch. ��Valet your car and enjoy the experience. ��I've been going for the last 20+ years
"My boyfriend & I live in the neighborhood and make it a point to stop in at least once a week and have done so since q opened their doors. Perfect service, amazing food. Never disappointed."
"I was visiting a friend in Chicago and she'd mentioned the Violet Hour as a place she absolutely loved, so I was excited to try it. ��We got there soon after it opened (it wasn't busy at all), dressed up, and sat at the bar, where after getting our drinks, we were thoroughly ignored for the rest of the time there. ��Our bartender, Henry, walked by us multiple times, purposely looking away, with our beverage glasses sitting empty. ��After about thirty minutes of this, we called him by name to get our bill, and took off. ��We have no idea why he acted this way, but were completely unimpressed. ��The drinks were fine, but the experience was ridiculous. ��I've never been treated that way in my life, and I'll never go back, nor recommend it to anyone I like."
I am a fan of this place! ��They have great Casado people! ��You definitely have to check it out!
"ive already been there 4 times and its been open 1 week...cons?1. it was a little hard to find with no sign, but i guess i am on the internet and do have the ability to google an address.2. the music was really quiet. the tunes may have drowned out the conversations i get wrapped up in while eavesdropping on the tables next to me. im nosey.Pros-1.the place looks great2.i hate taking a bunch of leftovers home but REALLY hate ""small plate"" places where i blow $40 on nothing.3.its nice to be a little fancy at 2pm on a saturday4.3 of us ate well for $405.the kids there looked like they were having fun6. they were sat far enough from me and friends who needed to swearand have a cocktail7.we are still talking about everything we ate on sunday, and its wednesday."
"I am an avid fan of vietnamese food, but often cant get up the energy to make the trek all the way up to Uptown. Finding this restaurant with some good reviews I decided to try it as it is close to my house. The service was good, the appetizers great, the main course hit the spot, and the dessert was the highlight of the meal. The only drawbacks were the noise of the room, which as it filled up got extremely loud, and a menu that was missing a couple of my favorite items from Vietnamese cuisine. A final point, the decor and great ambiance makes it a good place to take a date which cant be said for most Vietnamese restaurants. Oh, and its BYOB!"
"Yes, their food is fine - relatively. And yes, their prices are just fine. No problems there. So why have I created this account and gone out of my way to give them one star? Because their service was absolutely terrible.If I owned this pace and saw how the waiter behaved at our table, I would've been extremely disappointed and angry. The gist of it was like so:We dared to ask our waiter where they source their fish from. I believe we asked whether he knows if their fish is typically farm raised or wild caught. He literally LAUGHED at us for asking and proceeded to lecture us that we ""have to understand"" that ""most everything"" is farm raised these days. We politely requested that he ask the chef regardless and he guffawed and agreed - when he returned he said something along the lines of """
Good basic Italian food. ��Great dining room atmosphere. ��Prices are very reasonable.
Tacos are great.
"After reading all the great reviews on yelp, I got a cake for my husband's 40th birthday party at Alliance. It was a 3D cake like they advertise on the website for a party of 60 people and I paid $450 in advance for it. I was happy to pay that much since the cake was a surprise and the design had sentimental meaning between us - and you only turn 40 once. The cake we got did not look at all like what I had ordered. It had icing running down and off the cake and the writing was smeared and unreadable. It looked terrible. I was so surprised and dissapointed for my husband that this was the cake wheeled out for him in front of all of his friends. This happened last summer and I still get bummed out thinking about that crappy cake we got."

"90 Miles has probably the best customer service I've experienced at a Chicago restaurant. They have created such a hospitable environment by entertaining their guests, and not treating them just as paying customers. By the end of dinner, I knew my waiter, the manager and the cook by name. They were willing to spend time going over the menu and gave their honest recommendations. While some customer service seems pushy and forced, I got the feeling that these people were genuine and authentic which I can appreciate. On top of that, this place has great food. I had the goat cheese and beef empanadas and a steak entree (can't remember the name). 90 Miles also isn't greasy and over-salted, which I've experienced in the past at other Cuban places. The outdoor patio and BYOB sealed the deal for m"
Great Atmosphere and Great Food..... ��Everything was delicious! ��This is definitely a place you'll want to treat yourself to while in the Windy City!
I love the jelly's and the juice bar here. Very fresh. Sometimes the service is not so great but the juicebar is great and so are the deserts I have yet to eat dinner or lunch.
"The food was amazing. I love how knowledgeable my server was. her name was Natalia. She knew so much about the wine list and what foods would complement the wine etc and so forth. She was very helpful and when the appetizer we ordered was sold out, she brought us another option on the house! It was incredible. We loved Natalia and we will definitely ask for her to be our server next time.Thanks girl!"
"The unique offerings of small plates here can't be beat... it's now one of my go-to places in the city. ��If you haven't been, check out the Pig - you won't be disappointed!"
I don't understand all the hype about this place. ��It was super crowded and when we finally got to our table it was dirty. ��The food is okay not a whole alot of taste to it. ��We ordered chilaquiles with eggs and they didn't even put onions or cilantro on top of it. ��The taste was bland and the plate didn't look appealing. ��Our three people group went for a working lunch and arrived when the lunch crowd had died out . ��So why is it that the manager asked us to give up our table since we were done eating and she had people waiting. ��She was extremely rude so I just said sure okay. ��Afterwards I looked around and there were empty tables and other customers were also engrossed in working lunches. ��I left like she had targeted us because we weren't dressed professionally and perhaps thought tha
"Bravo...bravo. ��A pleasant surprise from a modest place.  I don't review restaurants often as I'm very busy, but this place has it going on. ��Thursday night and the place was busy, I think I saw one open table. ��Any way let me start, the crostini thing with avocado --it was great and real fresh. ��The waiter, Dan, suggested we try the Stella salad with fresh raspberries and thin sliced apples. ��That was pretty good but no big deal-- we split it. ��What was really great were our entrees (the waiter also talked us into them). ��We had ��the pumpkin ravioli and the milk and honey ribs special. ��I loved my ravioli, I think it was served with some kind of burnt squash. ��My boyfriend's ribs were delicious, I got to try them but he wouldn't give up the rest when I wanted more--men!! ��Anyway, it was m"
"i love the restaurant's so much. i like Greek and Turkish food. the restaurant has fast services. we never wait . if you like Mediterranean food, you can go to the restaurant."
"Awesome restaurant, though the lack of room is keeping it from a full 5 star rating. The place has a great vibe, nice lighting and pretty yet simple decor. But there isn't quite that much seating, so when it gets busy, you get pretty cramped--we were literally separated by 3 inches of space between each 2 person table. ��The waitstaff was really attentive and did a great job. We even got complimentary lemonade on the house! Though it's not really necessary when you've got the no fee BYOB policy--a nice touch. The food was really good, especially the pho. Since visiting Vietnam, I have been searching for a place to satisfy my pho cravings, and Simply It did a fantastic job. It's a HUGE bowl of pho, that I could hardly make a dent in after our 2 appetizers, but so delicious. I will definitely"
"The atmosphere is great. The music they play is awesome: rare trax from earliest recordings of R&B. Perfect setting for organic/locally grown menu styled in a manner of southern cooking. ��Just awesome. The bar is great, and they know how to mix a drink. I've eaten here many a time and have never been disappointed. Brunch is the best. So much fun with a group, you and another or yourself. The staff is great too, service is always excellent."
"Edit #2: They canceled our redo dinner 2 hours before. We did not reschedule.--------------------------------------------------�_--------Edit #1: The restaurant staff did call me the next week to apologize for our experience. They offered to have us back to the restaurant to try again...which I thought was was very nice. Will update review after the second experience.__________________________________________________�________We went to schwa last night and had *hands down* the worst dining experience we have ever had in Chicago. I can overlook the fact that they cancelled our Thursday reservation 2 hours before dinner. At least they rescheduled us for the next day...annoying, but tolerable.The restaurant has a reputation for a laid back, laisseze faire attitude when it comes to service. Wond"
"Ruth's Chris is by far the best steak in Chicago. ��I am a steak lover and have eaten at most of the steak restaurants. �� Everything from the martinis to dessert is delectable. ��The filet mignon is absolutely perfect. ��The 500 degree plates and the melted butter makes the steaks, any steak, melt in your mouth. ��I have never been disappointed in any thing from Ruth's Chris. ��Their Caesar salad is awesome, as well as the mashed potatoes and lyonnaise potatoes. ��The service is incredible as well. ��We have had some of the most outstanding servers at Ruth's Chris. ��They always call you by your name, acknowledge if you are celebrating a special occasion and ��make you feel 100% taken care of. ��Ruth's Chris is the best."
This place is straight up nastayyyy! ��We walked into the bar and the bartender was hot. ��We were off to a good start. ��I got a burger served up and it looked pretty solid. ��I ate it and was pretty happy overall...that is until i saw THE ROACH. ��I nearly hurled. ��I pointed it out to my friend as it found a tiny crevice it walked into. The thought that I may have ate one of those with my burger was enought to ensure I will never be back.
"This is my 1st review on YELP, but I was just so disappointed. After having received dozens of those Neighborhood Coupon things at home, we decided to check this place out. We had a couple of friends in from San Diego to visit us. The best part of the meal was the setting,,it's busy, loud, nice atmosphere, and very comfortable, and we had a window seat on a nice night. That is about it for the pluses. ?The negatives were:1. Hostess was really robotic like, never looked us in the eye, and just did the follow me thing to the table. Our guests asked us is this Chicago or New York City??2. We placed our order with the waitress, average job on her part. In the meantime, me and my friend both ran out of drinks while we waited for her to come back...wait..wait..wait..3. App came..fine..Calamari.."
"The food is good. ��But not great. ��At least not for the price and the skimpy portions. Having had several meals under the chef's directions I can tell you that if choosing the chef's menu, you will be surprised once or twice, very pleased at least once, but disappointed at the end. ��You feel as if you were promised a magical journey of gastronomical delights, but then wind up with cheesy rice and cheezit crackers. ��Or popcorn sprayed lightly with truffle oil. ��Both easy and a let down. ��I expected more each and every time I visited (total 3 to give it a fair shake.) ��The service is American. ��The dishes are midwest haute cusine. The prices are more for NYC or Paris or Shanghai. ��Overall I think you should try it, but most likely you too (if you've had a bit of culinary exposure) will come "
"We went to the fifty fifty on Saturday for an engagement party. Our reservation were seated immediately. Our server Michelle was amazing- so attentive, gracious and personable. She made our experience so memorable. The food was great, drinks even better! We will return soon!"
"The food here was incredible. ��The spicy cabbage appetizer sent to our table on the house was how cabbage should be served. ��The restaurant is unpretentious and focuses on the basics...serving delicious food. ��The host kept things moving efficiently, and while gruff was also extremely welcoming and ensured that patrons got to experience a great dinner as soon as possible."
"My daughter and I ate at Brazzaz one recent Tuesday night while visiting Chicago and left with smiles on our faces and full of really great food. ��The service could not have been better and everyone was very attentive and helpful. ��The food was amazing, our favorite being their House specialty (roast beef), and the buffet was full of very tasty items. ��We even shared ��their creme brulee and enjoyed a specialty coffee. �� I definitely recommend going when you're hungry !"
"The outside of this place didn't look so good. However, the inside of it was actually pretty neat. I had bruschetta and cheese only pizza and they were descent. Will come back"
Food ok. Poor customer service.
"Ruth's Chris is a typical ""generic,"" Chicago steakhouse as far as atmosphere goes. ��The wait-staff is always attentive, and the food is always great. ��If you like lobster bisque, this might be some of the best in the city. ��I'm a fan of filet, and they do it well at Ruth's Chris. ��The sides are also great, like the shoestring fries, or the garlic mashed potatoes. ��If you like getting your steak spitting hot butter at you, this is your place. ��There is no better first bite of steak in the city."
I'm Greek and I can honestly say that this place is the next best thing next to my mom's kitchen!
WHAT THE DUCK????? That headline says it all. I have never been here before and heard great things about this place. If you have too DON'T BELIEVE IT! This was bar nun my worst dining experience since moving here to Chicago over 6 years ago. The worst service ever! After being seated it took over an hour to get our 1st dish (BTW- we waited 20 - 30 minutes for a table and ��tables were open and not being used). The other dishes arrived here and there over the next 45 minutes. The duck was decent but would pay double or triple elsewhere because of the nonexistent service. My first time here and definitely my last. My 11 year old could run this place better than the people working here.
this place is over hyped. the pizza is good not awesome or memorable.
"Service and food were fantastic. ��I felt my personal space was slightly invaded by the folks next to me, I think Mercat has fallen victim to the temptation to put in a few too many tables. ��However it's not possible to fault the food. Take the white sangria over the red."
Let's face it. ��Pizza can be hit or miss. ��This place was a hit in my book. ��It's all about the sauce and crust and this pizza was good enough for me to write a review about. ��Yum!
If I'm rating purely on the food/freshness & cleanliness I'd give 5 stars. The owner has a big big ego which isn't uncommon but it restricts my faithfulness. I'd recommend Coal Fire pizza any day.
"I went there with big hopes.Unfortunately,I was disappointed.The soup (I had lamb soup) came not hot enough,so I skipped it.The crepes,their piece of resistance,are so-so.If you're hungry,you should consider having two orders.That's what I did,and the second soup I had (it was pumpkin soup) was mediocre.The only good thing about this place is this:Icosium Kafe is BYOB"
"This is a good restaurant with very good food, but it's a little pricey for what you get. ��I'm not saying the food isn't good, because it is good, but what I am saying is that you could go to portillo's for a burger thats just as good for 1/3 the price. ��nice environment for working lunches, or an after-work drink. and there are cute guys, but they're married."
Worst pizza we have ever had. Had a burnt order before and this time It was burnt again and so hard we couldnt chew it. Will never order from Piece again
"I have lived in the neighborhood for over 15 years and was a frequent customer of the old Aliiance Bakery. ��I have tried this new one several times and have been very disappointed. ��The bakery is stale and dry. ��The staff is not helpful and rude. ��I was just there last week to buy a fruit strudel to take as a hostess gift and when we ate it, i was so embarrassed. ��The strudel was tasteless and stale. ��I also couldn't get the employee to put it in the proper size of bag so it would close. ��Frankly you can get macaroons anywhere these days and I've tried theirs-nothing to write home about. ��Cupcakes and cookies are also substandard. �� ��Aliiance is not a good bakery and I would really discourage people from going there. ��It is too expensive and their stuff is just not good."
"I definitely used Yelp to decide whether or not my hubby and I should try it annnnd we did. ��I was disappointed, but my husband loved it. ��I do agree that it's kind of trendy and it's definitely expensive. ��I don't think I'd go back again, but it's nice to say we gave it a try."
"The bar is interesting obnoxious people watching. Thought the brussel sprout salad, sashimi and rolls were decent. I think I've had better sushi in Lincoln Park and Edgewater though and at the price point, you really can't justify coming here unless someone else is buying. For a catch-up dinner with a friend, I would have rather stuck with Kamahachi or even Japonais."
"It's the closest food for me in my neighborhood, so it isn't much of a secret why I would try it out. What keeps me coming back is the friendly staff and quick service of the food. The menu is widely varied, I am still not sure why there are tacos on it, so there is something for everyone. Even dropping in for a glass of wine at the end of the day somehow fits...in my book that is a tough order for a place that does good breakfast business. You won't find the newest gourmet trends here, but that is part of the charm too I think. All around a great place to eat if you are in the area."
ordered a tray of spanakopita for a party of 10 peoplehow disappointing it was terrible wish they had better chefsit was 90% feta cheese and 10%spinach i feel they just threwa brick of feta in between the filo and baked it. that was a waste ofmy $55
Amazing! ��Definitely worth the trip out to Logan Square!
"Great food. They have this awesome Mexican-inspired sushi roll there (the name escapes me at the moment), but it's oooooh so delicious! Very inventive rolls. The atmosphere is very avant garde. They feature some very interesting paintings on their walls."
"I'm a Korean living in Lakeview and, trust me, there is no such thing as authentic Korean food here. ��You're better off making your way up to Lawrence Ave. or even the 'burbs.The bi bim bop at Crisp is mediocre at best with an unappetizing, runny, watery soup that collects at the bottom of the bowl after mixing everything. ��I can only guess that this comes from the washed veggies that aren't shaken free of excess water. ��Sesame oil is a key ingredient in this dish so, upon ordering, I made sure that it was included. ��I also wanted to get an impression of how far this place diverged from the traditional. ��They told me that the veggies are lightly seasoned with sesame oil before they're placed in the bowl. ��Lightly seems to be the key word here since I didn't taste any sesame oil at all. ��Sl"
"the food here is ok, but nothing special. i have had way better Pho elsewhere. their Pho have too much MSG i can taste it in my throat.. eww! but they have good fresh smoothie and fresh sugar cane juice; therefore they get 2 stars. but not a fan of this place... ""its over price for Vietnamese food."
"Food was amazing and great specials. Where in the wold can you get a 3 course rack of rib dinner for $11?? �� The only thing is, there was not much of an Italian feel, mostly mexicans working there........... and probably illegal ones at that."
"I've lived down the street for two years now, passed this place many times and went in for the first time yesterday with friends thinking it would be slow on a Monday night, wrong! We arrived put our name on a list and told we'd be waiting about 10 min. to sit. �� Well, we ��finally took our seats after waiting ravenously hungry aprox 30 min for our table. ��For starters, killer beer menu and our waiter was great, he pretty much picked out our meals for us from the beer on up to our dinners. ��The food was pie in the sky phenomenal- it just takes a long time to get it, a really long time. Fortunatelly our waiter was around plenty to bring us drinks, which were the only thing during our visit that arrived quickly and consistantly.For two salads a soup and a calamari we waited 25 minutes, our di"
"Overrated. ��Overpriced. ��too crowded. ��if you go there, you will have people standing over you while they wait for their table. ��Very uncomfortable. ��Very poor service and the prices are so much higher than most vietnamese restaurants nearby. ��Go to Pho Lily. ��food is fantastic, people are great. ��Tank noodle, well I would not recommend this place to anyone. ��totally overrated....."
"A little pricey but the food is really good, my favorite so far is the country skillet. Unfortunately walking back to the office is really hard after gorging on this feast."
"We lived right down the street from this place and I was tempted to go everyday, especially since the street fills with delicious smells that taunt you every time you walk from the Argyle stop. This restaurant baffles me because it is crowded all day, every day, even during off-peak times.The food is great, there's no denying that. But, I can't say it's particularly better than the other Vietnamese places in Southeast Asia town. I think the atmosphere contributes to its appeal, it's very casual, affordable and quick. I recommend the beef vermicelli noodle bowls, I could eat that every day of my life!"
"Their food is fresh and creative and very, very tasty. The Kani Chung roll is my favorite. I generally order carry out or delivery because the service is hit or miss and it's a very small place with lots of noise."
I am a big fan of Greek cuisine and I am really happy with the choice I made to go to Greek Islands. There were so many amazing sounding dishes to choose from that it was a bit overwhelming at times but I was able to sample a couple good items off the menu and would love to go back and try more. The flaming saganaki is always one of my favorite appetizers and this one didn't disappoint. The vegetarian mousaka was delicious as well and I can't wait to go back with friends and try more dishes. Service was also fast and very friendly.
I had beans and rice with dessert which was not to my satisfaction.I am satisfied with the cooking and hospitality.The atmosphere could have been better with less noise and clutter.Morning breakfast was good.
amazing food experience. try it at least once in your life. I am from chicago and I am proud to have this restaurant in my city.
"I've been wanting to try this place forever - glad i finally did! ��We all started with drinks - mine was a martini with papaya and was delicious! ��I ordered the vegetarian comal and it was GREAT. Tons of grill vegetables (mushrooms, beans, squash asparagus, etc) with tortillas, a couple sauces and sour cream. ��I wish I could have eaten it all but there was so much I just couldn't. ��Don't know about desserts, we were all so full from dinner we took a pass - my two companions ate every last bit of their entrees. My only complaint would be that they have a surprisingly small number of vegetarian options (maybe just one?)But I'll definitely be back."
We had never had Ethiopain food until the other night. Very interesting long menu and the taste of the food was phenomenal. We sampled several items and all were good. Go try this place out!
Not to many places in the south loop area that has a good breakfast but yolk so far has been one of the only places i have checked out. The food has been consistently good I have tried a few things and enjoyed everything. The pancakes are as good as anywhere I have ever eaten or better! Skillets have been very tasty and filling if your in the mood for something to fill your stomach. My only complaint is that the service has not been what I expect at a good breakfast joint specially when you are paying higher than normal prices for eggs and pancakes. The last 3 times going in I waited to long for the waitress to come up to me and ask me what i care to drink. As its early in the morning I would love to get that first cup of coffee. I have sat at the bar once and booths the other times and al
"Really really good mexican food. Their steak quesadillas are to die for. Service is always fast and pleasant. If you dont mind paying for parking, I highly recommend this restuarant."
"If you wanna try the best Brazilan steak house, you must go to Fogo de Chao. i went on friday for lunch, the place was kind busy, but the staff work very efficient. The best meats ...way better than Texas de Brazil or Brazzas. ��Fogo is the original Brazilian steak house. number one!!!"
I love this roof top garden. ��Yeah! ��Summer is here!!!
Go on the weekends.They have Israeli couscous.It's fresh and healthy and clean.The servers are nice to look at.
Food is good but rather pricey.
"Atmosphere - fabulous, trendy with a modern vibe.Service - no complaints.Food was amazing and inventive! ��The favorites of the night were the oxtail potstickers, beef lollipops, and the crispy pata. ��My girlfriends and I ordered dishes and ate family style so we could try multiple items on the menu. ��Sushi was fresh, but not the best in the city - would definitely come back here again but to try more of their entrees. ��Cocktails...my gf absolutely LOVED the Kung Pao Mango. ��Had a sip of it and it was very fresh tasting."
"I loved it, such bright colors!I had the ropa vieja appetizer which was amazing and then the pernil which was pretty good as well. My friend had the guatamalen-chicken and it was delicious as well. Definitely going back to try some more dishes. PLUS they're green! They use sustainable products and try to get most of their ingredients from local vendors."
"The Mayan Palace is your middle of the road Mexican joint. ��Nothing fancy, but good Mexican food. ��The place is set up really nice and decorated tastefully. ��The staff is really friendly and makes you feel welcome. ��The food is good and there is lots of it. ��It's not the best Mexican place in the world, but it's good for a nice casual meal."
"I'll admit it. ?I'm a pizza freak. ?I've built the woodfired oven in the backyard, and have inspired others to do the same. ?I know my napolitano pizza. ?This cat has nailed it! ?The caputo flour crust, san marzano tomato, meaty enough for the general public, but still....that art. ?What a sight to behold.A friend heard I was visiting my brother in Chicago and said you have got to hit this place. ?I would not let my trip from CA go wasted. ?Our family of five walked out of there with giant smiles. ?Please.....please head in and order yourself a big red wine, and at least one pizza per person (these are small artisan pizzas......it's about the flavors, not the gut). ?The freshness is over the top. ? And if you're a critic....this place is a HUGE bargain.A really comfortable neighborhood. ?T"
"Went on a Friday night and was able to sit on the patio without any wait. The waitress was kind and spent time explaining appetizers and pizza to us, since its all italian we had no idea what half the ingredients where. Food came out quick and while we where waiting we got some cheesy dough thing it was yummy. ��Will definetly go back."
"I have been there on several occasions. Their service is slow and I believe I did not get the same type of treatment because I am not Hispanic. The food is decent, but I won't go back because frankly I think they are racist. 305-ww"
"Generally speaking after a half dozen well crafted beers who cares about food, right? Wrong, these guys do a good job across the menu - from kick butt burgers to slow cooked pot roast with all the fixings. Oh yeah, and the beer is on track with the emerging scene.Cheers to Revolution Brewing."
Comfortable atmosphere indoors and outdoors. �� Have been here three times and always enjoyed talking with the people sitting near me. �� Fresh menu selections.
"Best stuffed crust pizza ever! An inch and a half of pizza, and two layers of crust - delicious!!"
"I was having a pizza party and for 7 weeks prior to it, along with some friends, I taste tested 7 different pizza establishments. ��The Art of Pizza came in second.........really really good and nobody has heard about this place. ��It's about time they become well- known!!!!!"
"don't be a bitch. don't complain about the line. don't complain about paying cash. if these are your beefs, you are an idiot. all i gotta say is duck fat fries get creative, order something crazy that you can't do somewhere else.bring a friend to talk to while you're in line."
"Won't be going back to this place. ��Ambiance is okay, nothing to write home about. ��That wasn't the deal breaker though. ��Went there with my wife and we ordered a reasonable number of tapas plates for two. ��Well, not only was the service extremely slow, but it turns out that we were waiting for our last 2 dishes forever. ��By the time I spoke to our waitress about it, she goes to investigate and comes back telling me that the order was never put in. ��She said if we wanted to wait, they would prepare it but it would take another 20 minutes. ��Well by that time, I was totally ready to get out of there. ��Perhaps I would've thought differently if the food was good, but it wasn't even that, not to mention the exorbitant prices. ��Never again."
"Great food & service. I've returned many times and brought friends. They make their own tortillas that are awesome. Some of the portions can be overwhelmingly large. Top picks for dinner: Duck, Pistachio Chicken . The specials are yummy too. I've been for dinner lunch and brunch... dinner being my preferred menu. The value food quality ratio is very high. This place is a deal for this kind of quality."
I Love this place! I walked by this place a dozen times before i realized it was an actual bar/lounge. No windows and no sign but i think it makes it more interesting. The interior is amazing the drinks are equally amazing. I give it 4 stars because it is a bit pricey but i guess i understand why these are not your ordinary drinks you get anywhere. Great place to take a date.
Great food and atmosphere. The bar is large and comfortable. The menu changes seasonally and they grow produce on their roof. How much cooler can you get?
"The pizza was great -- I love Neapolitan style, and they had great options and ingredients, and good salads too. We sat in their newly opened back room for large groups. It was gorgeous space and a perfect setting for a large-ish group. The complimentary Prosecco was a nice touch, too! Thumbs up all around."
Great pizza and great beer!I came here for a work party and they rented out the front area for us. ��It was a great time! The pizza was amazing and I loved the variety of beers they had with entertaining names. ��Great service too- our glasses were always full.
Doug has the best sausages.Friendly service. ��Fun lines. ��There is nothing on this menu I don't love.Call the Doctor I need a bypass.A must for all
"Love the Wilde Burger, love the Masc N Cheese and love the bar itself. The staff is friendly and the food is always good. Winter is coming so it will be time to hang out in the ""liberry"" section next to the fire with a Guinness."
"So I recently went in to Wilde for lunch, giving it another chance after a disastrous opening night experience. The waitress came over and pointing and waving her finger from side to side at me and my brother, stated ""drinks?"".. Uh, do you mean what would I like to drink? To spare you from boredom, the rest of the experience went something like this. Bland Jack Daniels Wings, no flavor whatsoever Cold French Fries Wilted lettuce on my sandwich Crappy Service. Total Bill for 2 Cokes 1 Appetizer 2 Chicken Sandwiches $45 WTF?????? Oscar Wilde would be ashamed."
"Short & sweet and to the point: ��Awesome.We came here and had an amazing dinner. ��Our waiter recommended the chopped avocado on crostini for the app and it was the perfect start to our meal. ��You get 4 of them--they were SO good! ��We also got Stella salads ��which had all my favorites in it--greens with apples and raspberries, provolone, pinenuts in a honey-mustard champagne vinegarette. ��Our entrees: ��lobster ravioli and baby back ribs. ��Both were so tasty. ��Homemade pasta and fall off the bone ribs--what more can you ask for??Great portion sizes and very satisfying. ��Dessert was the chocolate raspberry cake which was very rich and and very decadent (I'm not complaining). ��If you've never been to Sapori and your reading the reviews to see if you should go, stop reading now and just go! ��Yo"
"I ordered a spinach and goat cheese pizza and my server was extrmely nice and helpful. The pizza was the best, freshest one I've had in a very long time! Woo Hoo!!"
"Have wanted to dine here for over 10 years and finally made it, yesterday. ��Cutting to the chase, the food was delicious. ��Although in keeping with the previous reviews, the wait was long (around 30-40 min.) as we stopped in during prime brunch rush hours. ��GO EARLY is all I can say about that.After being seated, I must say our waitress was an absolute sweetheart. ��She was very attentive, even though buried in tables... ��I had the BLT eggs benedict, b/f had an order of eggs, chicken sausage and 1/2 order of white chocolate/caramel pretzel pancakes and his son had the chocolate tower french toast.My egg dish was very good, eggs poached just right with plenty of yummy hollandaise. ��But the star of the meal were those pretzel pancakes. ��Unbelievable! ��The white chocolate-caramel sauce was tru"
"This place is AMAZING. ��Wings are freshly fried when you order them, and they're not like those puny wings that you find at other so-called wing places like Yak-zies or even BW3 (which I still do love). ��These wings are Texas-sized wings that come in different sauces. ��Try the Korean BBQ or the Seoul Sassy. ��Best wings in Chicago, period.Jon, the manager, is also awesome - makes you feel welcome and always asks how everything was and what he could do to make the experience better. ��And he knows his stuff - we got to talking, and he told me about the different types of ways to marinate chicken, how to keep wings fresh and crispy, how they make their own sauce, etc. ��Go now and have the best wings, then thank me later :)"
"Yelp reviews are regularly on point - but they are wayyyyyyyy off the mark with this place! ��The great thing that happened was that my friends and I were seated right away on a Friday night. ��As the night went on, however, I could see why the place was nowhere near packed. ��Our food took over 40 minutes to get to us and when it came, one of the orders was completely wrong so our friend had to watch us eat till they got it together. �� Both orders of fries were completely cold (I was afraid to send mine back as I did not know how long that would take). ��Moreover, the waitress made more than one snippy comment each time she came to our table. ��The burgers do come on great buns and the topping choices are very creative indeed - but that is it. ��The meat was completely unseasoned I'm sure they "
The service here was pretty good. Everything we ordered tasted great; food and drinks! The floor set up and bathrooms were nothing special but were kept clean all night. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly.
Good food at a reasonable price. ��Close to my house so i find myself going there more and more.
service : Great !!! food : awesome - had a burger and salad + few appetizer ....parking: easy 2 find!!!WHAT A SELECTION OF WHISKEY WOWWILL be BACK!!!!
"Where do I begin. I went here right after Christmas after I received a gift certificate. I should have re-gifted. If you want to sit in a loud cafeteria and eat an over priced steak with a charcoal crust while you yell at your date this is the place for you! There is nothing special about this place, so if you want a nice environment and a proper steak for the same price, checkout the Chicago Firehouse."
i really like everything about Demera !! as an Indian i can say the food is sooooooooooooo...... ��there was a skinny waitress before which she used to be my serever since they started i didn't see her for the past weekends anyway the service also ��good but not like before i prefer the skinny old waitress . �� the food was so tasty. so please go and try it . you will love it. and the place is .........of course so beautiful.
"If there are two things in Chicago that there are no shortages of they are steakhouses and steakhouses. ��Mastro has a very cool bar area with nice decor and very expensive drinks to go along with it. ��I would be willing to pay more if they would please not put dry ice in everything. �� The food is in-line with the rest of the other high end steak places in town, better than Gibsons for sure. �� The service was good though I am not even sure how many different people served our table.The lobster mashed potatoes were the only memorable part of the meal."
"bad food and even worst service. to make it easy let me just say a few words. we were a group of 6 and we tried to order food., the server said we had to order drinks first. he would not take our food order. we started to order drinks and after 4 people ordered the server walked away and left the 5th person talking to himself.when the server finally came back and took our food order and we recieved our food it was horrible. the bbq pork sandwich was super dry. no sauce on it what so ever. we asked for a side of bbq and after waiting for ten minuted the server came back with italian dressing instead of bbq sauce.BAD FOOD, HORRIBLE SERVICE.the beer selection was the one thing that did look good until i ordered one beer and the server came back with something different because what i order wa"
"Love love this place. The atmosphere is romantic and chilled. The food is excellent. You have to try the BBQ shrimp and stuffed chicken! Every time I think about it my mouth waters. Also, the blueberry mojito's are great. One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago."
"This Sunday was my fourth time having brunch at big jones and all four times the food has been fantastic. Service has always been great too except for this time around. Our waiter, a very young great looking blonde was neither friendly nor attentive. Not only with us but with the the folks sitting next to us. He just seemed to be so bothered by everyone and made us feel like we were asking him to climb Everest every time we needed something. The worst was we asked for more coffee for the third time and he made a very loud sounding ""UHGH!"" We will returh but will NOT be sitting in his section."
"I would like to express my dissatisfaction in my last visit to Giordano's at East superior street, Chicago. ��I would start saying that I drive 200 miles to eat there and spend time with my family, but after I am greeted by your impolite and indifferent hostesses the experience turned from an excellent meal to be to an adventure.Let me clarify that I really understand the waiting time; however, there MUST be a better way to calculate the time in line considering that you can order ahead. I've been at this restaurant at least 10 times, usually with minimum 3 people; and 9 out of 10 the hostesses treated me like I was a vagabond that was asking for food, instead of a patron willing to have a good meal with his family. The customer focus and centricity needs to change; maybe you will not do an"
"Beautifully and intimately romantic! ��My wife and I agree that it is our favorite restaurant in Chicago for a romantic date night out. ��The food is exceptional, the service is professional, and the ambiance is phenomenal."
"I just took my husband here for his birthday and we had the BEST time! It was my first time dining in the cellar, though I've frequented the bar after work and have thoroughly enjoyed tasting my way through the wine list. ��Anyways, I have to say that from the moment we walked in, we were treated like VIPs. ��When I made my reservation, I had mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday, and the staff all did a great job of making it a special night. ��You absolutely HAVE to take advantage of the flights if you dine here, we had a great time trying so many different wines and cheeses. ��My husband loved his hanger steak, which was perfectly prepared. ��We also tried the tandoori chicken sausage and I discovered a new favorite...sooo good. ��We were happy with everything, left with big smiles on"
"I never write reviews, but for Nuevo Leon, I will. Lived in the neighborhood for about five years. Have visited numerous Mexican restaurants through out the city, this is IT. My favorite place to eat. The line is extremely quick, don't worry about your position in the line, if they can fit your group, but can't fit the others in front of you, they will seat your party. That's how it should be, right? Someone said this isn't very authentic, I don't know how much more authentic you can get... but, to each their own. Go here, you will never be let down. I haven't."
"My first taste of Costa Rican food and I liked it :-)I thought it would taste more Mexicany buy it was milder than what I expected. �� I had a steak burrito, 2 chicken tacos, and an Orchata. ��The seating was a little tight but I really wanted the outdoor cafe but the wait was 45 minutes, no thanks.Overall it was a good experience and I would go there again.Paul"
"The best Vietnamese food I've ever had.Service starts with complimentary tea (excellent). ��We ordered the Bon Vivant Platter (combinations of spring and egg rolls), the #8 Avocado Chicken, and the Simply It Beef. ��The Chicken was strong, flavorful, and amazing, and mixed extremely well with the the mango salsa. ��The beef was indescribable.Strongly recommend."
"Very popular place! ��I like the small portions, gave us chance t try a variety of dishes. ��Fun food."
"I have come here three times before, great place to go for nice dinner with a date or friend. The presentation of the dishes are great, and the food is amazing and full of flavor so it is worth the price you will pay. I would at least try it once if your curious you will not be disapointed. Make an excuse to come here!"
This place was probably the best breakfast I have ever had. ��I loved it. ��Everyone I went with ordered something amazing. ��The atmosphere was great too!
"LOVELOVELOVE coming back here. ��Very tasy martinis as always, and best food in the city. ��You cannot go wrong with ordering anything on the menu. ��Can't wait to go back."
"They have the best spicy tofu dish and Szechuan String Beans. ��I also love the lamb dish. ��I almost get these three dishes every time I go there. ��The branch in Downers Grove is also great. ��I'm sure they use the same recipes. LOL... ��The only thing they need is better services, friendlier waitresses. ��Sometimes they are kind of mean, too rush. ��But I still love their food."
"Until we check out Brazzaz, Texas de Brazil is AS GOOD AS IT GETS!I heard many positive words floating around about Texas de Brazil. So when the opportunity came to attend via GROUPON! I jumped at the chance. We decided to go on a Wednesday after work. I assumed it would be a very slow night because who else in Chicago wants all you can eat meat on a Wednesday beside cuisine connoisseurs such as ourselves? I was wrong. While it wasn't super packed there was a constant flow of people, which lets you know this place is as great as everyone is making it out to be!The FOOD: Fantastic. I decided to opt out of the salad bar. (Hey I figure I am paying $50 per plate for meat so I am going to consume as much as possible.) Our meals turned out to be worth every penny. I had Parmesan Chicken, Parmesa"
"The meat was delicious (I am not a big meat eater) good salad bar,big bill. I was seated on the dirty chair with bog drop of grease."
"My experience at Bin 36 was an all-around success. ��The food was delicious. ��I especially enjoyed the beet ravioli and was disappointed when I found out it was seasonal- guess there's always next year. ��The wait staff was very knowledgeable of wine and made me feel comfortable, especially since I knew very little- I was never disappointed with what they recommended. ��I loved the open atmosphere and even managed to meet a couple people while dining. ��I will definitely continue going to this restaurant."
This place was not worth the money. ��The food is not good. ��I will never go here again.
My new fav spot 2 hang out on Division St. ��Great specials and pretty good bar food! ��The patio is awesome in the summer!
"maybe we didn't order the best meals or it was an off night, but our food and apps were just ok."
"The garden is beautiful, I would love to sit there all day long, and, you would need to as the wait staff can't seem to find any tables. ��Food was not what I had hoped it to be. ��Crispy fried zucchini flowers were not, $29 veal milanese was in need of some flavor, but it took up the whole plate. ��I did like the lasagna though. We went elsewhere for desserts. ��Don't know if I will go back."
I love this place...
"RJ Grunts is the epitome of ""Hidden GEM"". �� I love this place. ��Probably my favorite restaurant in Chicago, and I've been to most of them. ��Small, and usually crowded but they pull it off with perfection. ��Great food, cozy wooden booths, great memorabilia on the walls, awesome retro music playing, and phenomenal staff. ��You have to try the Buffalo chicken Turbo nachos and the salad bar is the bomb."
"Excellent food, wine & deserts. Our dining experience great...I wish they took reservations!"
"My husband and I took my new mother-in-law to this place two days ago. I had heard good things about this place from a few people who said that it was a must-see, that it was high-class. Well, I was not impressed. The place was dirty. The first thing we noticed was the floor was sticky. When we were seated, we noticed that the spoon and at least two plates had dried up food on them. We told the waiter who nonchalantly apologized. I was humiliated. We wanted to take my mother-in-law to a nice, upscale place but instead we got nasty plates and utensils. I would never go back to this place and would not recommend it to my worst enemy."
"Came here on a Thursday night for dinner with three other girls. I'm a fan of the Rockit venues and this was my first time at Sunda with pretty big expectations.Friendly staff. Great enviornment. Great decor. Amazing food.Grabbed a drink at the bar first, around 6pm. Drinks are delicious, but not very strong. About $12 or $14 bucks, don't remember, but pretty average for the area.As for dinner...Rock Shrimp Tempura, Baked Snow Crab Handroll, Sunda Rainbow Roll and ""The Number Ten"". We shared everything and it was all amazing. Literally my mouth waters just thinking about ""The Number Ten"".. Some of the best sushi I have ever had..We also had a bottle of wine and edamame.Came out to about $40/$45 each without tip.Which is about $20 less than I was expecting to pay.Anyway, I will be back soon"
Had a great lunch at Sunda with a client. ��Earned some extra points with them for a great recommendation! ��We shared a couple of apps and 4 rolls...delicious! ��Loved the Firecracker!! ��Strongly suggest a lunch at Sunda.
"great cubano sandwich. ��I had the media noche (sweet bread), fried yucca w/ garlic topping. ��For dessert I had bread pudding and a cafe con leche. ��it was all terrific! ��homemade and delicious. ��would recommend. ��only drawback was that it was small inside but cozy. ��felt like i was in cuba for 30min. ��parking too!"
"I have eaten at Ras Dashen (hands down my favorite restaurant), Ethiopian Diamond, and now Demera.Demera is a beautiful space with lovely decorations, but more crowded, bustling, brighter, and louder than I prefer. ��It lacks the cosiness that I enjoy.The food is acceptable, but not nearly as good as the other Ethiopian restaurants I've been to in the city. ��Their spicing is different, almost sweeter, and I suspect there are regional differences in chefs. ��The injera is very good, and the Tej is excellent. ��Their appetizers and desserts are also excellent. ��Their entrees, however, pale by comparison."
"The first time I went to Big Jones, it was during lunch and we were the only table there. I don't remember what I ate but remembered thinking that it was really good food. Even though the bf had a piece of plastic in his food. (That should've been a huge clue!) The second time, I went with my sister. There was a 45 minute wait-- so we waited. The service was spotty from the start. The waiter forgot sis' drink, forgot the cornbread till we reminded him, then the manager (i think?) proceeded to spill the gumbo all over the table. After some debate, we sent the gumbo back because it was too spicy. It was replaced by the worst sandwich I've ever had. The pull pork sandwich did not come with a fried egg, like the menu promised, was completely rubbery and dry and drenched in a nauseatingly sweet"
"Best Margaritas yet...One more pitcher to go!!! The taco salad was so huge could of fed me, my friend and my fsmily. I will sure to be back. Was not surprise when I saw so many reviews for the place was jammed packed. We waited for about twenty minutes but after that it was margarita margarita margarita. Sweet and good. The best!"
"I love their brunch and now that it's down from $50 to $25, I really can't complain about the price. ��Their are a ton of choices including the standing buffet. ��I love their duck hash and I think the food is unique but the standing buffet offers a lot of the standard stuff like their delicious oatmeal and you can add just about anything to it."
"I've had the milk, but I haven't tried the honeys. ��But there sure are a lot of them."
"Combine great food, affordability, tremendous energy and you have the recipe for a terrific night out. ��I had the Portobello Mushroom for an appetizer, the Snapper Filet for an entree and the Key Lime Pie for dessert -- each was a winner. ��Our server was Raul and he could not have been more professional -- friendly but not over-bearing. ��The energy in this place is incomparable -- not haughty, but casual, friendly and dynamic!. ��We left at 10:15 last evening and people were still lining up for tables! A repeat visit is definite. �� (It is BYOB as well)"
Just confused.First time there had a great spanakopita. Second time it was terrible. It was more feta cheese than spinach and very soggy.Will give it one more try but I hope they improve.
"Loved the roof deck. Fast, friendly staff. Great cocktails. Unfortunately, I was not impressed with the appetizers i ordered."
"Delicious, but the buns aren't as good as they are at other places. Must try though. And make sure you have time for a nap later:)"
Love the hummus. Top notch service.
"If I can give this place negative stars I would. ?I stopped by there today at around 2:30 for lunch. ?The place was not too crowded and I sat by the kitchen area. ?I waited 30 minutes and no one came to take my order. ?I saw a few employees standing by the kitchen and they knew I had been seated for a long time and I asked them if someone was available to take my order. ?They said they were not assigned to my table and the person who was ...well she was taking care of others. ?Finally I left without being served and very angry.The employees there have a don't care  attitude towards the customers because the place is always packed. ?I am disgusted by the way I was treated and will make sure to tell my friends, co-workers and family to skip this place."
"AMAZING!!!! �� ��I've been to quite a few gastronomy driven restaurants...some have been mind blowing...some not. But Alinea was beyond!  �� It's days later and I'm still trying to tell everyone I see about our experience. But how can you really give justice t this whole presentation? I CAN'T!!! From the seaweed driftwood presentation, ��antioxidant elixer served in a huge chunk of ice, our desert having liquid nitrogen poured into it right on the table and then smashed into pieces by the owner of the restaurant himself to make an amazing mixture on the silicone tablecloth, to the peppermint snow and delicious morsels served on the end of a foot long wire...I'd have to say this was the most amazing place I've ever eaten at! �� ��Our waiters ranged from normal to pretentious...but whatever...the "
"Fantastic service and quality of meat. Every time my wife and I come here on date night, we get more impressed with the quality.Frequent spot for us to impress out of towners for business dinners also. Eclectic wine collection, try the bottle of Bordeaux awarded by wine spectator. ALWAYS a winner."
"Perfection on a plate!I love this restaurant, my boyfriend and I are always searching for new breakfast spots Meli Caf�� does not disappoint, even though it may be crowded the wait is usually not long. The service is excellent the food is delicious. I've tried the stuffed strawberry & apple French toast they seem like a sugar high but believe me it's just the right amount of sweet, the Mana Mou skillet is so good, and the pancakes are light & fluffy. This place quickly became my go to spot for breakfast, next time I go I'm trying something new so far everything was been scrumptious."
"Oh, what to say about this amazing place. ��We originally went there on a whim, and have been back countless times. �� This is a great place to meet friends, or just a date night out. ��It is BYOB, and the corkage is waived with a minimum order. ��The sushi is so great you will not have a problem surpassing the minimum. ��I highly recommend the popper roll, it is usually a special, and a must have. ��I would also recommend the crunchy spicy tuna. ��The chefs here do an amazing job at combining flavors and the presentation is equally as appealing. ��I have tried several sushi places, and this one still takes the cake. ��Another bonus is that it is only a few blocks from, Hot Chocolate. ��I suggest Coast for sushi and Hot Chocolate for amazingly inventive desserts."
"This is a great place. ��I eat here about once a month, either for lunch or dinner. ��I've never had a bad meal and never had to wait (although I have eaten lunch at the bar because there were no tables available).The lunch buffet is a notch above other Indian lunch buffets I've tried. ��They have plenty of choices, fresh from the kitchen, and the serving area is clean. ��On popular days, you'll wait your turn to go through line.My dinners have been delicious with large portions and great service. ��Last couple of times I had the vegetarian thali and it's too much to eat in one sitting."
Irazu is soo tasty! I wish that I could eat here everyday! Definitely check out the vegetarian burrito. It's enough for two meals!
"So I was at Q this Saturday night for a friends birthday. We had an 11 person reservation for 9 pm. I arrived at 8:45 so I could set up the table for the bday girl. It was obvious that they were crowded and overbooked. We ended up not being seated until 9:30 pm. We were asking the hosts for updates on timing when the manager decided to lie to us and tell us that they were running 15 mins late and our reservation was at 9:15 not at 9:30. This was a complete lie as I even looked over his shoulder and saw that it said 9 pm. Finally we were seated with no apology, no complimentary appetizer for our delay but fine, I let it. Then our waiter was completely overwhelmed and took about 20 minute to even get our drinks. I will say that the food is great which is I gave them 3 stars but their custome"
"I wish there were a way to select zero stars for this review. ��My boyfriend and I went there for lunch today (our 2nd time) and were pretty excited about it. ��Being lunch we didn't want to eat a lot so we asked how the salad bar worked. ��Our waitress explained it, including that if you order an appetizer it was 7.95 instead of 11.95. ��Great, were were already planning on ordering an appetizer and my boyfriend wanted something else so he ordered the salad bar. ��The food was ok, although he said the salad bar was nothing exciting (he had a side salad and some strawberry's that's it). ��When we got the bill I noticed we were charged full price for the salad bar. ��I questioned this with the waitress who tried to explain that it should be full price because I ordered the appetizer and he ordered"
"3 stars for the ambiance only.I went there with my fiance and we sat at the bar. Bartender was in my opinion very rude? well here is why: we ordered drinks and she was serving us like she was angry that we were there,no emotions on her face just very angry looking face. I appreciate a good customer service and in this case i wanted to leave after the first drink! At least say hi and smile.(you work for tips don't you?) we decided to stay (just because the jazz band that they had that night was great) and the second time we wanted to order, she wasn't even paying attention to us,mind you the place wasn't so packed yet, by the bar. and also why cant they hire a better looking bartenders! with more energy! and a smile on their face lol for Gods sake! the guy that was helping barback) was frie"
This place is so great the food is always good and the locations is awesome its such a great hangout spot as well. Ive never been dissapointed in the service its always the same great quality service and food
"First of all, any place that doesn't take reservations, and considers itself a real restaurant, is a joke. ?We waited 2 hours for a table, when we were finally seated, they sat us at some sorry, crooked table. ?The table was so crooked that when my girlfriend put her drink on it, it spilled. ?When we asked for another table, we were told that we would have to wait another 45 minutes. ?Upon showing our displeasure, and speaking with the manager, we were still not accomodated. ?Rick Bayless should be ashamed to be associated with this place. ?Rude management, and a unfounded long wait time. ?I will never go to another Rick Bayless restaurant again!"
"One of the best dogs in Chicago! =)I went here for lunch one day, and I come back just about 3 times a month! The service is great and is pretty quick, and the food is amazing! (From the Superdawg, all the way to the grilled cheese!) Maurie and Flaurie really got a good thing going for them! (I guess that's why they opened one in Wheeling, too!)Great resturaunt :)"
"My experience was top notch. ��Everything the waiter recommended, was awesome. ��I will definitely go back for more. ��Highly recommend. ��The service was impeccable."
great service and outstanding food. ��ricotta honeycomb is a must!
"This is a restaurant with a fantastic staff and owner who make you feel like you are in their home. ��And the food is fantastic. ��In reading the other reviews - most rave about the Pizza - and I cannot disagree. ��It is top-tier - cooked in a gorgeous wood fired oven imported from Italy. ��But for me - it was about the cheeses. ��Starting with the buffalo mozerella - imported weekly from Italy - was so fresh and lovely you could taste the subtle sweetness of the milk and the Italian grasses on which the buffalo grazed. ��My comment was 'it gives me the sensation of Angel wings' - and it did. ��It is that good - best I've ever had. ��And the imported prosciutto that was served with it was amazing and added a perfect richness to the lightness of the cheese. ��Ultimately, though, I forgot about the p"
"The food is amazing!! salads to burgers they got it all! i dont think there is a martini list but the bartender whipped me up a pomegrante maritini with berries in it, so good. Definately recomend this place!"
"On my most recent trip to Chicago, and my first trip after my conversion to full blown veganism, I was pleased to find several vegan dining options. My boyfriend and I went through the list and picked a few places to try, and thank goodness one of the places we put on our list was the Chicago Diner, because it was fabulous!There was quite a wait to get in to a table, but luckily we stuck it out. The servers were incredibly helpful, making tons of suggestions when we were both so overwhelmed by the selection. I ended up settling on the Black Bean Burger, which was absolutely incredible, and a cup of the French Onion soup. My boyfriend, a self-professed meat and potatoes guy, decided to go with the huevos mexicanos, and was pleased as well. I was a little apprehensive about bringing him to a"
"I wanted to give this place one star so badly due to the awful service and my fiance's meal, but I give it two to be just in the review, as the coffee was great.....that I had to actually ask if it is free refills as they never once (aside from the time I had to ask, after my cup had been empty for 10 minutes) refilled my cup/came by to ask how everything was/if we needed anything, etc.My fiance and I ordered omelets, in the middle of his were TONS of onions, which he didn't notice at first, as the start of the omelet was just egg - he had ordered cheese and sausage (incidentally, to add sausage or another meat to the already average sized omelet, is 2.99). ?Onions are neither of our friends. ?Pros: ?They offer wide array of cheese including goat cheese ? ? ? ? ? ?Coffee (and cream) is som"
"Absolutely fantastic place for lunch! ��I know that it is well known for dinner (as there are no other comparable restaurants in Old Irving Park), but it is just too long of a wait at dinner time even with a reservation. ��The food is really tasty and reasonably priced for lunch, but I had a pretty inexperienced waiter the last two times. ��The service during dinner is much better but I feel that the food is a bit on the expensive side for what it is."
"I tried Crisp after reading all the great reviews it recieved. I ordered the Chicken wings in Seoul Sassy, plain and spicy I also ordered the buddah bowl. I didn't like the buddah bowl at all. I thought the chicken was well seasoned and had great flavor, but that it was to dry. I have tried the place twice and both times the chicken was dry, so this is not a place I will go out of my way to go back to. I will say the guy behind the counter was fabulous....very friendly"
"Hands down my favorite Chicago pizza.I've tried all the tourist traps, and in my opinion, Pequod's is where it's at. Killer deep dish crust, amazingly fresh toppings, and a perfect sauce with just the right amount of kick. (I recommend requesting some fresh basil if you want a little something extra)As far as service, let me put it this way: I was recently in the area working on a record, and the staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating. We'd get done in the studio super late and then head over for pizza and drinks. We stayed well past close several nights a week, and without fail, they were always awesome to us and extremely welcoming. Thanks guys! You've got a fan for life!"
"Love Korean food! Love this place! the place can be very hectic and the lack of good service can be trying at times, but I do visit this restaurant when me and friends wants to experience great Korean food! So just try to be patience and grab any waitress that you can see coz they will help, even as far as grabbing the water boys if you need small things, they will help when they can lolThough, when you do go in the winter time, do not bring your coats in coz they will smell forever and ever. In the summer time, make sure that is your last stop coz the smell lingers even longer on your clothes.Sometimes, Cindy, the owner, even go as far as serving you herself and if you have any question on the food, she will explained how to eat and if you love the bbq, she even help putting and setting t"
Our night started with the hostess being very rude. ��You can't sit at the bar and wait for a table and they don't tell you that and after you sit down they tell you you can't sit there. ��The dining room is tiny. ��They can't properly work the reservations and the people waiting. ��The menu selection was poor.
"Best Sushi, love the BYOB!"
All I have to say is AMAZING Rooftop! GREAT FOOD!
"This place is amazing! I always go with the lamb meal and I'm never ��left dissatisfied . The hummus is excellent and the portions are enough to fill you up. For dessert I'd go with a baklava. This place id great for a bite with some friends, with the family, or just a quick bite by yourself. Try it once and you'll come back for more."
"Demera is the second Ethiopian restaurant that I've tried in Chicago and it's the one I prefer. ��The service has always been stunningly nice and very helpful. ��I sometimes still need help navigating the menu and they always explain what each dish is and make great recommendations. ��I too cashed in on the Groupon and took a friend who had never eaten Ethiopian food before. ��She was a little hesitant, but immediately liked the honey wine and the lentil appetizer that we got. ��I will agree with a couple reviewers that the lamb dishes had some stealthy bones, but we chewed slowly. ��I tend to be more of a meat eater, but the lentil and chickpea dishes at Demera are probably my favorites.The food has great, bold flavors and eating it with the bread is fun. ��I give Demera two thumbs up!"
"Do not go to this place unless you are korean or have a korean friend. i had no idea what to do at this place, staff did not help at all."
"I've been to Kinzie for a variety of occasions - quick lunches in the loop, and special occasions like Valentine's Day and anniversaries, and I'm always impressed with the food, wine, and service.For a chophouse, they have a great lunch selection. ��I love the herbed goat cheese salad, and they'll add grilled chicken or steak or other toppings to it too. We usually go to Kinzie for special occasions for a nice, inviting atmosphere. ��I've never gotten a stuffy or snooty feeling from any of the staff. ��Some recommendations - the cheese flight (amazing!!), the filet with a huge variety of toppings (I love the grilled mushrooms), and the mac & ��cheese side is oh-so good. ��The servers are more than happy to review all the different cuts of meat with you and explain the differences and the best w"
"I went here before for breakfast and was impressed, but just had lunch there and now I am a fan! Dan picked me up from work and we decided to leave the loop and head west into Greek town. I went to Meli before and enjoyed the food , so I thought.. lets go there! Parking was a little bit of a nightmare, but we parked on Jackson further east. The place isn't big, and I was short on time, but we must have had luck because our buzzer went off in less than a minute of getting it. The hosts were in suits and the waitstaff in all black, but the dining room was yellow and bright with pictures of cafes and flowers. Our table was close to the Juice Bar/Espresso Bar and the selections made my mouth water. They had wheat grass and different fresh squeezed juices coming from the barista/juice bar stati"
Killer food..Good guys and great atmosphere
"After having had the fortunate experience of dining at Le Colonial one recent Friday evening I thought I would see what other people were saying about the restaurant on Yelp. ?I have to say that I was somewhat surprised that a couple recent reviews were less than positive and must stress they are completely out of line with my experience. ?As a young professional who enjoys an exciting culinary experience when I go out to eat, I typically look for restaurants that do not fit the Downtown Chicago overly touristy bill, Le Colonial certainly delivers on that aspect. ?From the moment that I made reservations for my partner and I to dine at Le Colonial my experience with the restaurant and its staff was nothing short of spectacular. ?The person whom I spoke to on the phone was very accommodatin"
"Not worth the money. ��Not even close. ��I went here for dinner for a birthday. ��Came away spending $150 each for the 5 of us. ��I wasn't impressed at all. ��Now it wasn't awful...but I didn't think the food was flavorful at all. ��Sorry, I won't be coming back."
The salad bar is fantastic and the selections of the meats are very good. ��The server is a bit difficult to find at times when you want to reorder drinks. ��The price is a bit steep but great for large groups. ��Worth making a second trip if you are a carnivore! ��Stay home otherwise...
"I discovered this restaurant last year. ��Friends of ours had suggested this would be a great place to meet before a concert. ��Well, I am always looking for something different and I have found it. ��I have included Carnivale to my list of the best places to eat. ��The atmosphere is just wonderful. ��Even if there is a table available my husband and I like to sit at the bar for just one drink and enjoy before we sit down to eat. ��I love to watch the bartenders make their speciality drinks. ��The food is fabulous too. I always get the skirt steak and venture off when I order appetizers. ��I just love the fish tacos too. I had been raving about this restaurant to my family and we all decided to take my mom for her birthday. ��We did not have reservations and just headed there. ��When we got there th"
Cafe 28 has GREAT food. ��The ambiance is very nice. ��The service is pretty good. ��But my experience at this restaurant is usually compromised because they don't accept reservations. ��Almost every damn time I go to Cafe 28 I end up waiting 30-45 minutes in the overcrowded bar area. ��It's maddening! ��I highly recommend you try this restaurant for their great food. ��The ropa vieja and taste of cuba appetizer are particularly good. ��But I also recommend you avoid it on Friday and Saturday evenings if you don't want to wait.
"Food good, drinks good..BUT AACCKKK! ��The seats! ��They were awful. ��Way too low to the ground. ��I felt like I was in elementary school again. ��Can we please get grown up chairs???"
"My friends and I went to Wilde over the weekend and had a great time. ��The interior is really nice and the place is really big. ��I love that they serve late night food (please see Isabella W's review). ��The wings were really awesome and the fries were so-so. ��My friends and I eat way too much =/ I was SO EXCITED when they had frog's leap wine but turns out they ran out of bottles. ��Really sad :( �� Anyways, I do plan on going back!"
"i've been there three times and had three disappointing experiences with the service. ��i heard about the famous chicago diner when i lived across the country, so imagine my excitement to finally try it when i moved to chicago. ��i anticipated i'd love it and went there with a great attitude. ��on my first visit, i approached the front door excitedly and was abruptly and rudely told by a sassy little man that there was a wait. ��a wait? ��sure, no problem. ��but the little man stormed off without taking our names or directing us to sit somewhere, etc. ��my friend and i were left taken aback and confused, so we left and found someplace else. ��my next vist -- my first real visit--was for my birthday. ��the food was good--lots of fun, and even my carnivore dad liked his faux meat. ��we sat outside, wh"
"The sushi is average here. Granted that I am not a sushi expert. But for the same price, I've had better rolls and fish. However, the ambiance and decor is good. It's essentially what you're paying for here. I may go back just if some friends really want to go, but definitely not by my own accord."
"Well folks, I was so excited to take my daughter there for the first time to Hopleaf for her 21st birthday and to try out their new kitchen's version of those signature mussels chased w/ icy brews.The dish comes w/ at least a quarter of the mussels either cracked or unopened. The broth/sauce was salty%&%$&^#!!. We sent them back. The second batch w/ Belgian ale was similar. And the fine french fries were GREASY and soggy. What a colossal disappointment. What's a matter Hopleaf?. ."
"Delicious! Can't say enough about it. I had the pulled chicken, and it was to die for. Atmosphere and service were top notch as well."
these burgers are unbelievable. try the hell burger if you like spicy foods they put them on pretzel buns which makes them even better. Interior is cool and they have a outdoor patio. What more can you ask for?
"I have a new religion and its called Sultans Market. The menu is not huge but wow, everything was so amazing. I had the chicken schawerma (sp?) dinner. My friend had the lamb one. It is served on your choice of rice and I chose a mix of the two they offer which I would highly recommend. It was sooo much food for the money. For 3 people the bill was $24 and we ate like kings. We all had a dinner platter of some type. The only thing I wish I would of had was the smoked babaganoush instead of the hummus which was just ok. Also the pita was not as soft as I would have like. I will go back the next time I am in the Wicker Park area. I see they have one in lakeview too which is close to my job."
"I dream of their BLT. In fact, I favor that sandwich over all other sandwiches on the menu. ��Its a double decker with perfect crispy bacon and and and....oh screw this I'm starving and going right now!!"
The best value for your money is the weekend buffet. The food is always delicious and survive superb.
The place looks great ! I went there on a tuesday it was kind of slow the food was just ok :( the service can improve and when you get the bill mmmm you can spend that $$$$ somewhere else a bit disappointed !!!!
"For the price you pay, the environment and quality of the food, I guess it was worth it. I was with a large group, so they had us sitting on wooden bar stools, which is fine at a bar or for a drink before a meal, but with a large group and dinner lasting close to 2 hours it wasn't comfortable at all. ��This place is really nice to go to with friends, but if you are looking for somewhere on the romantic side it was very loud here so I'd go elsewhere. But other than that I think I will be back."
"I have been going to this place for the past year and I absolutely LOVE this place..It never fails me at all with the service, taste and the enviroment.."
I didn't realize how popular this pizza joint was till I finally went in. The pizza is very cheesy and l love the stuffed pizzas! 1 slice and I am full. The breaded mushrooms there are good as well.
"3rd Coast is a great place to start the day off with. ?A full menu that favors the AM taste buds. ?The food is good. ?Ones order is filled quite fast. ?Well prepared with a pleasant presentation. ?Children are welcome. ?Good value for the dollar. ?Recommend early arrival especially for breakfast. ?Mid AM may find yourself with a 5-10 minute wait. ?3 Coasts is for real and the staff works hard to make it a fantastic experience. Note: Stayed at hotel down the street from 3rd Coast. ?Happy to have found 3rd Coast. ?Nicholas P Heille, 3460 Garfield St NE, Minneapolis MN 55418"
"This place is awesome!!!!! We just went there last night for my boyfriend's birthday. I made a reservation on Open Table and to my surprise a variety of times were available to make a reservation. I could write a step by step, detailed review, but it is very simple what this place comes down to. The service (host, busser, waiter, manager) was EXQUISITE! The bread and butter pickles and BBQ chips that welcomed us to our table were outstanding. We ordered the bacon cheddar hush puppies ( I know, right ?! Just typing it sounds naughty) to start. And, yes, they were out of this world. My boyfriend ordered the St.Louis competition ribs with pulled pork and I ordered the flight of BBQ. I truly felt that I should have started a human tunnel for our dinner to be brought to our table because of how"
"This is a review of the management. I went in for an interview and soon realized that it was basically a cattle call. The manager was rude, condescending, and if this is the way he treats prospective employees, I can only imagine how he treats everyone else. I would never eat here and would recommend everyone else not to since this guy was such a jerk."
Ginos original location is the best pizza in town.. awesome flavor in the deep dish. ��Bring a pen to leave your mark on the walls..
One of Chicago best kept secrets! I have been dining there for a long time and I love the food and the service! Its a great place to meet up with the girls and enjoy a nice dinner! They are linked to OpenTable and its just so easy to make a reservation. Love this place!Jenny L.
"Awesome place... Some of the best eggs benedict in the city. ��They treat you well here, and its nice that is is off the beaten path.Deserves 6 stars!"
"Veggie Sandwich was really, really good...and I had a bite of the skirt steak sandwich which was incredible as well. It had sort of an Asian twist to it. Can't wait for the outside to open!"
"The Drinks were awesome and reasonably prices, cozy friendly environment"
"food is outstanding. we've been twice already. first of all the lasagna is among the best I've ever tasted, the porchetta was pretty damn close to divine and the chocolate tortino desert was suspiciously delicious). Very reasonably priced although there are more lavish ways to dine, like everyone getting salads and apps and a full fish along with a $300 bottle of vino. on the other hand we had a great tasting bottle of chianti classico for around $35.the atmosphere. hands down, the best outdoor dining area I've seen in chicago.the service staff were attentive & on point (especially for a rest. that's brand new). everyone in my party had a perfect experience both visits. definitely one of my new favorites."
"This weekend was my first trip to Q. ��It will definitely not ��be my last, as I'm already planning on returning for my birthday next week. �� I am a big fan of BBQ, and in my opinion, this place is one of the best, if not THE best places I've been for it (without doubt here in Chicago). ��The food is incredible. ��From the homemade chips, to the homemade bread/butter pickles (which I'm not a fan of from the jar), to the fantastic st. louis style ribs....place can't be beat. ��They must of spent a TON of money renovating the place to make it look like it does, which is like a nice southern home feel. ��I like the bar area they have out front where you can sit and have a whiskey ��and watch the game while waiting for your table. ��The service and staff were incredibly friendly and the prices were ve"
"I just love the lentils and rice, falafel and the baklava. This place rocks. I'm a meat eater and my daughter is a vegetarian and we both loved what we picked the flavors are delicious and fresh tasting. Plus not expensive."
"Went to Piece last night after visiting a few time for beer and not having been able to get a seat. This place seems to be packed all the time. I've been to Piece after 7PM on Friday and Saturday nights and the wait has always been over an hour, so I never tried the pizza until last night. The atmosphere is pretty disappointing considering what it could be with the cool skylights and vaulted ceiling and rafters. With it's partitioned seating area and cheap looking booths it feels more like a Ponderosa than the hip and fun pizza joint they're trying to be. The place gets very congested and getting a drink at the bar can be a chore. They could make much better use of the space.I've always thought the beer was quite good and figured the pizza must be as well, considering the crowds. But it se"
"A theme restaurant for sure. Once you see the design there is really no good reason to go back as the food is marginal at best, and the service is unprofessional for that price.ZEDZeroEatingDelight451...$ the cost for dinner and drinks for four."
"Boom-baby! ��The legend is true, this is place to go if you want Chicago Deep Dish all others pale in comparison. ��They have a new Chicago Fire Pizza, it was amazing! ��Gets crowded and there is always a wait, but you know what Heinz ketchup says about that. ��Just trying to limit myself to 2x month at this place."
"Delicious food, great wine, need I say more? Service was good, but a little slow. The highlight was definitely the descriptions that you receive with each glass of wine. Who would have thought that a wine that had notes of gloveleather and wet hay would be yummy?The three dinners we had were all tasty and beautifully presented. The cheese flight was also good, but a little smaller than we were expecting, given the price."
This place is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. ��The food is amazing but the service truly is out of this world. Alex is one of the best waiters around and this restaurant is lucky to have him. ��He is very attentive and helpful. ��Augustine and everyone else is great too--they make you feel like home. You must try this place if you have not been yet.
love love love Indie.... great special basil duck. my BF loved his fresh sashimi dinner.. fresh!
"I have been a long time Glenn's patron, even being one of the first ones to discover Glen's. When we first found Glenn's, it was amazing. relatively small amount of customers made a nice atmosphere and the food was very good and unique, something that would make you crave Glenn's because no where else had their style of food. However over the few months its been open it has become immensely popular, and yesterday, we say many people standing around open table, waiting to be seated at 10:00 A.M.. When I asked if we could sit at one of the open tables they said that they those tables are reserved. RESERVED!!! for breakfast. Sorry Glenn but you sold out"
"Delicious local, Metropolis coffee (try a mocha!), fresh (often organic and local) ingredients, gorgeous presentation, friendly staff, locally and family owned... I just can't say enough good things about Nana! I love almost all the food items here. Chef Meikle is a genius. If the Fried Oyster Chowder is on the menu (it's seasonal/rotating), get it. It's amazing!"
Wonderful fondue! Romantic atmosphere! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a fine and fun way to celebrate any special occasion. Such a great ��experience. Make a reservation and be aware it is more expensive than your normal eating joints.
For a local bar/pub it's worth it. ��Food is great and drinks are flowing. ��Really if your looking for more then you shouldn't be going to a pub/bar.
"First off, if you are not a meat-enthusiast, don't go. ��From what I hear the salad-bar is outstanding, but who in their right mind pays $50 to eat a salad-bar? ��It's all about the meat! ��The wait-staff is very attentive, and if you haven't seen your favorite meat in a while, the friendly staff will more than gladly flag down your carniverous desire. ��Side dishes like polenta are replenished before ever running out, the service is great. ��The meat is a high quality, and seems to be cured well. ��I highly suggest the less expensive lunch, same food, less cost. ��Of all the brazilian steakhouses that are springing up all over, this is the cream of the crop."
Best dogs in the city! ��Great service
"What more can you say about culinary genius?Alinea should not, and cannot be rated (but of course I have to allot 6 stars to this masterpiece of a restaurant, although I can only give 5 on yelp).If you don't savor food as an experience as well as sustenance then don't venture to Alinea, because these chefs create for true food connoisseurs. There is nothing else to say..."
"yum. it has been hard for me to find pizza i like in the city. for some reason everywhere I try has a cardboard tasting crust (besides Ian's). Spacca Napoli, why have I not tried you before? Yum, that's all I can say, great crust, stringy cheese, tasty sausage, fresh ingredients. Thank you Spacca Napoli, I knew I could find a place near my apt that was great."
"I made reservations for four, three months ago and glad I did. ?At 7pm, on a Saturdaynight, this place was packed. ?I have problems with my knees and my back so climbing up a tall flight of stairs was the first encounter. ?I was not happy about it, but I did it.So, if you are at any way, shape or form handicapped, ask to remain on the first floor.We first were greeted for drinks which took a while. ?The bbq chips and sweet pickles were a nice touch to start off but don't eat too much of these! ?You will be full before the meal comes.We ordered the hush puppies and the fried green tomatoes, and split the cobb salad. ?Absolutely delicious!My husband ordered the competition ribs and my girlfriend ordered the regular ribs and both appeared to be the same. ?My friend's husband ordered the pork "
"great food, super drinks...will go back"
"Seriously! No really! Come on people we live in one of the best cities in the world for great food and this is what we come up with!? I have lived in the Wonderful City of Chicago for my entire life and have searched for the "" New York Pizza "" for most of it..... I heard about this joint and just had to go....... And all I could say was WOW!!! At 10PM on a Friday night this place was packed! 10 people in line and no parking because they have 6 delivery drivers using their entire lot. As I stood in line and observed I grew hungrier and hungrier and finally..... There it was the Art of Pizza was before me... I tried a piece of stuffed,pan, and thin crust. I could not believe this pizza was what all the rave was about. It made me realize there are a lot of folks out there that have been depri"
"""Hey, what makes this Chicago style pizza? Has it been to jail? Bwa ha ha ha."" (actual joke overheard told by tourist) God, this place is full of tourists, but their stuffed spinach is what keeps me loyal."
"An immediate hit with our whole group, it's certain to become a favorite place to bring visitors to Chicago. ��The food is a deliciously creative American-Romanian blend, the atmosphere is festive (especially on Saturday nights when there is a live band), the drink list is comprehensive (Romanian wine doesn't get enough attention in the States), and did I mention the delicious delicious food?Don't be surprised if Bramko stops by with a free sip of, well, we never did find out what kind of alcohol that was, but it was fun.We looked at the negative reviews here before we went, and they all seem to focus on the aspects that mark authenticity. ��If you're used to European restaurant customs (little longer wait time, lack of fake 'hospitality'), then you'll love the Little Bucharest. ��And even if"
I was in vegetarian heaven.
"I was really hoping this place was going to be great. �� I live very close to it and the hood needs a good place to eat and relax. �� However, its been disappointing so far. �� My first visit was ok. ��I had a great burger and the service was awesome. ��However, the atmosphere of pounding music and all-you-can handle concerts was a bit too much. �� Unfortunatley, today's experience soured me even more. �� I had the wings, which were labeled as some kind of ""sweet chili"" wings, but were more like terriaki and onion wings. ��Very disappointing. ��also, the service sucked. �� Im very disappointed that this neighborhood finally has a bar with decent burgers, and the chance to be a place for refuge from a tough week. �� Instead, we got a burger place (albeit, great burgers) and a place to watch overaged h"
"I was here last weekend with a vegetarian buddy of mine. ��He was concerned there would be nothing for him to eat here. ��Well, turns out all items here are vegetarian until you pay extra for meat ! ��I added lamb sausage to mine and it was awesome. ��It's on a busy street corner (Foster and Clark), but it's pretty quiet inside.Our service was fine and the bill was reasonable. ��Yes i'll be back, but maybe not until my veggie friend comes back to town."
"What can I say about The Hopleaf Bar? Everytime I have been here, I have a great experience. ��I've been coming here for nearly 10 years, and each time is like the first time. ��The atmosphere is great, though it can get loud on the busy weekend nights. ��However, that just adds to the mystique and allure of the place. ��The beer selection is second-to-none. ��They have the largest selection of Belgian beers that I have seen anywhere. ��Looking to drink a Miller Light or Bud? This is NOT the place for that! ��Some of the best beers I have ever had were first sampled at The Hopleaf. ��Megan, the head bartender, is fantastic. She is really ��nice, hospitable, and thoughtful. ��Slim is fantastic as well. ��On my last visit there, I took a very special lady with me. It was her first time there and Megan "
"4.5 Stars!! Gastropub that generally fits any occasion and is somehow, mostly free of tourists (mostly). I've been here with parents for dinner, close friends, co-workers for drinks and downstairs a few times for private parties. Their brunch is phenomenal without being over-the-top. I would recommend the eggs benedict, the mussels vindaloo , fish and chips, Gage Burger and scallops as favorites!"
Great Place! ��The roof top bar is excellent!
Love this place...a very unique atmosphere....better make a reservation if you want a table...I sit a the bar which is usually open...
I love going to this place. ��I enjoy the service and the omlettes are incredibl!
"This place is great. ��The service was impeccable...anything I wanted they were offering to get. ��It is on the pricey side, but I would go back because of the great food and service."
"This place is not worth the hype. Interiors are good. But food is kind of OK-OK type. I liked Fish and Chips but cannot claim to be best in the world. This is yet another food place for me, and nothing remarkable."
I really like eating here and the apps and rolls are very good. �� I've eaten the ones below: Yellowtail Ceviche (yummy) Spicy Trio Roll (very yummy) Rainbow Roll (very yummy) Summer Roll (very very yummy) White Tuna Jalapeno Maki ��(very yummy) Yellowtail Scallion Maki (very very yummy) I like that they don't have a corkage fee. ��What I don't like is to be pressured out of the restaurant. ��I understand that it's busy but I don't like to be pushed out! ��So that's why I did not give 5 stars.Overall the service is pretty decent and the staff are nice.
"I got to give it to the gut who runs this joint, he must be a marketing genius or he just got lucky. I see nothing in this place justifying the popularity and hype and as for Chicago landmark, please! Don't bring more shame to this city as tourists stopping by for the famous dawg are sure never to return here again. Short version is: fries are s...t, dogs are average, rest is questionable at best. BIG fan of FD&C Green No. 3 and Blue No. 2 (?), than you will love the relish. Do you die for crappy fries dip fried past the point of recognition by taste (?) than Superdawg is your place. Like a good dog? Do yourself a favor, go to Jewel and get some Oscar Mayer dogs, some buns and than you see the difference. Sorry for the bad review, can't help being honest.SD."
"First time having a Chicago style hot dog was at Hot Doug's & it didn't disappoint. Saw the restaurant featured on Anthony Bourdain's show, No Reservations, but can't say we were as eager to try the out of the box dogs. We stuck with the standard & concluded Chicago has better hot dogs than LA. We were greeted by Doug, but didn't find him as friendly as others seem to. Also didn't like the fact that you can't take a seat till you've placed your order; noticed it wasn't very conducive to a family in line. We will return when back in town."
"This place is supposed to serve one of the top hotdogs in the U.S. so I went with an open mind, figuring they may be overhyped. ��All I have to say is..This is it huh? For $5 (really, why so much?) my Vienna Chicago style dog was squished into an undersized shoebox, covered with luke warm crinkle fries, and the whole thing looked like it had seen better days. What's with the weird green tomato at one end of the hotdog? Is this a joke? ��The ingredients of a Chicago style dog are supposed to be arranged so you get an equal amount of all the ingredients in each bite. ��This was a sorry excuse for a Chicago dog as far as presentation. ��Taste was OK, but again not any different than dozens of other Vienna stands. ��The Superburger was almost $6 and was equal to, if not worse quality, than a Wendy'"
It is one of the best bakery in town..I simply love the mango mousse cake!! A must go for everyone
"I was skeptical about Sprout - I'm a huge Top Chef fan, but I don't believe TV fame necessarily means real talent. Glad to say, I was proven 100% wrong. The food was creative, beautifully presented, and most importantly absolutely delicious. Not a single dish disappointed. Highlights were the octopus and fois gras apetizers, and the short rib main course was sick (in a good way). Another pleasant surprise: the service was impeccable, our server was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, super friendly and his recommendations were spot on. Quite unexpected for a restaurant that hasn't been open that long. Would definitely recommend and will be going back very soon! $60 for 3 course plus couple of freeby small courses. Wine extra."
Great place for people needing gluten-free options. ��Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. ��Nice ambiance as well. ��Only downside is when they seat you really close to other couples and you hear all conversations. ��Still worth it.
"So I was sick a couple of days ago and decided that I wanted soup. And what's better than some Pho? Chicken Noodle Soup (american) is officially KICKED TO THE CURB. Basically most of ALL my friends order Pho when they're sick now.I of course had to order the Beef Pho. Plus an order of Shrimp Spring Rolls. DELICIOUSSSS. I love how everything comes on the side; the fresh bean sprouts, cilantro, basil, and lime. Who could forget the Peanut/Plum Sauce that comes with the rolls or the dark sauce and hot sauce that comes with the soup. I like mine with extra hot sauce. Just talking about it is making me want some Pho.So because I was pretty sick, I did order delivery for the first time. The owner was so sweet! Knowing that I was sick, he sent me Hot Tea. He promised it would make me feel better "
"It isn't the easiest restaurant to get a reservation for, but it is worth the effort! Unbelievable meats of all varieties, brought to your table in endless quantities. This place is number one on my list of restaurants to revisit when in Chicago."
"Not as crazy about the crust however is a staple of Chicago. Great place to take visitors for a deep dish, downtown craziness, and authentic Chicago feel."
"Food has been ok for years, but can become the same after a while.Omelets hear are dissapointing, basically scrambled eggs folded in two with ingredients in middle..I much prefer Meli Cafe in greektown for my omeletes and pancakes."
"How can you not have gone here yet! Stop reading the reviews and get out! Mmmmmm, mmeat!"
Great service. Great ambiance. Will come back for sure!
"I had the pleasure of eating here a few months ago when I passed through Chicago. The next time I'm in town I'll be stopping here again. Everything my friends and I tried was seriously tasty but I'd have trouble ordering anything other than the pork belly and cod dish. Scrumptious. The apple cider donuts for desert were as delicious as I expected. The service was excellent. Our waitress was cool and knowledgeable, and especially helpful with the wine pairings. This place had everything I need in a meal, great food, great service and a reasonable price."
"went last weekend for the first time and had a very nice experience. ��I was initially overwhelmed by the wine selections, but my server (can't remember her name) was very helpful. ��Stayed and had dinner. ��I had the trout with an almond/pepper jelly and my partner had a pastrami sausauge. ��Both were outstanding. ��Keep up the good work"
"We called ahead to make a reservation for a party of 4 at 7:00PM on a Tuesday, and the host informed us that they only have 6:00 or 8:00 available. We took the ""offer"" and arrived on time, by the time we started our dinner it was around 6:30, and there were still a ton of open table around us. Why being so pretentious? I hate restaurants doing that, even though it's your ""marketing strategy"". Service is definitely good because there are actually more people working than the number of customers, so service was impeccable. When it comes to the food, I think it was just OK. The manager was nice enough to offer us a couple complimentary appetizers including the unagi watermelon and the baby spring rolls. The unagi watermelon was such an odd combination, the unagi was totally over cooked, not a"
Worst service ever. Food is good but they run out of food and staff has no idea what they are doing
"Simply said, not impressed. I guess I was expecting Los Angeles quality tacos and was led down. The prices were ok, but not cheap. I guess I will keep looking for that special taco place that reminds me of home."
BEST WINE bar in the city! seriously!
"Went here for lunch with my aunt. I was not impressed with the food at all. ��The chicken sandwich was very basic, the fries were cold! ��The service was just ok - even though it was not really busy, we had to wait ��10 minutes for a waiter! ��Also was surprised to find that valet parking was required for lunch! ��I was truly disappointed and will not be returning any time soon."
"Best dogs ever! ��Keep in mind it is cash only. ��My wife and I didn't realize this until it was time to pay, and Doug ( nicest man ever that takes your order) let us eat, and then run to the ATM to pay. ��Sweet as apple pie. I had the corn dog and the gator, and my wife tried the blue cheese and pear sausage as well as the foie gras ( you have to try, right??!!!!) ��They were all delicious. ��A friend told us you can even bring you own beer, which was well needed to digest. ��The line wasn't too bad as other complained. ��My wife and I scarfed everything down! ��I recommend you try at least two dogs a person!"
"Zed 451 Is a really unique spot to visit! I'd never been to a restaurant like this except for a Brazilian steakhouse. First off, my favorite thing about the restaurant is the service. Our server was Garren, this really friendly guy with a good sense of humor. He knew the menu from all sides and could answer all my questions without needing to ask. All the chefs that come out bearing various meat offerings once you lay your stone out were ��also friendly, knowledgable, and a diverse kitchen staff. (all ages, ethnicities, etc). They also taught us proper etiquette for taking the meats from the Kebaps or plates. (which in case you are wondering , the tongs are only used to grab the red meats).The harvest bar was an interesting appetizer bar with soups, breads, small salads, meats and cheeses, "
Awsome!
"My favorite sushi restaurant EVER! My girlfriends and I come here often and always have a blast! The food is amazing and service is great! Love that we can bring our own wine... We always get a variety of appetizers to split between us and have SO much fun! Must-haves: angry salmon, sesame crusted scallops, tropical ceviche, hamachi carpacio!!!! We usually car pool and then do valet, which is great for the price and convenience. I'm pregant now and am craving sushi from COAST every day!"
"While my vegetarian wife didn't like it, but I loved it. ��I especially liked all the veggies they brought out in the beginning. �� A cornucopia of flavors. ��Seemed very authentic. ��I want to bring my boys back for some bbq"
"Very good food. Burger are way better than anything out there. Pretzel buns are very tasty. I like to keep it simple, bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg on top..mmmmm tasty. Might just have to order it today."
I did not enjoy my pube infused buttersquash soup.
"I ate here on the weekend and had the greatest time. ��When I walked in I was pissed about the 45 minute wait for two people, but now that I have experienced the place I will book my table in advance!The food was delectable. ��The special ciopino was very tasty. ��My date had the duck, a recommendation from our amazing server, and she was more than pleased. ��I have to thank our server, Josiah, for talking her into the duck because it earned me some points on our first date! ��Not only did he explain the dishes for us in a great way, but he kept us entertained even though I could tell he was really busy. ��I thought he was hilarious but also really knowledgeable about the restaurant and definitely convinced us to come again. �� I don't know why everyone is complaining about the service---I though"
"I visited Mia Francesca and i thought it was fabulous. ��The food was excellent, the server was almost perfect (she was helpful and attentive but not bothersome). ��The location, I thought would be distracting, but the street and traffic was invisible as I ate with my family. ��I am trying to figure out what would have improved the experience or restaurant, but I really can't think of anything. ��I'd give a 4.5 but Yelp doesn't allow it. Great restaurant - definitely one that we'll be returning to."
BEST PIZZA IN THE WORLD. Two story location with bars and bathrooms on each floor. Great times.
i love everything
"I love Sabatino's!! I live in the neighborhood and appreciate the Old School Charm along with wonderful food and great service! Donna,Enzo andthe restofthe gang always make me feel welcome! Food is always fabulous ..."
"The best fish in all of Chicago... short and sweet.What I like? ��Check out the followingHoney roll, Lava roll, Spicy Tako, Spicy Scallop... yum, yumI've been coming here for a number of years and have eaten all over the city. ��This place still has the best sushi out there. ��Not quite the see and be seen place, so if you're looking for that look elsewhere. ��But if you're looking for a chill, loungy place to eat with friends, and BYOB... this is your place.The cat's out of the bag though, so check it out on a weeknight cuz they don't take reservations. ��I guarantee you won't be disappointed.Jay"
The service was superb. The food was outstanding. Yolk offers a fabulous kids menu. (Long line if you get there after 9 a.m.)
"The food was really good, every bite from start to finish was hot and tasty. We had dinner reservations and I totally recommend them. The service was great and friendly, not extremely fast, but we were not in a hurry so it was perfect. this was our first time here, I had the pumpkin ravioli and my husband had the seafood pasta, both delicious."
"Disappointed and Disgusted with Texas de Brazil in Chicago. Last week I visited Chicago for the first time and Texas de Brazil was one restaurant my husband and I wanted to have dinner at this exquisite restaurant. However, to our deception before even having a chance to enter through the main doors a gentleman (putting it nicely) standing by the door immediately blocked the entrance and refused to let us in the restaurant. This door person stopped us from entering and asked if we had reservations and of course being our first time in Chicago, we replied Do we need reservations to dine here? and the door person did not respond. He also gave us his fixed price menu and continued staring at us from head to toes. I know racial profiling law in Arizona is trying to be enforced by law makers; h"
DO NOT ...AND I WILL STRESS THIS DO NOT EAT HERE! This place is waaay over rated! The food is simply not that great...i've had better! Not to mention that the place is super dirty (dirty silverware) and their service is not that great...Ive been there a few times and everytime ive ate there i felt like i was being rushed. Don't waste your time here!
"Simply It was truly a great dining experience. ��They're a BYOB, so the eating there is always fun. ��The staff is amazingly friendly and the owner is very passionate about the restaurant and it shows. ��The food is always fresh and delicious and I've never been disappointed with my meal. ��The takeout is an equally pleasant experience. ��I got there a couple of minutes early to get my food and they gave me a glass of water and a free watermelon smoothie (which was amazing) to help me pass the time. ��I am a loyal customer and will continue to be."
ahhh....a dream come true in a meal!!
"Best Ethiopian food I have had in Chicago. ��Ive been to Ras Dashen and Ethiopian Diamond and neither were as flavorful as Demera. ��Ras Dashen had some nice vegan/vegetarian options but their food was bland. ��Ethiopian Diamond was a little on the bland side as well. ��The mystery to me was that both Ras Dashen and Ethiopian Diamond had more customers and Ethiopian Diamond was packed. ��Go figure. ��That saying a line out the door means the food is good in the kitchen doesn't apply as much in this case. ��If you want flavor, go to Demera. ��The manager was also really nice. ��However, be careful when parking on the streets. ��I got a ticket for parking in a taxi cab stand and honestly never saw the sign."
"If I could give 10 stars I would! ��This is by far the BEST Mexican restaurant in the city. ��We have searched for a great Mexican restaurant on the northside for over a year and we have finally found one! ��Their combo plates are amazing, the margaritas are perfect."
"Place is pretty good so far... but it should rock a little harder for it's opening week. ��Possibly just opening week jitters.Love the way it looks.. large windows.. really high ceilings.. almost too high. ��If this place wasn't as busy as it was, I would have felt like I was dining at the McCormick. ��food is decent.. nothing really to speak out of. ��Oh- The diver scallops were great.The downside: everything is so overpriced. ��That's what is to be expected on Michigan Ave. I guess.It is a nice place to be taken."
"WORST SERVICE EVER!It took forever to have our order taken. ��There were three tables seated and two waitress so I'm not sure what the hold-up was. ��Took forever to get our food. ��The food was good so I was ready to overlook the service. ��It just got worse from there. ��Our waitress disappeared and never returned. ��After waiting for almost 20 minutes with dirty plates in front of us, I asked another waitress for water, to-go boxes and coffee. ��They had to make more coffee which took 15 minutes. ��I had to keep flagging the other waitress and owner down. ��We ordered the white chocolate cream and berries. ��What we got was one strawberry, pears, oranges, and mangoes. ��Those fruits do not go well with chocolate, but of course no one was around to complain to. ��I asked for the check and 15 minutes"
"This was our first experience with Ethiopian food and what an amazing experience it was. The service was very friendly and fast for a Friday night, especially since every table was taken. The food was just amazing. Perfectly spiced with lots of flavor. We would recommend this restaurant to anyone and we sure will try to get back there,"
Last week was in Chicago for 6 days due to a trade show and every night the dinners were at different steakhouses. ��Mastro's was by far the best. ��The food and service was great. ��If you have a chance to go I would.
I took my employees (meat cutters) there for dinner for our annual holiday party. The meat was outstanding . The service was second to none. You won't be dissappointed for all 70 of us weren't. ��Remember were all butchers and we know whats good.
"Absolutely amazing! this place gives fine dining a fresh new twist! You get all the amazing taste and flavors you expect from a gourmet restaurant, and none of the stuffiness! The perfect place to take a date without breaking the bank! I had foodgasms!"
"I had the opportunity to try this place out with some friends and family on a recent rainy Friday night. Upon arrival, we were told that there was a 2 hour and 45 minute wait. We ended up waiting about 50 minutes to get a table which wasn't all to bad considering the wait time that we were quoted. I had high hopes for this place after seeing all the good press it was receiving. I would rate the entire experience a 6 out of a 10. The pizza was a little dissapointing.. it was kind of bland. The best dish that we tried was the giant spinach Ravioli it was so good I could of eaten 5 more orders by myself. The pork belly with the apple mostarda was killer also. Overall, I would go back here again but I still prefer their sister restaurant the Purple Pig over this one."
"This review boils down to a couple of low points that unfortunately took away from what could have been a really nice dinner out. ?1) Hostess and Seating: We were a party of two with a reservation and yet had to wait a half an hour for our table. ?Once it was time to seat us, the hostess came out to the pool table in the Blackstone (that was nice) and said our table was ready....but, then it wasn't again... a very oops, just kidding moment, followed by some sort-of-awkward standing around in front of the hostess booth time. ?In a nice restaurant--as suggested by the prices, the celeb chef and the buzz --hostesses (once upon a time, I used to be one) should seat people who have reservations promptly, or quote an appropriate time that they will have to wait, do all of this while being accomm"
I love this place. ��The menu is great. ��The service is great. ��The prices are appropriate. ��It has a delightful environment. ��Perfect for a quick meal or to go. ��It is perfect for my lifestyle.
"I'm no expert, but I think you'd be hard pressed to find a hotdog joint as good as Hot Doug's.The flavor combinations are inspired and like nothing I've tasted before. I had the Irish Banger with Dark Beer Mustard and Horseradish Cheddar Cheese and my friend had the Red Wine and Demi-Glace Venison Sausage with Fig Goat's Butter and Raclette CheeseBoth were mouth-wateringly delicious, especially as we were so hungry from waiting over 2 hours (that's right - 2 hours - but so worth it). I personally preffered mine, but only by a fraction because I found the sauce on the Venison hotdog a little sweet. The venison itself was delicious, as was the raclette cheese.The Irish banger was also good, and the mustard was the perfect spiceyness with just the right amount of beer flavour. The rich chedda"
"Awesome, awesome, awesome..and crowded. Food is meant for sharing and small portions keep the calories under control. All of it excellent, tasty and wine to die for. Service was attentive but not overbearing. When we moved inside to keep the party going at the bar, service was down a notch, but they were packed. Get there, worth it!"
"First brunch at Milk & Honey this Sunday, finally braved the line and was happy we did. Huevos Rancheros in a casserole was divine, oatmeal pancakes with blueberries and peaches sublime and delicious iced green tea. The thing that impressed was the consistency of the food coming out of a busy Sunday brunch kitchen; every dish looked the same. High quality is only as good as the consistency, and Milk and Honey must be taking good care of their kitchen staff because you need happy employees to put out high volume, high quality, consistent dishes that look beautiful and taste great."
I'm drooling just thinking about this place. I went there for a later lunch and there was no line. ��I did seem to order way to much food! The tortas are larger than i expected. The hot chocolate and Churros are a must for dessert!
"I love Yelp but I've always been a lurker. Carnivale made me come out of the shadows and create an account. I have never had as bad an experience as I've had here.Its so weird that I got to experience all the bad yelp reviews in one night, lucky me!1. Bartenders who ignore you. We've been standing and trying to get the attention of this older bartender but got no response. Saw the asian looking one who was recommended by another yelper but he was very busy (maybe getting all ignored people's drinks) and was on the far side so went to the lady instead. It took maybe another 5 minutes before she acknowledged our presence. Got our drinks 10 minutes after that 1st nod. We know you guys are busy but just give us a sign that you see us and we'll feel better waiting! 2. Reservation process. When "
"This place is amazing. The staff is incredibly knowledgable, the ambience is great, wine menu is riduclous...For appetizers ��we had the chick pea fries with fresh grated parmasean and white bean stew with boar sausage. HOLY &*%$!!! For my entree, I had the beef tenderloin with black truffle reduction, roasted asparagus and potatoes. My girlfriend had wood roasted lemon chicken over spinach. For desert we shared a chocolate and hazelnut souffle, with hazelnut gelato and candied hazelnuts. oh my god. May have been the best meal I have ever had at a restaurant. I have already recommended it to everyone in my contact list via text message. If you're considering going there, stop considering and just go. Impossible that you'll be disappointed."
"Well, it certainly is upscale bbq--if you're talking about the room and location.....and the prices!. ��Beyond the veneer of fine dining, there's not a lot to recommend this place. ��The food is no match for Lem's or Honey 1, and neither are the Gold Coast/tourist prices. ��Twelve dollars for a pulled pork sandwich? ��C'mon.The ��wine list was an uninspiring collection of corporate supermarket standards with a couple of overpriced cliches (Veuve and Dom anyone?) thrown in from the local mega-wholesaler. ��Sadly for a bbq restaurant, the beer list was even worse and comprised mostly of Miller and Bud products with Heineken and Corona passing for interesting imports."
"Food, Service, atmosphere. ��Plenty of options, 1st class service and great ambiance. ��Everything we ordered was about a 8.5/10."
Love this place! Great food and lively atmosphere. Little on the pricey side but portions are huge and wine pour very generous. All bartenders are very friendly...my favorite Justin and Dan make me feel always welcome.
"I have never written a review before and signed up just to write this one. The service here was TERRIBLE. I have never experienced such horrible service in my life. The staff was also rude.Here's what happened: We showed up at 6:30 last night (a Thursday!), and the restaurant was packed. No worries, we expected that. The hostess told us that our party of four would be seated within a half hour, so we found a place at the bar and each had a glass of wine. A half hour rolls by, and I always get nervous about these things, so I went back up to the hostess and pointed out my boyfriend (who is very tall and noticeable) and said, that is Dave, who the reservation is under, we are standing at the bar right there, so that you can find us. She says, Great! You are next. So I settle back in at the b"
"Yolk used to be good, maybe about two years ago when I first visited. ��Now it is just way too much of a crowded s**t show to even bother with it. ��If you feel like you need to visit, go only on a weekday--or very early on the weekends. ��If you do not, you will wait probably at least 40 minutes for a table which is way too long to wait for breakfast. ��There are other reasons to stay in and cook breakfast/go to Pilsen for Huevos Rancheros as well:First off, their coffee sucks. ��For a breakfast/brunch place, this is inexcusable. ��Secondly, it's expensive--I think they recently rolled out a new menu with higher prices, naturally. ��Thirdly the service is really spotty. ��Sometimes it's great, other times it's non-existent. ��I've actually walked out after being seated when no server even bothered"
"Funny, when I thought someone was looking for the perfect martini, the first place to come to mind was Wildfire. ��Then I look at the reviews and I see others agree with me. ��I love the Lemon Drop Martini.......and their food is great, too!!!!"
"A little overpriced, but good neighborhood joint. Favorite pizzas: goat cheese, tomato, basil and regular with anchovies and artichoke hearts."
"I could not believe how perfect an experience we had at Carnivale -- just go there and try it. You will walk out elated.My husband & I went in November for a birthday dinner and immediately were pleased. The place is huge and decorated in bright colors, huge murals, and the exposed brick and concrete surprisingly adds to the warmth instead of adding a colder aspect. We dressed up (casual chic, I suppose) but were glad to feel a more casual atmosphere than expected. Nothing about Carnivale is pretentious or fancy, but it's definitely sophisticated.We had a cheese, honey, & cracker appetizer that boasted locally grown ingredients and was so flavorful we just ate wide-eyed while contemplating our next move. For the entrees, my husband had a rich gnocchi in a decadent sauce - not a huge servin"
"You would not think this place would be veggie friendly but the staff is very aware of what is in its foods. ��I frequently order the avocado burrito suizo, with verde sauce instead of red. �� The avocado burrito is stuffed so heavily with avocados, it would make any avocado lover cry with delight. ��They are always busy, and sometimes it gets a little slow on service, but worth trip for food. ��Just leave your expectations of super fast service at home. ��:)"
"Loved it! ��I went on a Friday at 6ish with a group of 8, we got a big booth to ourselves and had an excellent time. ��Decor-wise, I dug the big curtains and the tall chairs. ��Normally, $12 for a drink is excessive for my taste, but it was definitely worth it! ��Quality ingredients, strong, and delicious all around. ��Our server was very nice and had great recommendations."
"This place is OK. Nothing that special, and the prices are pretty steep. I guess I should try it again."
"All I can say is WOW! This place is amazing it really hold true to its name CARNIVALE! ��I recommend you take out of town guests here or business associates that you want to make an impression on. From the color splashed on every wall and ceiling to the wonderful bubbly service to the mouth watering food. This place is a definite stop and eat in! Make sure to make a reservation because it is packed any day of the week. I recommend the Guacamole, Meat and Cheese of Spain, Halibut, and as side orders you must get the fried sweet plantains, fried yuca with garlic mojo, braised greens with smoked bacon and the mac and cheese which is to die for and the flavors of each dish can not be matched by any other restaurant. This restaurant has it all and more. It is impressive on so many levels and def"
Suck Fest!
I love this place!! ��Chips and salsa amazing!! ��Food amazing1 ��Most of all the service is so damn nice! ��The servers are so nice and just want to give them $100 tips because they are so nice. ��In fact they shake your hand when you leave and can remember where you sit the times before. ��Awesome
you want to experiment with ethnic food? Go here. Dont go anywhere else. Never mind what other people say. they dont know. I know. I have been to every persian restaurant in the states worth mentioning. And i am persian. EVERYTHING is good here. I suggest the barg kabob or joojeh. Get dill rice. I don't know why everybody raves about other places rice being good. Indian and Asian rice is not good. Persian rice is rice. Everything else tastes like some kind of bile that was extracted from a pigeons cadaver. Finish off with the Bamieh and some Tea. Dont bother with anything else. Im telling you.
"I used to be a big fan of this restaraunt, but the last few times I have gone have left me a bit down. ��The steaks are lacking in quality and the food doesn't seem to be warm enough when it is delivered to our table. ��This bumbs me out because I really used to enjoy bringing my dates to this place."
Great Greek food & desserts. Love the place
"Everything I ordered for carryout lacked flavor. We had to add salt once we began to eat. The food was just ok, nothing to brag about.I will not recommend or visit a second time. By the way the people at the carryout all looked angry and with no desire to be working. I wondered how their bosses treat them."
"This is hands down my favorite breakfast place in the city. ��It's pricey but totally worth it!I love how they tweak their dishes to give traditional recipes an edge .The nuski (not sure if this is the correct spelling) bacon is so great I order it every time I go along with a soy mocha, which is delicious as well.I highly suggest you try it if you are in the area!"
"Very classy place with wonderful service and excellent food. My party arrived early and was seated right away. Our server Brandon was one of the best. Very attentive and very educated about the menu and the wines offered. We took up the table for three hours on a busy Friday night but never felt rushed. We ordered mussels for an app and they were very tasty. ��Not rubbery at all. Dinner included prime rib, kc steak and a variety of sides. The prime rib was some of the best I have ever had. Many options on the well thought out menu, the service and the overall ambience is why I list kinzie chop house as a five star. I also love gibsons but this place gives them a run for their money. Bravo!"
"Children less than 10 banned for brunch, parents beware."
the best meal I've had all year. Great atmosphere and food is just out of this world. Service is excellent.
"I ordered the Kobe sliced brisket and was somewhat disapointed. The brisket really lacked the smokey taste of open pit BBQ. ��It was also somewhat dry. ��I'm somewhat of a brisket snob having lived in Texas for 3 years. ��In Texas you can get better brisket at a gas station (Rudy's). ��This place isn't even in the same league as the Salt Lick.The sides are average, about what you would expect. I thought the service was great contrary to other reviews."
"Slightly above average upscale tavern fare in a relaxed, unpretentious environment. Big menu with few disappointments, but nothing blows you out of the water. Generous portions and modest prices make it a good go-to spot."
"I went on the suggestion from a friend and I'm in LOVE. ��The food is so delicious. ��The shakes, you really can't tell they are non-dairy. ��I ate so much I thought I was going to burst in a great way. ��No matter what you eating beliefs, the food is so good, you will be back. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
Best thin crust pizza in Chicago. ��Period.
Every time I go to Chicago I stop here! I love it super yummy and quick!
been to many brazzaz and this one never disappoints me! i would definitely go back again!
"Cozy atmosphere, attentive staff (just a touch slow at first), vast menu, and great food. Some dishes were clearly better than others.The owners are very affable and welcoming. Dishes are delicious and portions are more than plenty.I would buy the artwork on the walls if the owner would sell it. Atmosphere was a pleasant surprise; the place is actually slightly romantic when the lights dim around 8 pm.I will be back. PS Pho is authentic and killer (reconciling it with my trip to Vietnam)."
Found out The Bad Apple was voted Best Burger last year by Metromix... so we thought we'd see if they were up to their title! We loved it! Nice crowd and little wait to get seated. Our waitress knew every single beer on the menu... and there are hundreds (impressive). The drink/beer list blew our minds! Such a wide variety- they get an A+! The cheese curds are dynamyte and the homemade dressings/sauces/ketchups are great (don't listen to the reviews about the ketchup- people just like to complain when things are different from the norm). The Elvis burger rocks! Another kudo's to the artwork in the place as well- super cool. Only negatives are the cheese on the burgers is nill- make a bigger slice please! And the bathrooms suck (one bathroom for her/him) tell your current hostess to take a 
"I'll start with the good: food was absolutely delicious. I had Aracherra and the mac & cheese. Drinks were tasty as well. I also enjoyed the high energy with all the vibrant colors...so ambiance and food get a 5/5.Now onto the bad...ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE I have ever had at a restaurant. ?If you go for dinner at Carnivale, I do NOT recommend Andrea the waitress. ?Upon being seated, she took a very long time to order our drinks and serve them. ?Once served drinks, she took a while to come back and check on us, see if we'd like to order, etc. I ordered guac and chips for the table (it was a party of 8 for my birthday), and asked to order our meals with it (because we noticed service is very slow). ?She followed that by saying 'can you hold on one second?, turned around to a couple who arrive"
"This is a wonderful restaurant. ��The atmosphere is great and the servers very nice. ��Unfortunately the food can be hit and miss. ��Once I had a steak for brunch that was over done and very bland. ��The other few times I have gone the food was much better, but this certainly is not a place for healthy eating. ��Lots of comfort food. ��I would recommend everyone try this place."
"I like that they provide so many choices. As a vegan, I haven't found many other places that provide a safe haven of wonderful offerings. They are busy all of the time, I can only imagine how much work it must be to create all of the food in such a tiny little place. The days of beans and barley are a thing of the past. I know they have been around for a long time, and their age is starting to show.A bit of advice: If the diner folks want to stay current they need to start thinking about sustainability, local and eco-green. The building looks a little run down, and exactly how green is it? Do they use organics?Local? Is it a good organization or just a front for a wealthy dude to make $$ off of us trusting vegans? Just asking Diner Man, we see your Jag parked in front with the vegdiner pla"
"Love Love Love Chicago Q! Chicago Q is a fairly new restaurant in the area and is a great addition to the Gold Coast. ��I Love the atmosphere. This restaurant is open till 2:00am on the weekends. I have eaten there at 1:00am, and I have eaten there at 4pm, it doesn't matter what time it is. Its perfect for any occasion at any hour. Chicago q always satisfies my BBQ cravings! ��I cannot get enough of this restaurant. After old town fest on Sunday we decided to go to Chicago q for dinner . We walked in with a group of six without making reservations. The restaurant was pretty busy, but the staff was extremely accommodating and quickly pushed two tables together near the TV so the guys could watch the game. Their service ��was outstanding. As soon as we were seated the waiters brought over the c"
"I can't wait writing this review. I just got back home after spending the 4th of July weekend at Chicago for the annual Ethiopian soccer tournament. Since I am from the DC area which is a 'home away from home' with the largest Ethiopian population in North America, I can confidently say I am in the best position to rate Demera. I visited Ethiopian Diamond for dinner a day before having lunch at Demera. In my opinion Demera is by far better than Ethiopian Diamond in terms of taste, food freshness, and service. It is really worth waiting to get a fresh order made food than eating an already cooked one like the one we had at Ethiopian Diamond."
Hot bartenders......Yes.Good Food.....no......too pretentious.I will be back for the eye candy......
Great food. Great service. ��Check it out if you like authentic Mexican.
"Wow is all I can say. My roommate and I came in for dinner on a Monday night and were treated to their family style dinner night. You pick 2 appetizers, 2 soups/salads, 3 entrees and a dessert. The apps arrived before we even placed our order with the server, we were thinking it was an error but when he arrived back with the wine he assured us it was correct. Not sure how they did that but it was fast and the avocado crostini was fabulous, as was the bruschetta. The caprese salad and butternut squash soup were also amazing and the portion sizes were just right. Not too much , just enough to satiate you and get you prepped for the next course. Our three entrees were caprese pasta, rigatoni bolognese and spaghetti with meatballs and sausage. The pasta was definitely made on site, fresh and t"
Crisp is delish! The wings are massive and amazing and the budda bowls are yummy! I've never had a burrito so I can't comment. The restaurant is BYOB which is great. Parking is street parking on busy Broadway so that can be tricky. Seating for groups can be difficult if going during peak hours of lunch or dinner - picnic table style. It's not fancy but it's great food!
"This is a beautiful restaurant. ��The ambiance, the music, and the food. ��Sometimes I have had a good server and sometimes I have had a server that only depends on the people that carry around the different meats. ��This place will have you overeating, cuz the quality of food is there, and they also have a huge buffet that comes with the dinner. ��YOu are definitely paying good money to eat here, but you definitely will not leave this place with an empty stomach. ��I have been there 3 times and I am sure I will be back again."
"those not really good !!!last week , i went there with my friendsthey told me the duck it's the one i should i try !!but that was totally different !!!!!!!the duck it was not crispy ,, after they peel the duck's skin , how they can get the rice in a few minutes ???? and the fried rice it was coolwhen they gave it to us , and made me thirsty ...And the broccoli kind of stale,,,~~ .. sucksi wont go there anymore !!!"
"The good:First, this is a good bar, with an excellent and fair-priced whiskey selection and a decent assortment of not-often-seen beers on draft. Second, all members of the staff, from the door guy to the servers are friendly and helpful. Third, the attention to detail, from the bathrooms to the candle holders is superb. Fourth, the kitchen is open very late - a surprising rarity in Chicago, and the music is played at a reasonable volume.The bad:A restaurant in Logan Square that very few L.S. residents can afford to eat at? I'm willing to pay for good ingredients, and it's fine to have expensive items on the menu, but why not take Lula's cue and offer a sub-$10 sandwich or soup? You really want me to pay $15 for a very small portion of cauliflower and lentils? I'm very protective of our ne"
"Sadly I was not impressed. ��I had a single 14 inch pizza delivered to my apartment on a Saturday night. ��When I placed my order I was told it would take 45 minutes to arrive. ��I thought that was a bit ambitious, so I waited 90 minutes before calling to check the status of my order. ��I was told, rather rudely, that my pizza was still in route and would arrive ""soon."" ��Soon turned out to be two hours after I placed my order and COLD. ��Honestly, if I wanted to heat up a pizza in the oven I would have simply bought one at the grocery store. ��Decent pizza, but not worth the trouble."
"I haven't been here in years, and by years I mean about 5. ��However, my job used to order a LOT of pizzas from here for inventory, and everyone made sure to hang around just so we could load up on pizza before leaving. ��My mom's been coming back here lately because it's cheap and filling and tonight I decided what the heck, I had no patience to cook, why not? ��Their dinners come with so much food, I don't know how you couldn't be full after. ��Any slice of pizza is $2.95 (which I still think is a good deal) and I swear, EVERY time I've ever gone in, the same guy is there! ��Plus, he's friendly. ��While waiting for my food a massive crowd came out of nowhere and up until the time I got my food (about 25 minutes later), there was a line that would seem to diminish and right before it did, a swa"
This place is a joke. ��The food is disgusting and the dust alone on the wine bottles is enough to make you throw up. ��I left reeking of fishy oil that never came out of my clothes. ��Our African American server stunk of booze and it was only 9pm. ��His breath was a liquor cabinet. ��I was shocked. ��I wanted to remind him that he was playing with fire and to perhaps think before he drinks ON THE JOB!! ��The one decent thing is the chocolate. ��I would never come back but if I did ha this is the only thing on the entire menu worth a sinlge dollar. ��This place is a joke. ��SAVE YOUR MONEY!!
By far one of the best restuarants in the city! The king crab and oysters are my favorite; they also have a fabulous Seafood salad that is great at lunch... You should always sit in the Blue Crab Lounge area -- it has a great vibe and live music many nights a week. Ask for Eric to be your server!
"good dawg, and I had a burger ooo so good."
"I finally ate dinner at Big Jones after seeing them on 190 North. I've been meaning to eat here a long time. It was a late birthday dinner with two of my friends. We had the southern table dinner, which was supposed to be three courses for 25 dollars but it was more like four courses with cornbread and other interesting things to eat. I had the scallops, and my friends both had pasta, and everything was great, and a really good bargain.Next we're going to try their brunch. If it's as good as their dinner, it will be a welcome find."
"This place is GROSS.I talked to my server and she said that they don't even make their pizzas there! ��They get their dough frozen from some secret Giodannos factory and they thaw it and then bake it. ��When have you had great frozen food? ��Sorry to burst the legend bubble, but this place is definitely NOT THE REAL DEAL!"
"Went to Superdawg for the first time and I was slightly disappointed. It wasn't bad, but it did not live up to the hype. The food is pretty good but not great. I personally don't see what the big deal is about having my food brought to my car. ��The lot is tiny, jam-packed, and nearly impossible to navigate, even in my compact car. It's located at a big busy 3-way angle intersection, making it difficult to access from most directions. You have to ask someone from the kitchen to let you into a door in the rear of the building by the garbage in order to use the bathroom. The prices are a little high but not terrible. Overall, it's decent, just not worth all the hype. Visit if you're in the area but don't go much out of your way for it."
"I love this restaurant! They have the most amazing chicken pho and yummy spring rolls. I love the mix of people and the family run vibe. Be willing to wait outside for the table on the weekends, this place gets packed out the door. Well worth the wait and I always leave feeling full and happy."
The Buffalo Chicken Rolls are the best! ��They truely are so amazing if you like the hot sauce flavor. ��The blue cheese dressing served with them is also delicious.
"I brought my brother here for dinner a couple of weeks ago and we were both pleased with our meals. ��I like to try very different interesting foods so I went with the bone marrow and my brother had the pork belly special. ��I have never had bone marrow before and I loved it!!! ��My brother ate all his pork belly so I think he liked it too, lol. ��This is a great place for drinks or a fun dinner out with a friend, significant other or even sibling!!"
"A wonderful place for a small meal! ��Try the artopitas, they're fantastic and quite filling. ��Their staff is very friendly and the whole experiece is a delight."
Perfect date spot.Best Mussels in the area...yummm.Grilled Ceaser salad to die for.Atmosphere is amazing. Staff is super friendly and helpful. This is the type of restaurant that Id come to on a weekly basis. Hands down. Da bomb.
"It was alright.... honestly, it really depends on the type of person u and how u enjoy your food..."
Fun place to eat. ��Pizza was excellent and great service!
This is my favorite special occasion restaurant. ��It is definitely a culinary top chef theater for the taste buds. ��It is expensive but worth every penny. ��Out of the super high end restaurants in Chicago it is the best one.
This place is awesome. ��We just go and get apps. ��Also $10 Pre fix menu on sundays.
Came here for drinks and appetizers last night and the food and service was wonderful. great place to come right after work for a drink and apps
"I'll be honest and admit that while I don't eat out very often, I've eaten at many places in different locations and countries. Tru is my most memorable and favorite meal. Keep in mind that you're not just paying to have your food cooked, you're paying for your experience. If you have plans for after dinner, you'll want to allot the appropriate length of time. My dinner took literally three hours. My favorite part of the meal was definitely dessert and their cart with homemade treats was the best way to finish my meal. You may be like me and can't afford this type of dining experience all the time, but Tru is definitely the place for a special meal."
My favorite Italian restaurant in the entire city.
"Love, love, love this place! It's right next door to my vet's office so when we bring the puppy there we stop at 90 Miles Cafe. The food is so good, especially the guava and cream cheese pastry! Not to mention the food is inexpensive. Get the papas fritas too!The owner is such a nice guy, everyone seems to be having a great time, and you can't help but shake it to the music while you're waiting for your food! I will definitely be making the trip"
"I had the most unbelievable dinner here Saturday Night. Crab cakes, amazing. Fried mashed potatoes, ethereal. It's a really good place to take a date, with modern southern decor but kind of a sexy feel to it. I usually expect southern food to be very heavy but this was perfect before a night out with my girl. It's definitely a different take on southern food, not very traditional but instead kind of a new american version. Spot on! Can't wait to try brunch!"
"Best salad bar in the city! ��The waiter we had last night was aweful, but the manager came over and apologized and made the experience much better. ��I will go back just for the salad bar and the redeming quality of the manager...Note to the manager fire that aweful waiter who oviously is miserable at his job"
"I love the bongo room! ��The breakfast is unbelievably delectable. ��It is a little pricier, but if ��you split plates with a friend, it's doable and so worth it!"
"I've had the beef burrito which was good. ��Nothing amazing. ��However, the wings were spectacular!! ��The sweet korean bbq sauce was dynamite. ��And we're not talking about 3 inch sized wings, these were big honkers! ��Go for the wings and you'll be quite pleased."
"The first Lettuce Entertain you restaurant has stuck around this long for a reason. ��it is good. ��It's what restaurant like Chilis, Fridays, and Applebees want to be, but this is the real thing. ��Definitely a nice spot for a family dinner."
"This place is always slammed! ��It's like a Whole Foods Market with a restuarant inside - with that being said you won't be surprised that the prices are a little high for lunch ($10-14).However, the quality of the food and the views of the river from the 2nd dining room area make for a nice atmosphere."
Love this place! I live in the neighborhood and go out to eat here about once a week. They have a great special available Sun-Thur where you can get their full slab of ribs for half price. It also comes with a side of pasta and salad. Sometimes it gets crowded on the weekend but it's definitely worth the wait.
"My rating is closer to 4.5 stars. ��The only knock I have is that the crust could be a tad more flavorful.I've spent some time recently in Chicago. ��Everyone seems to have a different opinion of Giordano's; either it is ""awesome"" or ""you can get much, much better pizza elsewhere. ��I ordered pizza from this place twice (both small pizza's) and each time, I could only eat half. ��The thought of only eating half a small pizza amazes me even now. ��Most people seem to go to the restaurants but with pizza, I generally prefer ordering it since many pizza restaurants in The Loop can be quite crowded. ��I love pizza but I'm not going to wait outside for a table....no restaurant is that good.After trying Lou Malnati's and loving it, I got a small pizza with pepperoni and sausage. ��As a lover of cheese,"
"Used to be good back in the day.. Ordered shrimp kabab chicken kabab and shish kabab .. Wasnt tasty at all. Rice was bland with no salt at all. Hummus had too much garlic. I liked this place years ago, now I rather eat at that small Salam place across the street that is much cheaper for the same quality. Sorry noon a kabab I won't be back"
"Absolutely incredible sushi. Could not get enough, wanted everything on the menu! Going again for my birthday!"
"For the most amazing Greek food in Chicago, this place is a great choice!! ��They have great service and a wonderful eclectic atmosphere. ��One of the best parts though has to be the free valet outside, essential in a big city. ��I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for authentic Greek cuisine."
"good hearty chitown pizza with a slightly interesting crust compared to the others. ��combo it up with some wings, beers, and a bulls game and you end up with a pretty satisfying experience even when the bulls lose. ��expect to wait at least 45 mins if you order deep dish and the draft selection is limited, but im not complaining. ��the best part is leftovers the next morning where the tomato sauce kindly soaks with the bread overnight. ��who doesnt like cold deep dish for breakfast?"
"I came here one friday night, and was a bit disappointed. The server, Aaron, or Eric i believe his name was, was great! Super knowledgeable. I did however come into contact with one woman who worked inn the retail area who had the nastiest attitude. She was sloppily dressed, her hair looked all matted and greasy, just all around non professional looking. She was rude as all get out, as if she did not enjoy her job. I asked her for some wine suggestions, and before I could even get out what i wanted to pair it with, she cut me off & basically TOLD me what i was looking for rather than asking me what i was looking for. As a younger lady rang us out, I asked for a cup of they're coffee with a shot of Almond to-go,which i have gotten before, with no problems. I then overhear the shorter, rude "
"I've always wanted to try one of Bayless's restaurants and came upon XOCO. I guess it depends on time of day, but there wasn't a huge line even if the place was hopping. All I have to say in this review is that just the mention of pork belly and/or Mexican restaurant immediately sends my mind to the Pork Belly and vermicelli soup at XOCO. The thought of it is mouth-watering. It is hearty, flavorful, has ��a little spice, just downright yummy. I would eat it weekly (not daily only because I crave other good foods...) ��given the opportunity. A meal in itself."
pretty packed any day of the week.good saladsgreat steaksloved the breadstrong coffeegood deal
great food. kinda small place witch is not good when its hot out and they have allot of people waiting.small outside patio but if you don't mind space its a great place to eat breaded steak sandwich was Delicious.
"Yolk is a solid breakfast restaurant. If you love a good omelet, you will like Yolk. I ordered the Butcher Shop and my girlfriend ordered the Hey Ricky. When the food came back to us, we were shocked at the size of our omelets. We are talking football sized omelets with plenty of ingredients mixed in. The price is just about right, too. Our waitress was friendly and did not skimp on the coffee refills. My only complaints about Yolk was the wait, which was 30 minutes, but I suppose that comes with the territory of being a breakfast place in a busy area. Also, the seating arrangement is a bit cramped, if you sit at one of the tables in the back against the wall if feels like you are eating with the people next to you."
"Wow, this place is fantastic, definitly the best vegan food ever. ��Their cinnamon roll and gyro are heaven on a plate. I am addicted and go way too often, I just can't get enough of this place."
Best sushi....sounds odd to say that considering everything else that is amazing. But by far the sushi is fresh and always fantastic. ��love shaw's
Love this place! ��A must while in Chicago! ��Great meal for a few bucks - what a deal!
"Very impressed by the Bad Apple. We went on a Friday afternoon and had no trouble getting right in. The beer selection was top notch. Plenty of great craft brews from all over this great country and beyond. The food was fantastic. All 5 burgers ordered at our table received rave reviews. The different fry seasons were also a huge bonus. I ordered the firecracker fries. I was pleasantly surprised at the burn they offered. Spicy, but also very flavorful. The only thing that keeps this from getting a five is the service. Considering the place wasn't that busy and there were 2 server and a bartender, we should have never had an empty beer for the 10 minutes we did. All in all, I will be back."
This has got to be one of the absolute best jazz clubs in the world. ��I've never been to a better jazz club anywhere in the US or Europe.
"great people, great place!"
"I moved to the States 11 years ago from Korea and I have tried many Korean restaurants. Mostly Galbi places so when I found Crisp, it was a pleasant surprise. The Buddha bowls are great!! I usually order a small bowl with an egg, and my hubby gets his with meat and we share a whole order of Seoul sassy fried chicken. The hot pepper paste for the Buddha bowl is a little on the sweet side. Every time I am near that neighborhood, I make sure I get my korean fix. Reasonable price, clean atmosphere and great food!"
"After reading the reviews I had to try this place. ��Once I did, I realized previous reviewers were correct. ��Wonderful food for a very very low price, traditional Cuban foods, and lets not forget the fruit shakes. ��I gotta say though my favorite was the steak dinner."
This place is amazing! The food is creative and innovative. There is definitely a strive for perfection that makes Grand Lux Cafe a hit every time I come to Chicago.
"On a Sunday morning the wait was about 20 minutes only because we sat at the bar. The portions were huge, but the food tasteless. No joke, I lost my appetite after tasting it. I would go back for the velvet pancakes (or whatever they're called) and for the friendly, attentive service."
"First, I want to point out that I have over 17 years of experience in the service industry and I only joined Yelp to write this review. I have held just about every position possible inside a restaurant from bus boy to manager. I just got home from my latest and probably last visit to Gino's East. We arrived at Gino's East at 162 E Superior St. at 7:10 this evening. Upon our arrival we waited in line for what we were told would be about 45 minutes with a party of 5. I then experienced what can only be described as the worst ""wait"" experience and one of the most inefficient and ridiculous host/hostess operations i have ever seen. The host was not taking names but yet the number of people in your party and we were told to wait in line outside of the restaurant. This would have been fine if p"
"I was really excited about going here as I live in the South Loop and don't make it out here alot. The atmosphere was good, nice vibe and crowd. ��After that, it went down hill. ��The waiter was nice but not quick about taking our order or getting the food out. ��Our appetizers arrived just after the entrees. ��First, my fish was a whole fish. They would not fillet it and I ended up sending it back. ��The empanadas were okay but I would not re-order because it was just ok. ��As for my friend, he order plantain chips and they were awful. ��Deep fried hockey pucks. ��We each ate one and left the rest, really bad. ��My friend had the Cuban hamburger which he said was the best piece of seasoned meat he ever had and that he didn't need condiments because of it (good thing, since they didn't offer any). "
Yolk is one of my favorite breakfast places in the city - but be prepared for a long wait if you go on the weekend.
"I went to Sprout with 2 of my girlfriends on Sat night and it was FANTASTIC. ��I'm an avid Top Chef fan so I had *expectations* --and shockingly, our experience surpassed them! ��We did the 3 course prix fixe ($60) which is really the way to go as the pricing will end up about the same as if you did it a la carte, and you get the additions between courses of shaved ice / sorbet, a cheese course (which was a delicious take on a croque monsieur) with a wonderfully paired sauv blanc. ��I had the licorice salad, rabbit pierogis, & the butternut dessert with whiskey gelato. ��Everything was well prepared, presented, seasoned, and interesting. ��Different in a GOOD way. ��We also brought our own bottle of wine and paid a $15 corkage fee -a fantastic option as well. ��I will *definitely* be coming back "
"Came here with a group of my closest friends and did not expect much, but was completely blown away by the service as well as the food, and so here I am for the 2nd (and probably last) time writing a review on Yelp.Walked in, and thought the place was nice. Small, but nice. (3) Three floors, and a decent looking clientele. Sat upstairs and was immediately confused by the presence of Strip Steak on the menu, as well as the quantities for their Wings. I immediately understood when the Wings arrived, as they are enormous, and thank god our waitress stopped us from ordering too many. I apologize for ever having any negative thoughts what so ever in regards to their Strip Steak ��because after eating the Strip Steak Sandwich, or as we now call it: ""Heaven in a Bun"", I was in a state of euphoria "
"I agree with Scott A.'s review. ��Good food, but not good service. ��I live in the neighborhood and had been wanting to try this place for so long. ��I walked in on a Sunday morning and it wasn't very crowded. ��After being seated at a table it took about 10 minutes before anyone even came over to see if I wanted any coffee or a water. ��After ordering my coffee (which was good!), it took another 15 minutes before someone came back to take my food order. ��I ordered the eggs, ricotta cheese and merguez crepe which was really good, but they were a little skimpy on the potatoes and fruit. ��After I finished it took another long while before I finally received my check. ��What I thought would be a quick bite to eat on a Sunday morning since it wasn't very crowded, ended up taking about 45 minutes."
"The best food in the world hands down.Great customer service.It was like i died and went to meat heven,all the best meat in the world!."
"First of all, I love Rick Bayless, so obviously, the man can do no wrong. ��This place is *busy*! ��Expect to wait on line for at least half an hour if you didn't have a reservation, and you'll want to start queueing up at least twenty minutes before the place opens for the evening. ��Once you get inside, you can hang around by the bar area and hopefully wind up with a table over there, as we did. ��The service is good and the food is great. ��Not to be missed are the plantains with sour cream, and the guacamole. ��Desserts are great too."
"Let me take you back in time......drive in, to a slot, push a button, and yell your order into the crackling speaker. Then sit back, and watch the parade as cars come and go (if you're lucky, it's a vintage car night!), carhops pass by with other people's orders until yours finally arrives. Make sure your window is 3/4 rolled down, so the tray of food (complete with real salt shakers and ketchup bottles) can rest beside you. Then open the cardboard box where your hot dog is resting in its poppy seed bun, on top of some of the best french fries you've had since childhood. Make sure you order the pickle on the side as well. ��And a malted or ��root beer float couldn't hurt! Wave to the giant male and female hot dogs (dressed in their finest and with twinkling eyes) on the roof as you go!"
"The Hopleaf reminds me of some of my favorite taverns in the Pacific Northwest. ��I would recommend that any Chicago-transplant from Oregon or Washington State visit the Hopleaf for the atmosphere and fantastic beer selection. ��Try the CB&J with a beer recommended from the staff... the sandwich is a little unusual but very tasty.Also, as a side note, the staff was incredibly gracious to my friends and I the last time I was there. ��A buddy of mine fainted in the bathroom and the staff helped us take care of him before we brought him to the hospital. ��I know that's kind of weird story..."
"You are likely to wait a long, long time. ��Then you will see an overwhelming and huge menu. ��The food--I ordered simple chicken parm--was in a word ""awful"". ��The chicken was excessively pounded thin, sour-flavored, and greasy. ��The pasta that came on the side embarrassingly clumped together. ��That being said, my ten year old daughter enjoyed her pizza. ��The bread before the meal was good and the waiter and staff were doing their very best so I give it 2 stars rather than 1.The made to order chocolate lava cake was good but nothing that special.The place is huge, noisy, and if I were to give it a letter rating MM for must miss."
"This place is fantastic! I have been there several times now and the food is great! I did take away a star for the fact that last time I was there we sat at the counter and the way the manager/owner deals with people, staff and patrons, is a bit rude and condescending. Come on man, when you have an open kitchen and suck at dealing with people, take your staffing issues in the back so you don't look like a complete shmuck!"
"The unfriendly, unwelcoming attitude of the bartending staff ��is enough to keep me from ever stepping foot in this place again, despite the fact that they have fantastic burgers and a great beer list, It's just not worth it! ��We spent over $200 in drinks and food & Adam, the bartender, was a complete jerk! ��I get that they were busy, but I was actually reprimanded for reminding a bartender that I'd like a drink after a 15-20 minute wait AT THE BAR! ��(This was a different bartender.) ��I agree with other reviewers that children should not be allowed in this BAR environment in the evening. ��Save yourself a trip & spend your money somewhere that the staff doesn't act like you're an inconvenience."
"Simply the best meal my wife and I have ever had. Original and daring, but totally cohesive. Among the highlights: seaweed appetizer, so fantastically tasty and complex as to defy description, and the halibut entree, seared to perfection, mixed with fresh herbs and too many other things to count, and delicious enough to convert a seafood hater. The watercress intermezzo nearly stole the show, and along the way the service was outstanding. Spot on ambience, including just the right music. This will be a future anniversary destination. Thanks Dale!"
Wishbone is the best. It is the bomb diggity. I had the Andoullie hash and it was incredible and fresh. It had chicken andoullie instead of sausage which is even better because I am not a big meat eater and I love chicken. If you are looking for a delicious breakfast or brunch this is the place to go. They also have many other delicious plates to choose from off the menu. The service staff is also very polite and friendly. I highly reccomend this place.
"EXCELLENT place to go to if you like Jazz/Blues music. ��On weekends they have a touring Jazz/Blues band play approx 8pm-12am...and then a regular band comes up on stage 12am-4/5am, and while they are playing invite other jazz musicians from the crowd to come up and do inprov with them (something I plan to do myself one of these days). ��The place is pretty small, and the crowd is usually full...so if you require seating i recommend getting there at least an hr early. ��There is never bad music being played here. ��The place is said to have been one of Al Capone's hideouts back in the '20s."
"I went into this establishment for the first time on a Wednesday morning after rush hour, thinking at that particular time of day on a weekday, I wouldn't have to deal with the crowds which pack the place on the weekends. And I was right. I was seated immediately and eventually greeted by a very kind and polite waitress. Then it went downhill.I ordered pancakes and corned beef hash--simple breakfast fare. After sitting there for 30 minutes and seeing other groups and individuals who arrived after I did get served before I did, I proceeded to ask the waitress to please bring me a to-go box and my bill, trying to hint that it was taking unusually long. I should have had my food and already eaten half of it, by then. I had an important day long event to get to across town that I was going to "
Love! Love! Love!Always perfect for my professional dinners or after work dinners and it is walking distance from my job! Casual yet classy. You can't go wrong with the always perfectly cooked meat here.
"Wow!! Had a great meal with our kids ages 16, 12 & 10. ��Had something for everyone, even our pickiest eater. ��Stopped in at Fogo de Chao to compare and Brazzaz was a better price & atmosphere. ��Our waiter, Claudiu was fantastic... attentive and informative. ��Only downside was the coffee was weak. ��Claudiu worked to make it right though. ��Will be returning in the future!"
"There are so many treats in this building. �� I really like the hipster neighborhood bakery vibe they keep pace with. �� ��The staff is expressive and they communicate the diversity of the bakery. ��The cakes are so ornamental and ultra creative.... but can resonate a little flat on flavor. �� The best cupcakes here are the white-cake coconut and red velvet cake. They're moist ��and the coconut cream is super sweet with coconut and the red velvet has thick cream cheese frosting. Key Lime Tart.... if you like key lime, ��I think this is the best one that I've had in the city by far. ��The crust is dense and crunchy and sweet and buttery. Worth the drive across town if necessary. ��And keeping the simple things worth the mention, the coffee (Alliance roast) is so good. ��I really enjoy this bakery."
"Spectacular! Best BBQ place I've been in Chicago. No doubt!3 friends and I where there last night and had an amazing dining experience. We were first greeted by the Busser who we thought it was our server, who brought ��us some chips and house made pickles. That were ��delicious.Jay our server was helpful explaining the menu. We had so much food the table was so small for the many dishes we got. Everything was incredible. I had the sliced brisket and fries! And a side of Mac & Cheese! Best I've had! Corn bread is perfect!The place is beautiful and cozy, specially sitting right by the fireplace! We felt so comfortable we were the last people in the restaurant (bar).Amazing service to be the last people in the restaurant. Busser kept checking on us to make sure we were doing ok. Great food ama"
"My wife and I have ordered delivery from here numerous times, and always has been good. Tonight it was unbelievable delicious.The Salmon Kabobs were melt in your mouth delicious, some of the best salmon I've ever tasted and I've eaten a lot. Baba Ganouh and Hummous were amazing, and my wife's Eggplant dish was also excellent. It doesn't get any better that this meal they delivered tonight."
"THE BEST PIZZA IN CHICAGO, PERIOD! It's actually New Haven (east coast) style, but it beats anything local.They have an awesome white pizza (garlic and olive oil instead of tomato sauce). I don't drink beer, so I can't comment on that.We have taken over a dozen friends at different times, and they have all raved about it."
"This place is not too shabby. It's not that bad. If there was a 4.5, I'd give it to them, but there isn't. They can still make improvements. Well, the coffee there is not bad, although I prefer coffee from Atomix and the Barista Coffeehouse place. Now, this spot has some nice cakes. The thing that hits me is the cakes. The cakes are really good. Everything else I really haven't tried, and I can't say I recommend it, except for the cookies. The cookies are pretty good.Now, this is an independant business, so give them credit. Of course they can improve on a few things, but I think it's a decent place. The only thing they can use is some more space, maybe nicer staff, and to experiment on some of their ""goodies"" in order to get the best flavor and texture. I recommend it for the cake, and co"
"I have worked in the restaurant business for ten years and have never written a review on Yelp. ��I have never written a review on anything for that matter. ��I have been to Simply It twice now and it is amazing. ��Great service, BYOB and most importantly the food is amazing. ��i have tried a majority of the menu, because I was with large parties both times, and everything is great. ��I have worked with some of the finest Chefs in Chicago and dined at some of the finest restaurants. ��Simply It is a place that you must at least try. ��I think any of the dishes will be to your liking but the Lemongrass Chicken(hot), Mango Beef in a Coconut, and Calamari in a Pineapple are amazing in flavor and presentation. ��The price is very cheap as well. ��Try it and you will not be disappointed, I can assure yo"
"ahhh the brunch is solid, great french toast!! but it takes SO long to get seated. And why is it so noisy in there? No privacy, you just are in the middle of this big open room... i say sit at the bar or counter if your solo, its way more relaxed."
food was great! by far the best cuban restaurant i've eaten at. ��waitresses we're ok in customer service if i had to rate my waitress i would probably give her 2 stars.
"So I came by on saturday night. We had I think 10 of us all together. We came in for my friend's birthday. It was pretty busy but we had a table and the service was still great! I think it was just about everyone's birthday party that night. They were sweet as sugar. They brought our table Fried Bananas with some Strawberry ice cream with a candle in it for my friend. It was pretty just to look at! Imagine how it tasted. It was my first time there. I wasn't quite sure what to wear and whatnot. But as it turns out they're pretty casual and their customers veries from old, young and the inbetween. Niceeeeee. It's truly a great place. And they're by alot of bars. ohh yeaaa :)The fun part for me is always the BYOB. They supplied us with the glasses and ice buckets.The girls and I had such a gr"
Top of the notch burgers Amazing quality meat and great friendly customer sercive. list of beers makes u little confused but thats a good thing !!! Great spot
"This place is great! ��Eggplant app was wonderful, nice choice of beers, goulash and schnitzle were our mains and were delicious! ��Owner came by and gave us Palinka (Romanian brandy), what a great afternoon!! ��Highly recommend this neighborhood gem."
Best Greek. Fresh.
I recently went to Violet Hour with my husband the place has a great interior but the service was a little slow and the wait was a little long.
"This is a lovely restaurant. My boyfriend took me here for a first date a few months ago. It was quite crowded, and a friday night, so I think my experience would have been better if we'd come at another time, or when it wasn't so busy. The food was good, but the portions were very small. It was also VERY loud. We couldn't hear each other speak across the table. They also informed us they had no booths available, so we were sitting at a tiny table, by a major thoroughfare, and everyone kept bumping into us. It also went from chilly to hot and back again a lot. Maybe I was sitting under a vent?Honestly, I'd rather do fondue at home, than deal with the stress of this place again."
"I've been back twice since my first post and every visit has been just as good as the last.The food is fantastic, fresh tasting and the portions are sizeable.Raul is the bomb and he will not lead you astray - trust his recommendations! He'll hook you up with the best dishes they have to offer and I respect that he's not trying to sell you on the most expensive item on the menu. Everyone who works here is polite and friendly. They are always busy for dinner service but not once have I ever felt rushed to finish my meal. The servers don't hover or check in on you a million times. They let you enjoy your visit.If you haven't tried this place yet - make it happen! You will not be disappointed."
"It was okayAs a born-and-raised Chicagoan, I remember my dad taking us to Uno's, Home Run Inn Pizza and Aurelio's Pizza, so I know true Chicago deep dish pizza - the kind that only the natives of Chicago can love and know about. ��And, this ain't itI mean it's ok - especially for someone that's new to the city and think they are really having authentic Chicago pizza - but for a native, it was disappointing. �� Clearly the top layer of sauce was tomato paste from a can - clearly. ��The waitress was nice, but it was very superficial. ��I felt like I was in a commercial...Also - waiting over 30 minutes for our pizza was not anticipation worth waiting for. ��It was truly ""Meh""."
"Oh, so delicious! ��I never have a problem getting in, but it's always busy... ��and did I mention the deliciousness?The pistachio crusted chicken is my favorite entree... add a mojito and I'd eat there daily if my liver and arteries would allow it.No one should ever need to convince you to eat here... you should just jump at the opportunity. ��It's right near the Irving Park Brown Line stop... so once that opens up again, make Cafe 28 your first destination."
"Since I'm a huge pork lover this place was very satisfying. Everything was seasoned well. It was very crowded at the time so i was a it annoyed at the service, but the food made up for it. If you live in the River North/Gold Coast area, its a great walk."
"I'd love to give this place 4 stars, or even 5, because they have some amazing looking burgers on the menu. ��Unfortunately I can't. ��I thought the food was average to slightly above average. ��I wasn't shockingly impressed.I ordered the Big Texan b/c the pulled pork on top sounded intriguing. ��Sadly I couldn't taste much of the pulled pork. ��I also ordered the curry fries and I got super excited cause as the server was bringing the food I could smell the curry. ��Sadly, I couldn't realy taste the curry...:(Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad at all. ��It's a good burger and good fries. ��But i was just expecting much more from the descriptions and aromas from when the waiter brough the food.I'm still willing to give them another try, of course!"
We had a wonderful experience at Sunda. The food was amazing and the service was great! I will defintely eat there agan my next visit to Chicago!
I like to say that I am a sushi snub. i'm very picky when it comes to Sushi! The Sushi is yummy and the atmospere is very nice. If you go early evening you will be sitted right away. Later in the evening it's packed. Living in the Lakeview this a great place to go to in walking distance.
"Last evening, we held my mother's 88th birthday party at Sun Wah. ��There were 30 of us. ��Some in our group had never dined at Sun Wah. ��Hands down, everyone agreed that this is probably the best Chinese restaurant in Chicago. ��This says a lot since we are Chinese. ��The Peking duck is out of this world.I want to especially acknowledge the thoughtfulness of management who went out of their way to procure a special type of birthday pastry for my mother. ��I was told that the grandparents were sent to Chinatown to purchase the pastries. ��Considering the bustling business that they have, this was unexpected extraordinary care for their customers.Lilly"
By far one of the best sushi places in town. ��Crab Rangoon roll is amazing! ��Beats the Sushi X on Diversey.
"Contemporary and modern twists on some classic Southern cuisine best describes the tasty treats to be found at this delightful Andersonville gem. A group of my friends went for Dinner Saturday night and all 7 of us were absolutely satisfied with our experience. The place was packed and they're were long waits for tables, but our reservation was immediately honored and we were sitting in a matter of minutes. Waits for drinks can be lengthy, but we were forewarned by our waiter (Danny) as many of the specialty cocktails are very ""labor intensive"". We did wait about a half an hour for our appetizers, but were treated to complimentary boiled peanuts to tide us over. An interesting texture and bean like flavor helped us forget the wait. For apps we had the pulled pork grit cakes, potato croquet"
"Bucktown is lucky to have such an accomplished cafe, that-- for some reason-- has yet to garner big crowds. On the surface, Bonsoiree looks the part of a quiet, neighborhood joint; a place to hang out, grab coffee, and maybe write email. But behind the casual facade, is a seriously talented team of chefs, who kick out a thoughtful and fresh range of flavors.Though I've eaten brunch and dinner at Bonsoiree, I've become a brunch regular and, like another yelp reviewer, have developed a bit of an addiction to the truffle omelette. It's fantastic; perfectly prepared every time I've ordered it. And the manchego hash browns are an excellent combo for the smoky, earthy wedge of truffle heaven beside them. I've also had the grand marnier french toast, and it was stellar, as well. What about the co"
"Yes it's true...Great fish...yadda yadda yadda... but I go here mostly for breakfast. Check out that egg sandwich! it's ridiculously amazing. Super nice employees there too. Love the patio in the summer. My only complaint ever is that they need to expand. It's too small and sometimes the wait is too long (especially weekend mornings!) It's too small! But yeah, food and service is great all around."
"Amazing. ��The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the wait can get a little ridiculous during peak times. But the food is amazing and the staff is courteous. The Ahogada is by far the best sandwich I've ever had in my life. It's the only thing I get now. ��Fair warning: you can't get it to go because of the soup component.I noticed someone wrote that the sandwiches aren't large... Uh, I'm not sure how much that guy needs to eat. ��The Ahoghada is WAY a lot of food. ��(You should still order the guac though as an appetizer because it's amazing.)Never had the churros yet because I like the hazelnut chocolate chip cookie too much to pass it up.Great food, great service, avoid peak times if you can."
"I'll admit, this was my first Ethiopian dining experience, so without a basis for comparison, I'll just let my taste buds take it from here. ��Taste buds? ��Never mind, they're still recovering from last night's extravaganza. ��The highlights were: the vegertarian sambussas, the split yellow, the spinach, and the doro wat. ��The sauce on the doro wat was excellent, reminded me of mole sauce, but with different spicing and much much hotter. ��And I know the bread is meant to replace utensils and scoop up the food, but it really is the bitterest stuff alive. ��I don't think I could stomach it by itself - the acidity would overwhelm eventually, but it complemented the food well enough. ��My boyfriend also tried an Ethiopian beer, which tasted an awful lot like honey water, but my South African wine "
"Go for breakfast or brunch, but be prepared to wait in line. Menu is hit or miss... spinach salad is delicious and eggs/omelets are good too. They have some bacon-fat fried potato thing that is just disgusting. And for whatever reason, the service is just as inconsistent... either awesome or atrocious. But for a neighborhood, public house atmosphere, this place is great... The sort of spot you can bring a newspaper, chat with an old friend or treat your grandma. If you're dressed to the nines and looking for a trendy nightspot, this isn't it."
"Until last week, I absolutely LOVED Grand Luxe Cafe... ��It was the go-to place for a date, for dessert after shopping with the girls, for an employee's birthday, etc. ��The decor was extravagant, the menu was expansive, and the prices were reasonable. ��For all these reasons is why I thought it would be the perfect place to bring my visiting supervisors from New York. ��However, I've never been so wrong in my life. ��Knowing that we would have a slightly larger group (8 people) I made a reservation. ��When we arrived a few minutes late we were informed that our table was given away (understandably so although, we were spoken to incredibly rudely) and that we would have to wait to even find out how long the wait for another table would be (though there wasn't a single person waiting in the lobby"
"In an area that is getting more and more saturated with chains where your options are Jimmy Johns, Starbucks and Chiapotle it was refreshing to find an independent Cafe/ restaurant that offers you very good food at all times of the day. The food which ranges from French Toast in the morning to a fresh Talapia filet with fresh vegetables @ night was supprisingly good. Their interesting wine list has become one of the best kept secrets in the hood. I could not believe that I had choices ranging from a producer such as Bodegas Lealtanza, Rioja spain. Their Crianza I had was amazing and went well with Diablos Meat Tacos. I also found a great Organic bottle of ?Domaine Le Garrigon Cotes du rhone 2007 ( which by the way received three stars from the NY Times) on the list as well. Who ever does t"
The steak is delicious! I love the juicy steak. ��I also like the calimari which is so good. Recommend for dinner!
"Tried this place at least a year ago, and remember liking the burger. ��Went back recently and was not disappointed. ��I had the Scotch Egg, the Fish and Chips and a couple of great beers (forget the names).I will go back again next time I'm at the symphony."
"My girlfriend and I chose to try this place out for a Friday evening out and it was great. ��I normally do not go to tapas restaurants but I must say that all of the recommendations our server Ben (fantastic service, ask to sit in his section) made were tasty and beautiful to look at before I ate them. ��In particular, I enjoyed the dates and the braised rabbit agnolotti (pasta) was unbelievable. ��We ordered 9 dishes including, cheese and desert, ��and left more than satisfied. ��The red sangria also made me smile. ��Iron Chef, Jose Garces, really knows what he is doing (DUH!).I would have given them 6 stars if I could I will give my business to Mercat a la Planxa again and continue to send others their way. ��Ben's service, presentation, and the overall experience I received was phenomenal. ��Ni"
"Hella Yelpers,{In the spirit of full disclosure Pambo was tripping on four hits of Purple Microdot which was purchased earier that day somewhere near the corner of Spaulding and Albany Streets}Wandering around the Argyle St. area for hours can make a man mighty thirsty. ��We stopped inside Tank Noodle which was packed to the gills and blasting Techno Music. ��I listened for what seemed to be days on end and was amazed that Pambo had found the first Asian restaurant in the Universe that was NOT playing Lite FM. ��We were seated directly at ear level with a speaker at a corner table. ��While I love all good music Tank needs to invest in a much better sound system, for Christsakes they are busy enough. ��Not being very hungery we ordered Bubble Tea in a cool watermelon flavor and color, it was coo"
"As part of my birthday celebration, my wife and I went to Carnivale this past Friday night. It was our first time eating here and we walked away with a high opinion and plans to revisit in the future. For starters, the staff and waiters were very nice and helpful. We were seated within minutes upon check-in (we had 7:30PM reservations for 2) and were given a table on the second floor overlooking the main dining area. The space is beautiful. Formerly a warehouse, the place has been renovated with outdoor seating, a bar area and an adjoining main dining room with vaulted ceilings, brightly colored lamps, a huge glass mosaic and cool decorations.The atmosphere was fun and vibrant. Music was playing in the background during our meal but we didn't have any trouble hearing one another. In fact, "
"One day after finishing breakfast I was doing some reading with my coffee. ��The manager came up to me and ask if I had a problem, I said no, he then ask me to leave so he could turn over the table.This is the most insulting thing than any restaurant can do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I will never go to this place again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This is a great little out of the way authentic Italian restaurant that just makes my mouth water to think about.My wife and I dinned here on the Saturday night before Valentine's Day. We arrived at 6pm and took that last two-top. Four couples came in behind us and had to wait; the place was packed. She had the Salmon on Linguini and I had the Chicken Parmesan on pasta. The pasta was super fresh and obviously home made, the meal was fabulous and the service was impeccable. Cara Mia is one of our top five restaurants in Lincoln Square."
"( first decor, than food ) The new design was themed with lots of ? Sze Chuan Elements ? -- red chillies ?( for their signature spicy food ?) , Panda ( this living national treasure are mostly ?found in Sze Chuan ) and bamboo ( Panda's food, of course :-P ) The idea is to dine with the sze chuan natives ( again, the pandas). So when people are saying that they lost their old family style .... come on, think again , they are much closer to their home now. Don't just say the decor is nice -- try to understand the meaning behind it , please?As for the food, I love spicy food , and their flavors are nice , but ?it's very obvious that some of the dishes are using the EXACT same spicy sauce -- only the meat is different , some even using the same kind of meat but named their differently and clai"
"Problems in paradise???I know one of the owners (I went to high school with him) and I was very excited to be able to try Crisp and catch up. ��I have to say my order of the Crisp BBQ was just okay, but my friend's Seoul Sassy wings were fantastic...I also cannot say enough about the onion rings. ��However, I was disappointed to find out that there seems to some tension at Crisp. ��I asked for my old friend and and was told that he just decided not to show one day and that was two weeks ago. ��Of course people change in twenty years, but this was not the person I knew back in high school. ��Oh well. ��I hope they reconcile whatever differences they have and open a Crisp in Schaumburg. ��Then I could enjoy the Seoul Sassy chicken on a regular basis....as well as the O-rings."
"Very busy place so that was a good sign. ��my friend and I went on the waiting list that was supposed to be about 2-hour long. ��They had empty tables outside but apparently a private party had booked all of the patio and they couldn't sit others. ��but much to our delight, after just about 10 minutes we were given one of those empty tables as the party had ended. ��So far, so good.We both started with a cocktail. ��I did not like the taste of my cocktail and asked the waiter if he could change it and he quickly did that, no questions asked. ��We tried a few small plates: ��Greek salad was outstanding. ��Fresh with heriloom tomatoes and the dressing has lots of feta cheese in it. ��The fried eggplant parmesan balls were also outstanding. ��Tasted just like eggplant parmesans in the shape of a meatba"
"A month or so back, I went to the Purple Pig with a group of six of my closest friends from high school to have our yearly reunion. After 8 years of having these reunion dinners, we have finally found a home. ��Instantly, the atmosphere, ambiance, music, and full house (on a MONDAY!) struck a chord with us that we had chosen the perfect restaurant. ��Instantly, we could feel that we were going to have a great time. ��Not being big wine connoisseurs, the extensive wine list could have been a little intimidating; however, it was quite easy to follow. ��I was personally happy to find a wine from my grandparents' small hometown in Italy, for a very reasonable price. ��Even better, the bottle was great and we all ended up sharing many bottles over the course of the night. ��As for the food, all I can"
"I've eaten at almost every sushi place in Chicago, Coast is my #1. Great atmosphere, service and it's BYOB. I also order delivery from Coast almost every Sunday night."
the best Lentil Soup in Chicago
"This has been our favorite sushi rest for the past 18 months! We go almost every Friday night and also love the BYOB. Being a sushi fan since the early eighties (yes 1982 was my 1st experience), I've tried may places in the Chicagoland area. Indie Cafe offers some of the best sushi out there BUT what makes it even better is their prices! Many over rated sushi rests in the city with ridiculous prices on their food and wine, Indie wins hands down!! Our favorite waitress is Taya!"
This restaurant is not open 24 hours.
"I took two of my friends out to eat. Since I have heard so much buzz thru friends about this place I figure we would just check it out. We were impress with this place at first, They advertise that they are BYOB so we brought our own bottle of wine and before we even finish sitting one of the girl was telling us about the cork fee they charge, mind you our coats were still on us. Then we were looking over the menu and since no of us have been there before there was a lot to take in. One of the waitress came over and asked if we were ready to order and we told her we are looking thru the menu give us a minute and just as she left our table about a minute later a different waitress came to ask the same question ""are you ready to order"" we notify her of the same we still looking. So they left"
I came here for he first time a few days ago and I must say not to bad. The place keeps its retro look and the food has the classic taste.
"Love it.Not only do you get a ton of food for a very reasonable price, but it tastes delicious. I suggest eating in or taking out, as delivery never seems to be the fastest process with them."
WOW! Geja's has become my all-time favorite restaurant in Chicago! ButI think it's obvious that Chicago Restaurant Week must have unleashed the amateur diners. I've read Geja's reviews prior to restaurant week and noticed very few are negative. Then restaurant week comes around and so does the negativity. I have one thing to say about my fave place- IT'S BEEN IN BUSINESS SINCE 1965! Why? Because it sucks? I think not! Too bad TGI Fridays or Olive Garden didn't participate in restaurant week. Perhaps some of you would then have something positive to say about your dining experience.
"Our party of four had a very rushed dinner experience. The flatware was tossed on the table at our arrival and each course was whisked away the moment we finished. I had to grab my plate from the waiter to finish my meal ! �� If you want a quick dining experience, eat here. If you want a slower pace and equally good food, go across the street to Santorini. The skordalia is better there anyway.They also have free valet parking."
This was the best Greek food in Chicago! the service was excellent and the food was even better! Their potato salad was so amazing that my father has changed his recipe and he has been using the same recipe for years! Their desserts are killer especially the almond baklava! Yumm!!! I cant wait to go back again soon!
"I'm a Southern girl, and I like my Mexican food...but that also means, I am incredibly picky and critical about my Mexican food. Thus far, Garcia's is the only place I've been to ��that I can say I can tolerate. I usually don't even bother trying Mexican restaurants because I am always disappointed. However, their tostadas and guacamole are heaven sent, along with their margaritas, They're good and strong. And they have a variety of flavors!"
I'd say if you're willing to eat a pizza this is not the right place. But the they have a good cheese pie!
"We went there for a special occasion dinner with my husband. We really liked the decor inside, very warm and cozy. The food was good, my husband dish was a special for the evening and better than mine. We had the tiramisu for dessert, we shared one and had still enough to share the next day. And I have to admit it is the best tiramisu I had so far.Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable concerning the wine list. Something worth to mention, when we asked him for recommendation, he actually suggested a cheaper wine than the one we were looking at! And I am glad we followed his advice as the wine was definitely great.We will definitely good again."
"Only eat here if your stumbling drunk. The steak tacos are old leather clothing items chopped up and cook in Penzoil. Thats how hard it is to chew these things. And, if you have too much salsa you'll need to call the fire department the next morning when in the lavatory."
"I was extremely disappointed with both the service and the cuisine at Caro Mio, ?after having read so many complimentary reviews about the restaurant. I expected so much more from our dining experience.From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, the man greeting us at the door  owner  ?was rude. They gave us a small table in a very obscure and noisy room.The server did not approach us for at least 7 minutes without even acknowledging us during that time. The two entrees that we ordered were mediocre and warm at best. They never came back to refill water glasses or to ask if our meal was satisfactory. We decided not to order dessert or coffee because we felt we had wasted enough time and money on a very poor dining experience.We are not pretentious or snobby, but we love Italian Cuisine"
5 stars best Latin food i have ever tried!!!
"If you are a true Italian food fan this sits up there with the best. ��It's far from the corporate put together places of today (so if that's what you like you will be disapointed). ��If you want a traditional mom and pop italian restaurant that feels like an episode of good fellas, you gotta check this place out. Hopefully, I've given you a visual.As for the food, go there with an apetite. ��It is by far the best italian food that I have ever had. ��If your a fettuccini alfredo fan: try it with peas and sundried tomatoes, I guarantee you won't be disappointed."
"The pizza here was ok and the beer they made at the restaurant was horrible! ��The service also took a really, really long time. ��I'll give it another shot some day, but this place was a real let down!"
"The food is awesome! No complain in that. But the waitresses are straight up bitches. They're real stuck up for no reason. Don't even bother to check up on you. Worst 3 experiences I have had there. One of the waitresses there was holding a glass of water at the top rim where one drinks out of. That's disgusting. If you don't know the health sanitations in waitressing, please don't bother working at a restaurant."
"The past three times that I ordered they forgot a dish, or wasabi or something. They want my $, earn it. I am so over them. Learn delivery. Don't have to be a rocket scientist. They have f...up too many times, gliding on their rep and location. Not anymore. Bye Bye Indie :-)"
I eat mostly veggie- ��this place is great. My favorite is the Ruben. I took my parents there (who don't think a meal is a meal with out meat) and they also loved the Ruben.But to start things off- always always get some nochos! yum yum
"We worked with Mitchell at Alliance, shortly after taking home a preliminary worksheet to determine the general cost of a cake. ��Sure we had been to Alliance several times before. ��They have excellent coffee and the closest thing to authentic macarons this side of the Atlantic. ��So we were no strangers to the extravagant cakes on display in their window, and were almost afraid to pursue them further lest we fall in love and be totally unable to afford their product!But without all the bells and whistles of fondant design, the basics they offer are totally reasonable! ��We were treated to a lovely tasting in a private back room of the bakery. ��We were offered several kinds of cake and several kinds of filling and frosting on a marble slab, all accompanied by that delicious, fresh espresso, a"
"We went to Giordano's on a Saturday evening. We had never been there but saw a large crowd and assumed it was good. When we checked in we were told we had a one hour and 45 minute wait. You can pre-order your pizza at the when you hit the hour mark. While waiting outside near the hostess, a foreign speaking couple approached and did not understand they had to go in the restaurant to place their name on the list. It was then a young man who was waiting behind me began to tell the couple to ""get out of here, go away,"" because they had trouble communicating. I told him to leave them alone. Once I defended the couple, they young man turned his anger on me spewing vulgarities. The hostess, a very young woman, kept apologizing to me and contacted a manager. She explained what occurred to the man"
Hot Dougs is a Chicago Original and shouldn't be missed! Who ever thought encased meats could be so cool. I have to come back for the duck fat fries!
"Overall best Vietnamese food in the city.I have never had a bad meal here. My experience here has been good. Fresh tasty food, always well prepared. ��Good Pho!! menu is too big. Service is fast. Good Vietnamese food. For the price its one of the best."
I have been here twice and both times the Lamb Schwarma (spelling) was great. It is a meal on its own. The only reason they dont get 5 stars is both times I ordered soup i was not impressed but if you are looking for a good falafel this is it!!!
"+I am very happy that I tried Mayan Palace. ��The service was definitely out of this world. ��Extremely attentive and friendly. ��They check on everything every few minutes. ��Salsa was fresh, spicy and delicious.Ceviche was just amazing. ��I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner.I will definitely be going back to Mayan Palace.-(It was hard to come up with negatives, so I am being very critical here)The Steak Diablo dish could have used nicer steak. ��A few of my pieces were very fatty. ��The sauce on it was amazing though and made it a pretty good dish.My wife's red snapper with mango salsa was delicious, but definitely too spicy for her. ��It had fresh chopped jalapenos on it.My water was never refilled, even though it was empty for 30 minutes."
My daughter brought me out here one morning. It was a little while before we got a seat. I had the three apple brioche French toast. It was incredibly sweet and delicious. The prices are a little high but the food portions and quality is pretty good. I would suggest preparing yourself for a 30-40 min wait when going but other than that well worth checking out.
"Tried India House today at the request of a client. ��I was not too excited because ��I have not been a huge fan of inian food in the past and it was a buffet. ��I was very pleasnatly surprised. ��This place was packed!! ��The food was very tasty, service was good and I am now excited to go back."
"I hate to give Piccolo Sogno 5-stars because it's already crowded enough, but I have to be honest, the food was great as well as the service. It reminded me of another favorite nearby, La Scarola, only newer and bigger with a more eclectic menu.Reservations are usually tight so plan well in advance. See you there!"
"This was incredible ... the best Italian I have had outside of Italy. Run, don't walk. And please, please get the caprese."
"Hot Doug's makes the best Italian sausage I have ever eaten. ��They butterfly the Italian so that it's got a nice char all over and room for the delicious hot giardiniera to rest. ��Combined with their excellent fries (have yet to even try the duck fat ones) and a bottle of Green River, it's my favorite lunch by a long shot (and darn cheap too).Doug's always there to take your order and emphatically thank you for placing it. ��After going there for lunch a handful of times he began to recognize me, making the Hot Doug's experience that much better. ��He tells me that the sausages are either made to their recipes or bought locally. �� This place is legendary for good reason.PS �� You can, for the most part, avoid the very long lines by going after 2:30pm."
"I took a client to this location for lunch. It was just perfect, she needed a respite from work stress and the pleasant patio, wonderful and attentive service and fantastic food did the trick.We each ordered a sandwich and basket of plantain chips and both ended up taking food home as the portions were generous.We left feeling satiated, relaxed and happy. The entire staff bid us farewell with, ""See you tomorrow!"""
"It was ok. ��I went with another friend. ��Prices were very reasonable. ��The decor was also very nice.We ordered the papaya salad, pad prik king and one other dish.The papaya salad was supposedly made with fresh papaya but the only thing papaya in it was the sauce which they made really spicy and I have a high tolerance for spicy.the pad prik king was good in my opinion but there was nothing Thai about it.We also ordered this other seafood dish and it was very bland. ��Shrimp with vegetables is what I would call it. ��I would consider it more like a chop suey than Thai food. Perhaps, we just ordered the wrong dishes but I would consider it mediocre and more like a 2 star but I gave them an extra star because the curries next to us smelled decent."
This place was great! I only wish I knew about it sooner seeing how I just moved to Dallas. I went here for my going away dinner with some friends from work. My initial concern was that it was basically next to the brown line western stop in Lincoln Square. Well...to my delight there was no interruptions from Western nor the train. The food was very good and the service was fast. I had tofu pad thai and the rangoon both were great. For me it's alwasy been hard to find a good thai place but I finally did!
This Brazilian steakhouse is just fabulous. They have a good lunch special which is very well priced. They have a huge selection and a good salad bar if that's your thing. You will walk away from this place very satisfied.
"This might be my favorite restaurant in the entire city. The lobster bisque is to DIE for. The food is consistently delicious, and the service is consistently superb. The champagne brunch they have on sundays is awesome ��(try the blood-orange mimosa!). I have never had a mediocre meal at Shaws- they always blow me away. I would eat here every single day if I could."
"This was our first opportunity to try Sapori Trattoria as we were visiting from out of town. ��I had read the reviews about the Monday night special so we made it a point to go on Monday to try the $20.95 prix fixe fare.Food, glorious food, you certainly will not go hungry on Monday. ��The menu for the special was quite extensive. ��Especially for the entrees, I would have preferred a few more choices for the appetizer as a couple in our group really weren't interested in the calamari and 2 of the four choices were calamari based.We had the avocado crostini, fried calamari, stella salad, squash soup, and three entrees as well as tiramisu for dessert. ��The bread is tasty and they kept refilling which meant we were quite full before we ever got to our salad/soup course.The entrees were LARGE, a"
Thanks Stephen. You gave my date and ��I another fantastic night on the town. You are AWESOME!!!
"If you're looking for authentic SE Asian cuisine, and you know a place a better than Tank Noodle, PLEASE TELL ME. ��I have not tried much on the menu, but I can tell you this, the few items I have had there, are the best I've had since being in SE Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia). My ONLY critique of this place is that they seemed to spice our food for an american pallet. Granted I'm American, caucasian, so maybe they served us a tamed down version of what might be spicier to their primary clientele. (you know the food is authentic when you're the only americans in the place!!) But my wife and I like it traditional, so be sure you ask them to use the spice as if they were serving the locals!WE LOVE THIS PLACE!! ��BEST COCONUT CURRY I'VE HAD IN THE USA!!!"
"Complete A$$Holes...Litterally the worst customer service of any place in Chicago. They called and claimed they had a big SEWER LEAK and they had to cancel my reservation. THIS WAS 2 HRS before we were supposed to arrive. They said the place was closed for the night. The guy on the phone, SETH, claimed to be the manager when I asked to speak with one. What MANAGER takes reservation calls? To add insult to injury, they were NOT closed as he claimed, we went there and the place was packed. SHWA? GO F yourself."
"Love the meal-in-a bowl-caldos, pastries and beverage. Good price for the food. Staff are very friendly. ��Very long line during weekends but totally worth the wait."
"Best BYOB Sushi Joints I ��have been to in the city. Takes a long time to be ��seated if you don't make reservations, so be prepared to wait...they do allow you to open your bottle of wine while you wait so at least you can pass the time.. A bit pricey but definitely worth trying yourself.."
"I was back there over the weekend and had been away for a couple of years. Boy oh boy how things haven't changed. The wait staff at this place are thieves. ?they mark up your bill, they add anywhere from $15-25 extra to your bill. ?They've been doing it for so long it's almost normal. and don't you dare catch it because they get mad. ?and don't even dream about complaining to the owners. they do not take well to customers complaints no matter if it is small or big(food poisoning) they get mad at you for complaining. they are rude and have no manners or customer service skills. they have this attitude that almost sayswe have too many customers anyway so who cares what you think but wait till everyone starts paying attention and stops going for the greasy food, dirty place, rude service...th"
Good food and better service than most Korean restauants that I have been to.
"My husband dragged me to this place and I did not want to go. ��I had been there years ago and remembered the carpet and the old school atmosphere, not my thing. ��But, they got rid of the carpet and it seems less oppressive now...still very very old school but this time it was actually kind of ok, like that is just their theme. ��I ordered the broiled snapper and it was hands down the best fish I had ever had. ��I could not believe how good it was. ��I am now a fan of this little old fashioned place and I am normally a trendy place person. ��The service is old-school friendly and I even liked the wine. ��So I am now a convert."
I love their juicy hotdog. I found this place through YELP. Hot Doug's deserved to have my five star rating.
"I go to Fox & Obel on a regular basis because it's right across the street from where I work. ��Whenever I get my lunch from the cafe, I can always depend on Juanita to make sure all is well. ��If something is just not perfect, she's there to make me happy again. ��Hats off to the excellent service she always provides.DKW."
"Had dinner there. ��Damn good. ��Exceptionally good cocktails -- my Sazerac was perfect. ��And yeah, the food was great too."
"OK hot dog and very good cheeseburgers but they are completely out of line with their prices. ?As is the case with most places that receive alot of publicity and get turned into tourist traps (there were literally people taking pictures of themselves in front of the place when I visited Super Dawg), the prices skyrocket. ?If you enjoy dropping over $20 for a couple of cheeseburgers and two drinks--then Super Dawg is the place for you. ?Yes, the pickled green tomatoes are a nice touch but the food just doesn't equal the prices and all of the baseless hysteria about the place. My guess is thirty years ago, Super Dawg was a pretty good deal--before the Food Network and everything that is wrong with pop culture inflated the owner's ego and the food prices. ?Let's face it--fast food can provide"
Not much to add to all the other reviews. ��Sabatino's is a great time with wonderful food.
I like the Pepito sandwich
"I went here during restaurant week, and was satisfied with my meal. ��The salad options were great, and the meat was very good. ��I would have liked more options in terms of done-ness. ��I prefer meat medium-well to well done, but most of what they brought out was rare to medium rare. ��For dessert, we shared a papaya dessert, which our waiter claimed had digestive enzymes in it, but really just tasted like vanilla soft serve ice cream with some papaya puree. ��Nothing special.Overall a pleasant experience."
"I came here in December for my birthday after painting down the street @ bottle and bottega, my night was awesome.The food was sooo good. I've been craving it thus far. the only reason why I say its somewhat pricey is because we enjoyed drinks. The mojitos were awesome! yum. a must try.we ordered a plate that was a combo of baby octopus and steak meat w/ fried platanos (bananas) on the side which were nice and sweet just like I like them. The plate was enough for a table of three. If your ready to eat good food with laid back , relaxed scene, come here."
"New to the city and as recommend....EXQUISIT!! ��Have to try the lamb shawarma, so good I can't try anything else."
"Took my mom here for brunch. I had the goat cheese omelette, she had the oatmeal brulee. We shared the Gage potatoes. Service was a bit slow. Otherwise, it is a great addition to this area. I was glad to have a more upscale non-chain option."
"My wife and I and our two kids went on a Saturday night for my birthday dinner. ?No problem getting seated quite soon after our reservation time. ?Unquestionably a very vibrant, cool restaurant, but we come from the sticks so what do we know? Rather than ordering entrees we decided to order lots of appetizers and such and share everything. ?Here's the run-down on the dishes:trio-of-cheeses: we ordered a rosemary Manchego, an aged cow/goat/sheep cheese, and a fresh goat cheese; all were outstanding, and the crisp, almonds, and honey that accompanied them were nice additionschorizo: very good, but so intensely flavored as to largely blot out the flavors of anything eaten with or soon after itdrinks: not the best ever for their varieties, but very good, with lots of fun choices; kids had mang"
"Like my friend from Belgium said, it's probably good for american tourists...stale beer, huge choice though. The food is nothing more than bar food.Maybe I was expecting more...I'd go back but just to sit at the bar and drink probably."
"This is going to be a quick review. ��My girlfriend knew I loved Poutine (being from Canada and all) so she searched all over the city for someone that offered true Canadian Poutine and this is where we landed. ��Great, friendly service and fairly true poutine - for an American restaurant. ��The fries are thick and the gravy was a bit light for my liking, but they had true cheese curds and overall not bad poutine."
"Simply It is simply fantastic. As someone who works in the area, it has quickly become my favorite lunch option. ��The Vietnamese sandwiches are delicious and filling, come with a fresh sliced orange, and cost....wait for it... $4.50. ��It's a shame that people regularly spend $6-8 bucks at the nearby sandwich spots for something less tasty. ��On a cold day, I crave their Pho soup. I have yet to have better Pho anywhere, and I grew up on Argyle. I also enjoy the smoothies. It puzzles me that people have complained they're too sweet. The blend the fruit right in front of you, and without adding any sugars or sweeteners. ��They're delicious and refreshing.But what's really got me to 'yelp' about this place is the service. ��Simply It's staff epitomizes the friendly attitude you look for in a neig"
"I love the atmosphere in Violet hour, something seductive and velvety going on. it can get very crowded, too crowded sometimes, which at least for me, is too much at times. ��drinks are wonderful, not too pricey. great place, wish it wouldn't be that popular though."
"The Bad Apple has a great beer selection and really cool decorations. Good service. We ordered the Truffle fries (having read about them as hyped as some of the top 10 fries in the city) but were disappointed. They were too salty and to us unimpressive. Otherwise, overall a good experience."
"I've been to Chicago Mastros twice now and both times were absolutely outstanding. My husband and I travel quite frequently to Mastro's in CA and boy let me say, they have got it together here in Chicago. Impeccable service on all levels and food is out of this world. Lobster potatoes, sizzling steaks, and dry ice martinis! What more could a girl ask for? Oh, and the best part, they have a live piano bar!! Michael at the front door is nothing short of FABULOUS, he made a point to stop and chat with us on our way out and actually talked us into going to the lounge after dinner for another cocktail. Haha. This guy knows how to sell. Everyone that works here is so friendly and willing to go that extra mile. We will definitely be back. Welcome to Chicago, Mastros!"
"This place is truly as good as it gets. Don't come here looking for a boisterous time, this is casual class. Cozy and inviting, flawless service and a great menu. Not only is Third Coast my 1st choice for client meetings (and they have ALL become repeat customers regardless of where they live) but it is my favorite qo-to place to relax. Good food, great wine selection, ever changing art displays...you have got to experience this hidden gem."
"It is hard to find bakeries with such variety of cakes, cookies Everything is delicious. I love their coffees, especially the Frappuccino in the summers. ��My favorite are the almond cookies also like the strawberry shortcake. I've been going there for a lunches and sometimes I come with friends on the weekends. I love their food: spanakopitas, artopitas, salads, and moussakas"
"Simply It is the best place to do Byob with a big group of people. There is no ��corkage fee or restriction on what you can bring. The first time I went we were with a group of 10 and brought ��bottles of wine, a bottle of vodka, club soda and some limes. They accommodated us with cocktail and wine glasses for everybody without saying anything about it. The food was delicious and the wait staff was very friendly. I had the chicken fried rice and ��it may have been the best in town. I have been back twice since the first visit and Simply It never disappoints."
My friends and I love the comfortable atmosphere here. The Fifty-50 bartenders are the best and the crowd interesting and friendly. There's a laid-back feel and a nice variety of people. I haven't tried the food yet but hear only good things.
"I have so many loves in this place. The ambiance, food, and I love being able to go in quickly and leave.If you have not been here, please give it a try."
"Amazing eggs benedict. Amazing skillets.Nice service, but irritatingly slow if it's during rush hour and you're hungry.Be prepared to go somewhere else for an hour on a Sunday morning.But, it's well worth it. Amazingly delicious."
"Great addition to the neighborhood. ��Good for eating in or taking out. ��The sushi is amazing! ��Some of my favs are the sweet potato roll, kani chung and snow white - haven't tried them all yet, but each one I've tried has been fantastic!"
"Very tasty, fresh food with a good wine selection. The servers are super attentive and make excellent recommendations. The only reason the 5th star is missing is because although I like olive oil and understand that it is an important ingredient in Italian cuisine, M.F. tends to overdo it a tad on most dishes. If you are deficient in your daily intake of mono and polyunsaturated fats for the day, you're in luck."
"We came on a slower night, so maybe that was why we got so much attention, but our server and the maker of our dishes was very entertaining helping us understand each meal's creation and the best way to get the full flavor. Everything was yummy yummy with a great ambiance :). I am definitely going to revisit Simply It!"
Good persian food! Love the chicken kabob plate. Will definitely go again. Please let the hostess know to smile back at customers. Thanks!
"I have never been more disappointed then my evening last night at Spacca Napoli. ��We've heard so many great reviews about this pizza restaurant that we finally got a chance to try it. ��The pizza was the worst pizza I've ever had....under cooked crust, salty and not worth the price. ��I've lived in Italy, tried other new pizza places in Chicago and never complain about anything - this was worth writing a review about. ��To make matters worse, we had to wait in line for 30 minutes and got sat at a table that was near a messy floor (never cleaned from the kids who dumped water all over the floor). ��I would not recommend this place!"
o whats not to like.... ?.... its a straight up party
"Don't be fooled by its location and their name. it is hard to believe but after one year living in this area and I prefer to buy my whole daily shopping from here without a penny increase in our budget. Their Bakery are wonderful, finally I found a place in the US to buy a decent bread. their cheese selection, even their Veg,Fruit are more fresh and cheaper than Dominick!!!!!! The only section I can't buy is their butchery, but considering their quality, it worth to try on occasional situations. Their COFFEE are much more better than Starbucks, and you even cheaper. you don't believe that, try their streeter blend with a coffee cake or cinnamon swirl. As somebody else said I think their Dairy products are their weakest section. In general here is the place that would definitely keep me in "
"If you are looking for authentic italian ��( forget this place !!! ) I just moved recently to chicago and still searching authentic Italian food . I am oriinally from Italy and wanted to try this place reading the reviews.Atmosphere looks good. Prices look ok , But careful. !!! what ��you see on the menu is not what you actually get. I ordered ��mozzarella di bufala and got pecorino cheese instead. I also orderd ��salumi di cinghiale and got salami. 3 slices each - 12 Dollars. What !! Asked the waitress about it and she admited that most people get it confused. Well, then change the names on the menu.. Its like asking for a glass of water and getting lemonade. Also oredered pizza. Way to small not crunchy and all. Pizza and Costco is better :) Wine list is good but way overprized. Too many che"
As people already mentioned. This is the WORSE SERVICE I have been also!I had my wedding dinner hosted there. BIG MISTAKE!!The place is nice but that's it! The party manager gave me a hard time.She does NOT communicate with the people that work there.They tried to push us the most expensive bottles that they have and they ALSO tried to charge us more. They gave us a terrible experience on MY WEDDING DAY and tried to charge us as they deserved it. Oh My just don't bother people!
"I was just here earlier today (thursday afternoon) and I left disappointed. For starters my server (an Asian lady who should be fired) ��was really rude and made me feel uncomfortable, and ruined my whole dining experience. I wanted to leave immediately, but my friend felt bad about leaving so we ended up staying. However, she did try to make up for it later by being extra fake when it was time to pay. Secondly, the food was not filling and definitely not worth this much money. Stay away from this place!"
I could eat your appetizer everyday! They are great!
"A co-worker suggested Bongo Room and I am so happy we tried it! It's a little on the smaller side, and the only reason why I did not give the rating 5 stars was because we waited almost an hour. ��The food is creative and amazing, as busy as they were, our server Adam never forgot to check on us. ��We'll be back again, this time we'll try to beat the crowd!"
"A cutting edge experience for lovers of food, art and romance. ��Doesn't matter if you decide to do the tasting (12 course) or the tour (24 course) menu, you will be blown away by the presentations. I have to say not all dishes, flavor components or pairings had worked perfectly for me, but at least I can appreciate the thoughts and creativity behind each dish. ��Expect the unexpected."
"2/24/11 5:50pm - Cashier #002 - I was on way home from work last night and I decided to try Fox & Obel again. My last (3) visits I found the food to be either very bland or badly seasoned. I ��stayed away from the deli and chose the Buffalo Chicken Wrap ($6.99+) and Beef Chili ($4.00+) from the ""What's New"" cooler which is located by the $30.00 per pound Lobster tails. The wrap was terrible, the Buffalo season wasn't even close and it was so bad I just tossed it. They need to take the chicken out of the description, b/c there was barely any chicken in the wrap. You think the Chili would be like ""grandma made it."" Not even close. Whomever the Executive Chef is, he/she needs to do a tasing on all the ""to-go"" items. Also, I see many culinary employees smoking outside by the water. Do they real"
"This is my # 1 all-time top Chicago destination. Get there early (tables are tough to come by, and sneek under a cheap cover) and stay late (the music goes until the wee hours of the morning). Every night has its own feel, its own vibe. I love Sundays, when it is quiet and Gordon tears it up on a little late night Ella.The place is chill and the beer is cold (PBR on tap!) but the tunes are HOT."
"NEW HAVEN PIZZA IS A MUST!!!If you are eating in they have a phenomenal Dopplebock that pairs well with any meal. Multiple TVs with the game on, great pizza and endless growlers what else could I ask for. They also have decent delivery."
"Went there last night with a big group of people. We called ahead and the manager was nice enough to set aside some tables for us in the back. As you walk in it resembles a mini grocery store/deli. The food was amazing! I had the vegetarian combo which came with filafel, rice, salad, humus, and pita. I also couldn't resist the baklava which was sooo good! Few notes: Cash only! and BYOB!"
very delicious food. it is slightly pricey but very worth it!
"Bonsoiree is absolutely the most delicious place to eat in the city, hands-down! Every dish is absolutely delectable, unique and put forth with the most beautiful presentation. The atmosphere is wonderfully intimate, the best place for a romantic evening for two. The staff is warm and friendly, and the service is impeccable. And to top it all off, the desserts are absolutely mindblowing! (The green pistachio pyramids are the most delicious thing I have ever eaten in my life.) If you want an unquestionably perfect meal, then Bonsoiree is the place to go."
"I have never met with a cupcake I didn't like...until I came here. ��Dry cake with bland icing (no hint of sugar). ��And I tried four different varieties, none of which I would ever eat again. ��What a waste!"
Excellent place. Great atmosphere.
I love this place so much it almost makes me cry! Everything I've ever eaten has been delicious and I go here time and time again!
"Over the top food experience - Grant Hachatz is a little cuisine genius. The experience he offers is incredible, intense, surprising and delicious. The food would deserve its 3 Michelin stars. The 16 courses Menu is extraordinary. We unfortunately followed the advice to do Wine-Pairing (probably most people do that as they don't know what wine to chose). Poor decision. This is outrageously expensive and the wine do not make up for it. Our sommelier was like a robot, had no passion (or not time to share it) about the wines, border-line rude wine portions were ridiculous. On top of this, paired-wined are just OK... Go there but pick you're own wines. Don't listen to their purely economically driven advice that you should do wine pairing. Pick one white and one red and you'll be good for the "
"Have to admit have been here a few times now, and it is way over priced, and the food is at best average. ��You will have to wait awhile because the kitchen is slow, and people like to sit around for awhile after eating to just hang out. ��Maybe their best item is the bloody mary. ��Drink a bunch of these because you wont want to taste your food. ��I won't be going back to eat anytime soon."
"Came here for a second date, and although the food ranged from fantastic to subpar, the fun experience made up for any shortcomings. Our waiter was very helpful and the new twist on brazilian steak house is great. Besides the good company, going through the night together was definitely experience and would recommend for a fun time. The salad bar was delicious, and had many gourmet offerings that you wouldn't find at your typical salad bar. Afterwards when we sat down the food started to come around. Basically the fish dishes were delicious and the meat dishes were passable. Dessert was great, but was confused when we received fortune cookies afterwards without fortunes! Our waiter did his best but came up with a pretty lame fortune for the date, thanks for nothing bud!Tried to go upstairs"
"This place is great, food is amazing and I never had a bad experience there. Service is very good and attentive, they know everything about wine. I had the 8 course tasting menu last time I went and it was fantastic. There is really nothing I can say about this place, but to go and try it yourself"
"Although there are so many good steak houses in the city, we keep coming back to this one. Quality is excellent, options are fantastic, and the staff is always helpful. We have friends that moved away from Chicago and whenever they come back to visit they insist on dinner at Wildfire."
Excellent lechon! Good Cuban food! I'll be back.
"Top 5 pizza spot in the USA. ��Spectacular!I recommend the deep dish stuffed with beef. ��So good you might weep.I hate to wait ever, anywhere, but it's worth the 60-150 minute wait. ��It's THAT good.Don't waste stomach space with other stuff. ��Just wait for your pizza."
"Absolutely wonderful! I stopped in for lunch while shopping, and the waiter was incredibly friendly and the food was divine! I'd definitely recommend friends here! They were rather quick to, I was expecting to wait but didn't!"
"Chicago. ��I'm sorry. ��You just don't know what good Lebanese food is. ��Maybe, you personally didn't vote for this being the best Middle Eastern in Chicago, somebody keeps doing it. ��I guess I'm spoiled because I come from Detroit and the Dearborn area surrounding it has the largest population of Middle Easterners outside of the Middle East and therefore has tons of excellent Middle Eastern restauraunts. ��I've been searching for a good one in the entire Chicago area for almost six years and just haven't found one that holds a candle to the Detroit establishments.  �� �� This place, to me, is just flavorless. The hummous is lacks any bite to it, the baba is funky, the grape leaves mushy. ��There isn't tahini sauce anywhere to be seen. ��People, do yourself a favor, and if you happen to be going "
"This is my favorite take out place, I have never had a bad meal here. You must try the pizza."
"I had dinner at this restaurant last Sunday. This is what I found:-The food is NOT authentic latinamerican cuisine.-The drinks are good. We tried the sangria and mojitos and they were really nice. I do recommend drinks here.-The place is pricey: we were a party of five and the check was $370+-Pineapple cake was a major disappoinment. It came undercooked so I ended up with an upset stomach.-Service was good -coat check lady and hostess were very nice, our waitress did a good job explaining items and bringing our food/drinks on time.Will I come back? ��I don't think so. I mean, I do know ��(and love) latinamerican cuisine and I didn't find true latinamerican cuisine in Carnivale."
love the porkchops&rice!
I'm a pretty picky eater. I really enjoyed the meal I had here. I didn't have high expectations because I felt like an upscale tapas was going to just be overpriced and mediocre. I WAS WRONG!The food was so good :) The cheeses are paired with really yummy sauces. The Cadi Urgelia cheese with the sherry-bacon caramel sauce was my favorite. The Arroz a la Cazuela soup was pretty good too. The Wagyu Zabuton steak was absolutely delicious. The Conill Amb Castanyes (braised rabbit) was very good. It wasn't gamey at all and very flavorful. I was so full by the end of the meal! I would definitely return for another meal.
very average. no complaints. just average. good drinks though.
"Got the chance to try out Graham Elliot a few weeks ago, and was pleasantly surprised. Wasn't sure what to expect going in, and found that my fear of items being too gimicky was totally unfounded. The three dishes I was particularly nervous about, were the truffled popcorn, which was addictive and fantastic, the foielipop, which I could have done without, and the twinky ceasar, which was really yummy. The rest of the dishes on the 10 course each had a truly delicious component in them, but were sometimes surrounded by too many superfluous additions. Some worked, but many lacked a coherence between each of the ten layers (ok, I'm exaggerating) in the dish. But as I said, when it worked it worked. The desserts were outstanding. You can tell the Chef has a sweet tooth throughout his savory fa"
We will never step foot in this place again!On 7/24/10 we had the most insulting experience at Greek Islands. 2 years ago our Best Friend had met his soul mate in the Greek Islands Restaurant. We had planned a Greek Town Pub Crawl with 14 friends when we arrived at Greek Islands and from a distance our best friend seen his soul mate in the crowd. As she did not notice him yet our friend pointed her out and said she will be my wife one day. As the night progressed he made eye contact with her and went over and spoke to her from then on they lived the fairy tale Love at First Sight. Now 2 years later our best friend wanted to relive the fairytale and had all same 16 friends come to dinner including his soul-mate waiting to purpose to her. One week prior we tried to make dinner reservations o
"Delicious food and excellent service! ��I went to Sunda for the first time with a group of ladies, and we had a fabulous time. ��What a great place for a night out! ��We loved the oxtail potstickers, the crispy rice with wagyu beef, the rock shrimp and the devil's basket. ��The dragon roll was outstanding, but my absolute favorite was a new addition to the menu, a lobster roll with avocado and pieces of bacon sprinkled on top. ��I absolutely cannot wait to go back to eat it again! �� Our server was very attentive and kept the cocktails flowing. ��Can't wait to go back!"
The best pizza in the world.......PERIOD!
F-A-L-A-F-A-L!!! everything is so good. and cheap!
Great Mexican food and some of the nicest waiters I've met. ��I skipped the margaritas but my husband made light work of them. ��We both remarked that after eating what seemed like a giant meal we didn't feel like we needed to be rolled out of there. ��Great guacamole!
"Meat. An obscene amount of it. I don't know how else to describe Fogo de Chao. We went there last night, it was me and my boyfriend's first stop for Restaurant Week. The Costela (beef ribs) were my favorite, followed by the filet wrapped in bacon, and the pork sausage. The lamb was also divine. Who am I kidding, it was all fantastic! Perfectly seasoned with a delicious flavor you can only get from grilling over an open flame. What surprised me was how good the salad bar, sides and desserts were. Make sure you have room to try everything or you'll really be doing yourself a disservice. The caramelized bananas were my favorite side, and the cured meats served at the salad bar were to die for. They also know how to make a damn fine mojito. For dessert we had turtle cheesecake and cr��me br��l��e"
"I understand slow service when its slammed, but slow on off nights is stupid. That said, good spot. Kasey is best mixologist in city, by a long shot."
"hello scenesters and glitterati. ��this is where all the beautiful people in chicago go to eat sushi and asian food. ��i've been here a couple times since they opened and i have always had a great time. ��the scene and decor are both gorgeous. ��MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION THOUGH, especially if you are going on a fri or sat, or you will NOT get in. ��even week nights are pretty crowded. ��if you dont have a reservation, you MIGHT get a seat at the sushi bar or in the lounge. ��anyway... the food is amazing. ��yes, it is a bit expensive, but you're really paying for the service, scene, and personal attention. ��everytime i've been there, either the manager, chef, or a guy named uncle paul comes over to our table and asks how our meal is or brings us something special like sake or a free dessert"
"We I told them it was a special evening (anniversary) . They sat us next to a family dinner with small children, we asked to be moved. But after that it took for ever to get served. Nice place, food is good but, service needs to improve!"
Love it!Love the decor inside. ��Its a big place so although it gets crowded you don't feel too cramped.OMG - the mac and cheese is awesome.I have always had awesome service there too. ��Great place in the neighborhood!
College kid review**************I was at an event Loyola universitiy hosted and man oh man this food wuz goooood!!!!!!!!I kept coming up fo more food and eventualyl asked where dey got the catering frum. dey sed a vietnamese place down in linconl park and i came down there to check it out myself. this place so good imma hav to come back and order more. Dined in twice on a weeknight we gunna have to bring bak some friends on a weekend night!!! good food!!!!!!!!
"Great food, desserts, etc.--comfort food for vegans. ��Love that it's always busy, and I always get a good vibe from the diverse group eating there. ��Portions are huge and reasonably priced.My complaint--GO ALL VEGAN. ��At that point, it will have 5 stars from me."
"This isn't your typical gastropub! ��While I expected more contemporary food than fish and chips, this was a much more adventurous dining experience than I even anticipated. ��In fact, we were a little overwhelmed by the menu and followed our waiter's advice: duck rillettes, a venison tartare with an egg yolk on top, dumplings with shitakes and sun dried tomatoes, and a lobster dish. ��They were all so different than anything we'd eaten at an Irish restaurant; some were more delicious than others, but all great. ��I'd definitely recommend this memorable meal! ��They have your typical variety of draft beer (nothing out of the ordinary) and the cocktails were interesting but not fantastic. ��Service and atmosphere were warm and friendly. ��Check it out!"
"Tank Noodle restaurant is the best place. Food and service are great. ��The servers are friendly. Sometimes, the servers got wrong complaints by bad Koreans, I felt unfair for those servers. I just hate Koreans - so mean!"
"This is the best Persian food in Chicago -- so I'm told by an Iranian friend.Quite aside from his words, I like it a lot. ��Of their kababs, their ground meat one is my favorite. Oddly enough, the more expensive filet mignon is less enticing; it's been too chewy the times I've tried it. ��Their salmon is also very good, fresh and perfectly done. As for rice, the dill rice is both traditional and clearly the best.Their hummus and babaganush were very good, though not extraordinary. Desserts look like the Middle Eastern classics, whichto my taste buds, come through as all the same.I've both eat in and taken out -- they don't stint on the take-out, and itsvery reasonable, even if you have company. I can almost smell that dill rice.....mmmmm. It's worth a visit just for the rice."
"Lived in Miami for several years and this place takes me right back. Have yet to try everything on the menu but what I've had revealed no chinks in the armor of one bad ass Cuban restaurant. Prices are very reasonable, portions are filling but not overwhelming and the Cuban coffee might be..... no, without a doubt is the best I've ever had."
Great salads. (Asian Chicken is my favorite) Better for lunch and with people who are visiting. Advice: put your name on list and then shop on Michigan for a bit. Typically a line.
"Can anyone say pretentious? ��Once we were inside, the experience was fine but the line experience was a little much. ��It would be one thing if you had to wait in line and people were seated in the order that they arrived. ��But it seemed like if you were in with the door guy, then you got to go in front of everyone else. ��I mean who is this establishment kidding. ��This is Chicago - lighten the fuck up!"
"Nice place, and very classy. ��I love the unusual decor and ambiance. I would also say the bar staff fit the decor of the restaurant, adding to its mysterious bordering creepy vibe. Bartender was great and cracked open the bear bottle with another bottle, a trick I would love to learn sometime. He was also pretty knowledgeable. The hostess was a little rude when seating us, but not a big deal. I was hungry but their menu was less then appetizing, with only about 10 or so items (half of which i did not even know what they were). My friend ordered something i can't remember what and did not like it. He was sick all night and funny enough was our DD (aka he was not drinking more then a beer). The place seemed a little uppity to me, but maybe it was just not for me. Over all service was good, a"
"So everyone I know raved and raved about the Bad Apple and how amazing it was and I've gotta say, I was not that impressed. Maybe it was the burgers I chose to order, but it was not all that great. I've definitely had better. I will say that the service, their fries, and their incredible selection of beer which tends to be a weakness for me was fabulous. I tend to always go with my trusty ole Allagash White Ale, but I'm always up for trying something new there. I definitely want to go back cause I definitely see potential, it could've just been an off night with the wrong burger. However, I don't think I'd be willing to wait as long as we did (30+ minutes after 8p.m.) for a burger. It's no Kuma's."
Great tasting food. Dill rice was very tasty- first time I had that. And the kebabs were very good - lamb was the best. Tiramisu was average ... Drinks were great too. Will be back
"We loved this place! ��My sweetheart took me here for Sweetest Day and it was an amazing total experience - from the decor to the personable staff to the wonderful 'Iron Chef' food! ��We spoke with one of the chefs which was informative. ��After a variety of tapas (try anything!) we had the round chocolate churros (yummo) and took a walk around the beautiful Blackstone Hotel. ��Overall, this is a must for food lovers and we will visit again soon for more tapas....."
Not happy with this place anymore very dirty and managers do not care. This was a good place 2 yrs ago. I am so glad you can spend your money somewhere else Chicago has great place like Ditkas great food and serve for your money!!! Skip Grand Lux they could care food and serve is horrible
Wow...I had a fabulous meal again. We started off with soup....vegan chikin rice Oh My God! Our server hyped it so we went with it...they need to bottle this stuff or keep it on the menu everyday....I closed my eyes with a mouthful and it took me back......oh to be a kid again. It was simply fabulous. After the soup we dove right in to the mushroom appetizer...it was lightly breaded and dipped in the magic sauce made my mouth melt. OOOH that SSSauce! The entree was also mighty tasty..some rolled tortilla thing with killer salsa. The name of that one escapes me now but was a bit over the top. I wonder who writes the descriptions on their daily ��menus....its kind of queer...in a bad way. If its the chef..they should stay in the kitchen making that soup! Ok back to the food. ��The tortilla thi
loved trying the different types of wine that were paired with the meals. Flight sized glasses are amazing and you can try a lot of new blends. Food was okay..wine was fab!
"Fantastic Pizza! ��Took the whole family and were treated very well. ��Even the 4 year old loved the deep dish cheese pizza. ��Great servers and fun environment. ��Be prepared to wait for a bit for the pizza, but once it gets there you won't be disappointed. ��We were looking for a great Chicago style pizza and we found it. ��Reasonable prices and easy parking."
"Whatever to the good reviews here. ��This place is really great at being really bad. ��The food stinks and the place was a mess (including the bathrooms, which is a deal breaker for me).There's good stuff going on in this neighborhood, but this isn't one of them!"
This place was incredible! Every dish was served to perfection. I love dining here after work with co-workers. Reservations can be a bit tedious...overall it was a magnificent appearance!
"There food is pretty good for what it is, but the last time I tried their cheese steak...it was a bit too salty for me. I do need to try their milkshakes though."
I don't even eat pork and I love the purple pig! ��Small but cute inside (albeit there are always a fair number of tourists given the location on Michigan ave) but still love this place!This is a great place for a leisurely weekend lunch with wine. ��We've never had to wait very long for a table in the late afternoon.Best meatball slider ever. ��Order it. ��I also love the octopus. ��And then the whipped feta.I like the portion sizes because you can try a lot of things.
"I think this is the best pizza in the city, bar none! I have only been there once but the experience is incredible. I did try to go again last night with my husband but the wait was an hour and a half. So week nights are definitely easier to get in. The seafood pasta was also top notch. I won't let the long wait discourage me."
Best place for good food and awesome beers. I've never had a bad beer from here and I try a new one each time I go. The food is also awesome I recommend the CB&J or the ham sandwich...yummy!!!! I recommend going early because it is hard to get a seat.
"The salad bar has a good selection, and the food is pretty good. ��The menu is fun and most of the people working are in good spirits. ��Unfortunately we got the one that wasn't as our server. ��The place wasn't busy when we were there, but she was still very slow and inattentive. ��It was hard to get new plates, new bowls, drink refills, etc. ��Luckily some other servers noticed us and filled in where she lacked."
"My wife and I went for brunch on December 30. The wait wasn't terrible. The beer list is solid, and the bartending is knowledgeable.My wife had the chicken sandwich, which came out pink and had to be re-fired. We are expecting, so it was a bit of a letdown. I had the sloppy joe, which was savory, although a bit on the skimpy side. ��The fries were a nice surprise: crisp, tasty, and consistent. ��But for the chicken sandwich issue, everything was on point, and consistent with the other reviews.I may try dinner, but I will be coming alone, or with friends."
"I tried this place for the first time. It was packed and our table were next to other table which i didnt care too much about. Fondue was nice experience, seems like product (meats, seafood, cheese) were good quality. However i didnt know that you pretty much deep fry everything which is not that good and healthy, i know some Asian places use water instead. Indoor air quality was not sufficient in terms of ventilation, therefore i got a headache from burnt oil and my coat absorbed lot of that smell too. Interesting place, but i wouldn't come back. Im happy i tried it though. Its expensive, seems like they are trying to sell you an experience rather them nice prepared food."
The raspberry and apricot kolaczki's are delicious but get there early because they sell out fast! ��Yum
"I had high hopes for Atneprima after reading the other great reviews but it fell far short of my expectations. I started with the veal meatballs. they were good, not great. My boyrfriend started with the polenta. It was ok, but we both thought it was too salty.We both ordered pasta for our main course. I had the pesto with clams which was way too salty...the salt completely over powered the pesto. The pasta itself was fresh and could have been great if paired with a better sauce.My boyfriend had the fava bean ravioli. I like it much better than my dish but it was nothing special.The best part of the meal was the wine. Great selection and the by-the-glass servings are huge!"
"I love the chicago diner! it is probably one of my most favorite vegan places I have ever been to! both times I went I was living on the road with work, so delicious vegan specific food was often hard to come by. Chicago diner's food is delicious and totally affordable. I've brought my omnivore friends and they loved it too. Service is always very helpful and patient. I would say that if you gave up meat because you dislike the taste of meat, some of these dishes might not be for you. Their chicken fried steak fooled my meat eating friends. But there are non mock meat options as well; ��their mac and cheese was wonderful. Cheesecakes there are a must. I like that they have raw options as well. if you're on a road trip ��and could swing by chicago, or just want an excuse to go to the windy ci"
"I ordered delivery and it arrived at my house literally 15 minutes after I hung up the phone (maybe I live too close for delivery and should have picked up myself..but it was rain/snowing..). I had the big buddha bowl with tofu which is huge, filled with veggies and super delicious. I also tried the fried mushrooms which were excellent. This will become a new regular spot for me!"
"The first person I met in your restaurant was so full of attitude that I was grateful when there was a wait. ��""The Reservation Name...?"" poured out of his mouth with such unwelcome, and condescension, as if too say, ""how could you possibly expect to get a seat in this restaurant tonight without a reservation?"" ��We were all on the same page... you and I both knew that we didn't have a reservation. ��If you did think we actually had a reservation, you never would have approached us with such an attitude. ��Too bad, all we were looking for was an idea of the wait time, and an invitation to the bar where we would have gladly dropped cash on drinks while we waited. People who are looking to dine in Andersonville, eat elsewhere... Calo, Great Lakes, the new Vincent, which had less open tables, and"
"What a terrible experience. ?The manager was arrogant, rude, and would have nothing to do with any suggestions we gave him. ?We were placed directly next to a loudspeaker. ?Halfway through our dinner, this awful musician started playing music with the volume cranked up. ?The manager's response to us suggesting that he tell guests of the possibility of loud music in our ears in the middle of dinner was, Well you guys didn't have reservations anyway. ?Watery sauce on the pasta and ribs as tough as a hockey puck are just the tip of the iceberg."
One word: Amazing. Words cannot describe this meal. Recommend trying it for yourself.
"Good atmosphere and prices. A bit of a wait to get a table, so you may want to call ahead. Wait staff was friendly. Above average food and solid portions. They have little glasses, and black and white photos of all the waitresses who have worked there hanging on the wall. Other than that, teo thumbs up!"
"One of my most favorite restaurants in the city of Chicago - not to mention the most amazing maitre d', Monisour Raphael. My family has been going here for years. It's a luncheon staple with the girls, and always a romantic dinner with my husband. Best French Vietnamese south of Argyle St.Consistent with a wonderful ambiance and flavors to die for."
"The food here is good. ��The staff rushes you non stop but in their defense there is always a line out the door. ��I would suggest taking reservations to avoid rushing everyone after making them wait for extended periods. ��The people working here are never warm or friendly. ��They have good coffee and fresh juice, just a bad attitude. ��I like going here and the food is good but I have just had better as the rating suggests. ��There is nothing that makes this place unique other than a large menu. ��The chairs are small wooden chairs from a grade school classroom pushed tightly together. ��If you go here you will not be let down nor will you be impressed they are strikingly average."
best Cuban food ��and great ambiance. You can never go wrong with any dish you wish to order. A wonderful place for a date as well as one of the best Sunday brunches in Chicago.Named by Rachel Ray one of the best brunches on the country and we must agree.Love it!!Ed P
"My friend and I were in Chicago for 2 weeks and tried many different resteraunts. Short and sweet, Brazzaz was the best for service, selection and quality of food. We wen back twice! Highly recommend it!"
"so we had heard so many different things about this much awaited and confusing concept... we had to give them a try. the exterior of the building is made of common jagged stone that alone wouldn't look like much but, its impressively beautiful in a simple and natural almost and i hate to use the word organic way. the patio and exterior are really calming but exciting too, we entered into a large, somewhat empty room but for the lack of other diners the room felt full of positive energy. the staff was pleasant and it was refreshing how respectful and formal yet down to earth and happy they seemed? so the room is grand there is no doubt, strong but warm. i loved the art work! big blown up photos of simple foods. are these the ingredients of what we were about to eat? where these photos taken"
"Fabulous food, great decor both upstairs and downstairs. ��My only complaint is that I do not like eating in the dark."
"They sell the best hummus ever!!!! the food is awesome for the low $ you pay! I live in Elmhurst and to go there it takes me about an hour, but it's sooo worthed! YUM YUM"
"I had been to Longman & Eagle twice prior to my latest visit. The first time I had the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe which was good, not great. I was impressed with the thinking outside the box, but the deep fride sage was a little over powering for me. The second time was just for drinks. While I have not been impressed with their cocktails, I almost had a heart attack when I saw the whiskey list. This past time I went, I was set on one dish until I asked a question to our knowledgeable waiter. I decided on the Venison leg with spaetzle and piggy sprouts. What are piggy sprouts? Brussle sprouts cooked in bacon fat. This was easily one of the top 5 meals I've ever had. It was amazing! I'll be back many times, but I'll stick to drinking my whiskey on the rocks."
"Service: 1 starFood: 3 starsWe had done carry-out from India House a few times and thought the food was pretty good, and the portions pretty big. So even though the menu was pricey compared to our favorite Indian places up north on Devon, ��it was worth it if you just gotta have some naan in spicy sauce.The food is not as good as Klay Oven, the meat was not as tender and the sauces not as smooth and flavorful, but if you like Indian food and you don't want to make the hike up north, it'll do in a pinch.So when the Groupon came around, we thought we'd try dining in. Big mistake. A busy Friday night, they kind of forgot about us for 15 minutes, twice. When we did finally get to our check, they wanted the balance after Groupon to be paid in cash and we just happened to be low on cash, short by"
Love this pizza ! ��One of the best I've had. �� ��BIG FAN !!!!!!!!!!!!
"I don't know what to say, other than, certain things are to be expected at higher end places - like higher standards in behavior from staff as well as the customer. ��Sometimes a server can seem a little uptight - but that's infact part of their job - to do their best. The food is impeccable. ��The staff is a genie in a bottle wanting to grant your every wish - even put your purse on it's own purse stool beside you. ��And for those that don't get that - don't go to TRU. �� A little pretentious - without a doubt, but that is the culinary style. ��And to be expected - like going to a Mexican restaurant, and expecting Mexican accents and possible diarrhea afterward."
"Korean fried chicken is muy delicioso!!! The sauces were tasty and the chicken was tender and juicy. Just the way I like it. I do feel they're a little over priced for the actual portion size, but they definitely know their chicken. The staff is fun and quirky which fits the neighborhood. And I love that they have coat racks to accommodate their patrons during the fall, winter and spring months since their seating has a tendency to be a bit awkward (it's arranged as if you're joining a bunch of strangers at a hibachi grill). I hear the salad's are awesome and they're next on my list to try."
"Love their bubble tea. ��I had mango one,it was very good . If you re big fan of bubble tea DONT miss this place!"
"I have only lived in Chicago for 4 weeks and have been there twice. I dream and think about this mouth watering fresh food!! It is a great restaurant. The food is out of this world, always get appetizers and split, because you really don't want to miss out on anything! The scallop and lime salad is amazing and the beignats are great too!! The cocktails are great too especially the Lychee martini! Great great food. The atmosphere is perfect, I prefer to sit upstairs because its more exclusive and only light by candlelight. I go around 9:00pm , its just on of those places you go kind of later. My fav in chi town!"
Fabulous!!!! ��Ask for a single pancake or piece of french toast to share among your table...best in the city.
"Today was my 3rd time to Zed 451 for brunch so obviously I loved the place. ��Today was a disaster! ��I invited 3 friends along, 2 of which had never been. ��We had a 1p reservation and were IGNORED trying to be seated while others were being seated and many tables sat empty, 20 minutes later finally got a seat. ��So there is a 'Harvest Table' and then passed items. ��The Harvest table was not replenished ��and some items were never available even thought the server raved about them. We received the passed items in a terrible order, such as, 'now that your finished eating how about some of our fabulous bacon'. ��We were passed over for the crab cakes with poached, eggs, turkey, and buffalo chicken and waffles. ��That is quite a few items AND we requested out server have them sent over multiple tim"
i can't think of a better restaurant for my first review. i love this restaurant. my family orders here twice a month. my 3 year has been hooked on their pad thai since he was 18 months old. Having tried multiple thai places - this one is the best. they are really fast. fairly priced. and have authentic food. 2 thumbs up.
"We gave Nuevo Leon another chance after we were unimpressed the first time around. ��What a mistake. ��First of all, the floor of the restaurant was caked with dirt and grease. ��And the food was not good at all. ��I ordered the shrimp fajitas which were mostly peppers and onions and very little shrimp. ��The flavor was blah. I've had way better Mexican food at several other restaurants, such as El Milagro. ��If your looking to eat fresh, authentic Mexican food, don't go to Nuevo Leon."
"Best seafood restaurant in downtown Chicago. It's pretty pricey but ��worth every penny. The seafood is fresh, especially the oysters. Bartenders and waiters are fantastic! Super friendly place and you can't beat the live music."
"Party over here! Thats what it felt like when I ate here last week. The wait staff was very friendly and upbeat and also very prompt. If you want to make it a casual night or a fancy night, you'll always feel comfortable at this place."
"My husband and I support organic sustainable foods, small businesses, we take part in organic coops, put our kids in Waldorf school and so on. When we go out to eat we like it to fit our philosophy (which is rare to start with) ��good organic healthy food made with a bigger picture in mind. We were very exited about uncommon ground because it seems to fit some of our needs. Everything what fine, organic wine, good food, good service until someone ( I suppose it was the manager?) came rudely interrupted our conversation and said: I am sorry to interrupt but I have a full house and you need to leave. Well that was brusque! Although we tried not to let it bother us and left right away, it did leave us with a bitter taste in our mouths and actually our hearts too because we do like the place.."
"So, being from Texas, I was weary of eating Latin American food up north. However, my worries were for nothing. Carnivale was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. While a bit on the pricey side, the food you will eat will make it worth it AND more!The guacamole is amazing! Get some to start off with.Both my boyfriend and I had the pollo estillo billy. DELICIOUS.Absolutely fantastic!"
Yummy food!
"The food was forgettable and the price was definitely too steep for my taste. ��Though I will admit, the sweet tea was delish!"
I hobbled here with my mom the day after I had a minor surgery. ��The staff must have known that I was suffering because they treated me with incredible kindness. ��Most importantly the pizza was excellent as was the salad. ��Have been back a few times since but the service wasn't nearly as good. ��This place is not to be missed though-- delicious food for sure!
"It went to Grand Lux for lunch with a friend about a week ago. The inside looked really nice and the place was really big. But there was nothing too special about it.We were seated right away and our waitress came by soon after. She was really nice, I have no complaints about the service. I ordered a lemon sauce salmon with rice and quite frankly, it wasn't very good. Maybe I just don't have a taste for lemon sauces but it tasted very sour.My friend ordered the waffles and chicken brunch item and she did not look very satisfied. Will I go back for lunch? Maybe. I like to give places the benefit of the doubt. Maybe my selection wasn't that great. However, I think I'll give other places a try before rushing back to Grand Lux."
"Love love love love love love love Spacca Napoli. ?Spacca offers an enjoyable and unique experience that is well worth the wait! ?The pizza at Spacca never disappoints - you never run the risk of trying something new and thinking to yourself, Eh, I wish I'd ordered something else. ?Spacca is so delicious and offers such a warm, unpretentious atmosphere, I would go on a full stomach just to enjoy the company and order something to have for lunch the next day - and I have. ?If I could, I would give Spacca 10 stars."
"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!!!!A group of about 30 guests for a birthday party was held in this supposed to be a ""classy restaurant"". THE EVENT WAS A DISASTER!!!!They don't want to serve food , as if EVERYONE IS BEGGING FOR FOOD!!! And the group paid almost 2,000 dollars. Birthdays are supposed to be happy events and the celebrant and the wife has to text everyone for the TERRIBLE FOOD AND CUSTOMER SERVICE that this restaurant had done to us.They are charging us for extra ""ghost"" people in the bill as if we cannot read and add the charges.WHOEVER IS THE OWNER OF THIS PLACE MUST DO SOMETHING ��OR ELSE YOU WILL BE CLOSING SHOP SOON!!!!WE FELT THAT THE GROUP WAS NOT TREATED FAIR AND RIGHT!!! I WILL NOT EVEN GIVE ANY STAR TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!!!!!! I have to put one star so my review will be sa"
"Well, well, well Mr Bayless although it was wonderful to see you...happily posing for pictures and looking well I have to say I was not impressed!My Fiance and I are regulars at Frontera Grill, the waiters know our names! So of course when I read about Xoco I was highly enthusiastic and eager to get there immediately! We visited Saturday, their first since opening. The line was not as long as we'd anticipated...two blocks I'd read in some earlier reviews! We were told the wait would be about 40 minutes by an employee. A diner leaving told us we'd be waiting an hour, she was right! What I didn't read in the reviews before going was that the line also snakes around inside which took a further 25 minutes!I decided on the Cubana tortas until a member of staff informed those behind us it's real"
This is the best Brazilian steakhouse ever (even better the the ones in Brazil lol). Not only the food is great but the venue itself is amazing. The wine rack with the girl hung by wires is really cool.
"This restaurant was absolutely fantastic. It is intimate, and the food is just wonderful. We had an early reservation, so the restaurant wasn't full when we first arrived, but even after it began to fill up, it was very pleasant. Our waiter was wonderful, informing us of every aspect of the menu. He checked in often, making sure each course was going well and that we had everything that we needed.I was very impressed by the food. We had the Combination, and it was very, very good. The dipping sauces were fantastic. Both the cheese (pre-main course) and chocolate (post-main course) fondues were great as well. I was worried it would be too much food, but the portions are plentiful without being excessive. I was very impressed, we had a wonderful time!"
"I have been coming to this place for years, despite the repeated warnings of co-workers who have gotten sick because of food-born illnesses from that place. ?Not again. ?I went yesterday and two thirds of the people at my table got violently ill after lunch, including myself. ?We called Meli and they could not have cared less. ?In fact, they acted put out that we had the nerve to interrupt their afternoon with our calls. ?The response to me was what do you want me to do about it, just pass a message along to someone?.I will never, ever dine at Meli again. ?Everyone who complains about their service in reviews is correct. ?And now they get a zero on food, as well."
The empanadas were great and the chocolate drink is to die for! The only drawback were the long lines but with Baylesses celebrity I doubt the lines will shorten anytime soon.
"I've been going here for years now and just can't say enough about the place but I'll boil it down for you. �� First, Frozen Mango Margarita... the best I've ever had. ��The are perfectly tasty and potent as well!! You should have one right now... seriously. ��As for food, my staple is the fish tacos, but the steak tacos and suiza chimichanga is quite good. ��On top of it all the staff is great and always remembers us and our friends. ��Go... you won't be disappointed"
"As so many others who enjoy macaroons (macarons) have mentioned, it is so difficult to find good ones in Chicago! But alas! Alliance Bakery has come to the rescue with some help from the famous king of macaroons, Pierre Herme. ��The owner of this shop studied under him and has saved all of us macaroon-lovers from the hard, tasteless macaroons that haunt much of the city.Personal favorite is the raspberry rose. Go get them now before I do."
"Their stuffed pizza is almost as good as Nancy's, not quite as spicy. Good crust and generous cheese. I would skip the pan, kinda wishy-washy and the thin crust is mediocre. Pat's has the best thin crust hands down.Not a true Chicago deep-dish experience like Uno's or Lou Manalti's but darn good eatin'. My son's favorite."
"Huge menu, affordable pricing, excellent food. I had a great expierence at this location as soon as I moved from NY to Chicago. The wait staff is nice and polite, and this truly is one of Chicago's hidden gems. Found this place on Check Please on channel 11!"
"Holy crap. ��Let's just say this. ��The food is incredible. ��Wow. ��The porkbelly, wildboar sloppy joe, the tuna (i stole food from each of my friends, it looked to good to pass up). ��Holy crap. ��Oh and the coffee I had with my creme brulee. ��It was one of the best roasts I have ever tried. ��Oh yeah and the drinks. ��Super cheap whiskeys. Some as low as $3 a glass. ��You must try this place."
"One of my absolute favorite places in the city to grab a drink and enjoy the atmosphere of a bygone era. ��So classy and lovely yet so comfortable. ��Great little joint. ��Bring your romantical partner, get there early to grab a seat, and enjoy some jazz by candlelight. ��I love dirty gin martinis and this seems like the perfect place to enjoy them!Sure, they may shush during the performances, but this is really a place you come to sit back and enjoy the music. ��There are so many bars where you can go to chat, and I think they do a great job of maintaining the integrity of the place and really making the music the central focus.My fiance and I were here last winter on the coldest night of the year, and it was so cozy and perfect. ��Definitely will return, hopefully sooner than later!"
"I come back here consistantly for so many reasons. 1. BYOB and FULL BAR, which is an excellent offering.2. No reservations, but you can enjoy a drink at Wang' while you wait.3. Sushi rolls are very flavorful, and are a good size/price: Godzilla, Red Dragon, Kani Chung are some of my favorites.4. Hot towel when you are seated adds some class to this sushi place.Overall, great sushi at a moderate price, BYOB, friendly staff...Only downsize, not good for groups over about 6 people."
I really like fifty/50 however if your website says you deliver at 2 on Sundays... Well you should deliver at 2 and not 5. ��Might want to change that. Nothing like getting my hopes up for nothing. Normally I would rate it higher but I'm hungover and I want my food now!
"I love the atmosphere here, very laid back. ��You can hang out, and the waiters won't bug you. ��But, if you expect fast service, this is not the place to go. ��Great sweets and coffee, though!"
The finest meal in the entire 50 states. I ��have no problem waiting hours and hours for the fine treats Doug makes. The Duck fries are my new thing.
"I've eaten and drank here several times and have never had a bad experience. First off, fried cheese curds as an appetizer. Deep fried cheese served w/ranch dressing. How can anyone not order these? If I recall correctly, it's actually a misdemeanor in Wisconsin to not order deep fried cheese when made available to you. For the slightly more cholesterol conscious consumer, there's the mini ham sandwiches appetizer that his the spot with just the right amount of food for two people seeking some pre-meal pork provisions. They also have a goat cheese fondue appetizer that looks amazing and is currently on my to-do list.The menu is very heavily focused on burgers. Another reviewer (and the menu) mentions the burger meat is from Pat La Frieda in NYC, a company that has been in the business over"
"My husband and I ordered delivery from here. it arrived 15 minutes early. hot & fresh! And the food was AMAZING we ate until we were too full, and still had left overs! so much flavor and deliciousness. I look forward to visiting the establishment in person, and we certainly order take out from here again."
"As busy as the were during 2 lunches during our a recent stay, the wait staff was so attentive. ��The venison burger was so good my companion had it twice. ��I had the beet salad which I thoroughly enjoyed and the pear soup - excellent. ��On the second visit, I enjoyed the turkey sandwich, which was very good. ��I wish we could have been there at dinner but we did stop in for a drink at night and again, friendly and prompt staff. ��Drink prices were what we expected and what we pay in NYC."
"This place is fantastic. ��The setting, the staff, the owner. ��But the food is the what keeps me coming back. ��The arugula and proscuitto antipasti is perfect. ��The pizza makes me miss NY just a little bit less each time I go. ��Don't go if you love Chicago's strange interpretation of pizza, the pan pizza. ��This is the real thing."
"I am just starting to get into eating Sushi, and a friend recommended I take this girl here on our first date. ��The atmosphere couldn't have been any better and our waitress was really friendly. ��It's a byob place, so I brought 2 bottles of wine. ��The waitress said that normally they only allow one bottle per person, but opened our second bottle anyway. ��Aside from that, the food was EXCELLENT! ��We started out with a crab cake special and it was really good. ��We ordered 4 different rolls: Maine, Dragon, California, and another one, but I can't remember...must have been that second bottle of wine! ��The Dragon was so good that we had to order another one! ��They were all pretty good, but that was definitely the best. ��If you like crunchy on the inside, just the right spice, and delicious...I "
"Calos' is my favorite neighborhood restaurant. ��Not only are their Italian dishes superb, they have the best ribs in town. ��It's great that the ribs are a special during the week. ��You can't beat the price of the rib dinner, which includes your choice of soup or salad and a side of pasta or potato. ��Top it off with a martini, and I'm in heaven."
I believe that Food and Service are two key ingredients (no pun intended) for a great restaurant experience. Peace lacks in both areas especially the service part. I have been there twice now. The first time we were seated we asked if could order a large pizza w/ 1/2 covered whatever my friend wanted and the other what I wanted. They said not a problem. I asked if we would be charged for half the topping price...and the waiter snapped at me and said he didnt' make the rules. I said ok and we proceeded to order. When we got our pizza it was quite soggy and the toppings were falling off the pizza. I asked if I could have ranch dressing or blue cheese w/ my pizza. Again the waiter snapped and said that they don't have those condiments because the owner doesn't want anyone eating his pizza wit
"I've lived most of my life in Chicago and missed Chicago pizza when I moved out of state. I LOVE Giordano's pizza. HOWEVER, while visiting the Mag Mile I tried to order a pizza without tomato sauce for my child who has a food sensitivity. The manager of the 730 N. Rush street location (Robert) refused to accommodate my 10 year old's disability and was horribly rude in the process including hanging up on my wife. All we asked was for a small thin crust pizza with butter instead of tomato sauce. Not exactly an excessive demand. He could have at least been friendly about the refusal. Gino's East here I come!"
"I LOVE Coast. ��It is by far my very favorite place for sushi. ��And it's BYO --can't ask for much more. ��My husband and I go there at least once a month. ...And with three kids, time together is pretty precious. ��Atmosphere is fantastic and Danny's (small bar around the corner) is a great little place to wait if you can't get your table right away."
"I had so much fun grilling my own food and trying out a wide variety of kimchi even if we don't even know what it is. It could've been better if they label everything, so we know what we're eating. Grilling is fun but make sure you go home after trying out this place because you will definitely smell like smoke.Their soup was awesome. I think they made their miso soup from scratch not like those other Japanese Restaurants who I think just prepares the instant one.Service was just okay. Some of the servers were not fluent and could not understand English very well. I may come back when we have friends from out of town. But, if it was just us...I may not have the craving for their food ever...again."
"My boyfriend and I have been here twice, and we have been very pleased both times. Great service, delicious food, and good atmosphere. The first time we ate in the coach house, and it was great. The second time we ate in the main room, and it was lively and bright. It's a little expensive, but definitely worth it."
"I ate there on a Friday, when most people were at work, so I didn't have to wait, but every time I past by the place there are always a ton of people waiting outside. I would not wait in that long of a line. I love the airplane fans and the veggie sand which I had was good."
Solid breakfast there again last week. ��This place has been going strong for years and i think is a totally comfortable enjoyable place to hang and catch up with friends or the newspaper. ��I had a really great Cobb Salad and my lady had a great omelette. ��Solid!
"I was eating a lot at Reza's and after some ppl told me about this spot, I decided to check it out for my birthday last year.Food wasnt that great and it didnt seem fresh. Service was average, nothing great. I rather go to the other places in Albany Park."
"I came here about 5 times and the food is always consistent. ��It's not the best cuban food I've ever had but there's not much to compare it to besides my friend's mom's cooking. ��I love the atmosphere. ��They have an outdoor patio that is perfect during the summer and good service. ��For appetizers, I always get plantain chips and the congris rice. ��It is sooooo good. ��The congris rice has bits of bacon in it which is like a little heaven in your mouth. ��Then for my meal I get the bistec sandwich it's good but sometimes it can be a bit sloppy. ��Oh and don't forget to get a pitcher of sangria! ��It's a nice complement to any meal there!"
"Went on a Saturday night, around 8pm, and it was SO packed. The tables are really close together, and when it's full it's almost impossible to get around. Love the BYOB. Had to ask at least twice for wine glasses though after we sat down. We had a fresh veggie roll and a veggie egg roll for apps and it was good. I had a chicken dish with jalapenos, peppers, and a decent sauce. Most everyone enjoyed their entrees. Reasonably priced. I would recommend reservations if you go on a weekend night."
"This place is really good and I highly recommend going there at least once. The menu is amazing. Do try their Ropa Vieja - it is absolutely delicious. I also had the Bistek Palomilla and if you're a meat lover, this is as good as it gets. The decor is so vibrant and happy that it is worth going to Carnivale just for the atmosphere. The only negative is that it is not easy on the wallet. I usually would not spend that much on a meal, but it was definitely worth trying."
what can i say that the others have not said...really great hot dougs ;]
"Awesome beer Menu! There were tons of beers I had never even heard of, which to me was impressive. I loved the staff and the look of the place. Great location too. Burgers were super tasty, love eggs on the burgers!"
overpriced ...nothing special about the dog ... goto gene and judes for half the price and better dog
"New years day, my family and I wanted to try something new, so we pop up on yelp and see the great reviews for this place, so we decided to try it. The Place was packed and understandable so we made a reservation and explored the area while we were waiting to be called, so we're in the gift shop across the street when the manager comes yelling in at us for not picking up the phone, so they sent us upstairs where we stood outside in the cold while no one came ��to open the door for us until a nice customer of the restaurant had to stand up from his seat to open it for us. So the waiter look baffled as we walk in like we didn't belong there, Then after he guides us to our seats, We sit for a long period of time before they brought us our menus lol. Now that was just what we saw in their servi"
"The wings were definitely not crisp, they were soggy and the sauce was completely generic. ��The guys behind the counter were also eating the whole time and talking to customers with their mouths full. ��If the trend is 'bad', this place could be called trendy."
"Went for lunch during the week. The lunch menu offers reasonable prices. ��Wait staff was attentive, but can be slow due to the lunch hour rush. Other than that salad and chicken were fresh and flavorful!"
"I have been coming to the Green Mill for more than 20 years and it hasn't lost one step in the quality of the music, the vibe of the space or strength of the pour ;). ��Thanks Green Mill!"
This Southern American place really hits the spot!Their grits are awesome I get them every time I go. ��The breakfast is decent but I personally like coming here for dinner much more.I love the atmosphere; I happen to stumble in one evening when there was a live band and they were just fantastic!
"They serve a decent selection of beer on tap and bottled. Service was more of a sports bar attitude and not a dining institution. ��Regardless, the food is good and service is not bad. ��It is a good go-to spot for late night pig outs on those weekends where you kinda want to drink a little and eat but can't decide where to go."
"Man, I'm surprised how many ""nasty attitude"" comments there are. I come here a lot and never once been met with anything other than super helpful people. This is one of those places that I have a hard time venturing outside of the box, because inside the box is filled with insanely delish macarons. I know there are sticklers for these little gems, but even a bad macaron isn't really bad. But, when they're good, its sort of mind blowing.The rose flavor. OH SWEET HEAVENS! Floral notes in pastry can often be overwhelming and perfumey, but this one teeters on the edge. Its SO fragrant in your mouth, its hard to explain.I wish I lived closer so I could sample more of their creations. So far just macarons, those domes that look like boobs, and a few others that escape my mind but not my taste bu"
"So much better than any tapas restaurant in Chicago! ��Excellent ambiance, the Sangria rocked (I used to make my own in the 60's-70's) and the menu is full of perfect little creations to fill you up.Went here 3 nights in a row but during the week, stayed at the Hilton nextdoor & went to Bluesfest'09. ��Saw this place packed on the weekend so stayed away. Definitely go during the week. ��You will probably see some celebrities here. ��Sit at the little bar if you go alone.All the waitstaff are friendly & fun & goodlooking too!"
"I would not give out a 5 star review if this place didn't deserve it. I have had most of the menu, almost everything was simply perfect. By far, the best crab legs I have ever had, and at a fraction of fine dinning prices. For the reviewers that think that Glenn's is pricy, go to Denny's if you want breakfast for 5 bucks. ��I would suggest you go at least once for brunch, once for lunch , and a few times for dinner, all the fish is amazing, the scallops with that mushroom sherry cream sauce is like sex. Share a few apps, I recomend the shrimp cargo: shrimp in a dish of garlic butter w cheese melted over the top, and the mussels. The soups are very good as well."
"I stopped in for the first time for a late Saturday lunch. The place was comfortably full, but my young daughter and I were seated promptly in a booth in the side section. The space was more kid-friendly that I expected - it's a sports bar atmosphere with music, but not unbearably loud, at least not during the late lunch hour when we visited. I tried the oatmeal stout beer and liked it very much. So far so good. We ordered a plain style pizza (which means it has parmesan but not mozzarella cheese). After a longish wait (20-30? minutes) our pizza arrived with the crust looking plainly overcooked. Our server managed not to notice or care. The crust was hard enough that cutting it with a knife and fork for my daughter was a real challenge. It's hard to factor out this rather essential failing"
"Best chicken wings!So unique flavor wings!Their spicy wing and sweet wing, both were excellent.I can not tell which ones better. You can order half and half. I tasted the limit of crispy chicken wings I never had before.Food was the best, but I give 4 stars, because the tables and the floors were not cleaned. Maybe so many customers there."
"This is by far my favorite Brazilian BBQ restaurant in Chicago. The salad bar is simply put, AMAZING. There are so many choices, including sushi, that the other two Brazilian BBQ restaurants in the city do not have. ��In addition to the meats there's also grilled pineapple and shrimp. At first when the waiter was introducing the pineapple to us I was thinking ""no way am I going to waste my stomach space on fruit, I'm here to eat the meats"" but boy was I wrong. The pineapple is delicious. I came here December 2011 for my birthday and wanted to go back a couple months later but the restaurant closed due to a fire in the building according to their website. I was so sad but wanted Brazilian BBQ so bad that my hubby and I tried Texas de Brazil and was not satisfied. A month later we tried Fogo "
"I can't say enough about this place. ��AMAZING!!!! ��Doug is awesome, along with all his encased meats."
excellent food and service. ��the vegetarian chili is sublime!
yes...BAM! super bright green relish!super fun super fast drive in ordersuper busyit's superdawg!
"Sappori is my boyfriend and mine's favorite spot in the city. ��We are here all the time, usually later in the evening, and regardless if it's a Tuesday or a busy Friday night, the service is always accomodating and pleasurable. ��The bread is exactly what you want at an Italian place: warm, crusty on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside.The menu is always changing, from the wine to the specials. ��Whereas my boyfriend can't get over the Spaghetti or seafood ravioli, which are staples, I always tend to order the rotating dishes and always enjoy them.And to back up the other reviews, the tiramisu here is the best I've ever had, and perfect for two people to share :)"
"And yes, same thing! service was terrible... and the meat was so salty at, had to tell the server to go a bit easy. I don't know, i feel this place is losing its touch."
"I just moved to the neighborhood and everyone kept asking me if i had tried 3rd coast yet. So today i had some reading to get done before my night class and figured i would try it. I had lox on a bagel, which my inner new yorker has been searching for ever since i moved here. It was lovely. Bottomless coffee is always a plus. It wasn't too busy, so it was nice and quiet.. but seemed to be full of regulars, which is always a good sign. Everyone was so nice and when they heard i was there new neighbor was more than welcoming. I sat there for about two hours drinking coffee and reading. They played really good music. I even had to iphone shazam some of it. everyone there was so nice. i'll be back there, maybe even tomorrow!"
"I really like these dogs, always a wait but also worth the wait. I usually bring out of towners here."
"great beer selection, house beer menu is varied and quite competentive. Valet or more parking solutions would definetely improve the experience. Service is well maintained in their peak hours,( my first visit was on a Saturday night). Great decor, beautiful wood used in the bar. Great place, will definetely come back"
"back again, server was not that good at all.food was AA+ like always.just the service was really bad.i am not going to put a name on here (although i almost want to)but sometimes you will get a bad server, that is the nature of going to restaurants.but hopefully next time, we do not get this one."
I love Violet Hour. ��Fantastic drinks and sexy cool vibe. ��Defiantly date night spot!! ��Some advice though...these drinks are STRONG so a couple will do you nicely. ��Consider yourself warned.
"This place had great food, amazing service, and was overall the perfect place for my BBQ-loving husband's birthday. A lot of people have commented about the price of the food. While this place is priced higher than many BBQ places, you also will never find the kind of service that Chicago Q offers at any of those places. (I also doubt you could find flights of single barrel whiskeys at any other BBQ place--a huge hit with my husband and I). This place is definitely worth checking out."
"My family has been going to Sabatino's for years. It's such a family favorite that my wife chose to go to Sabatino's for her 50th birthday (we brought our two daughters, who were 8 and 11 at the time). We love this place -- the food is usually great, the service is usually great ��it's on a par with or better than much more expensive places that are located downtown. The night we went, the service was unbelievably bad. We could hardly believe it was the same place. Where to start? First of all, we were there for 2 hours and 45 minutes -- far too long for any dinner (yeah, that could be us, but we've never spent more than an hour-and-a-half in a restaurant). Two of the main courses were overcooked. The waiter and staff were very slow in clearing the table. I asked for a spicy Bloody Mary -- "
"I went here a few years back, and I can still remember the delicious bite of Gino's pizza. There's none other like itThis is the place to go for deep dish pizza!"
"This place is absolutely amazing. Food, service, and atmosphere- all great! Such a creative menu and great prices too. one plate of food could probably feed two people though"
"This is a good place for a variety of Cuban sandwiches. In addition, the Tostones were almost as big as a DVD and very tasty! The only downside is the limited seating. If you want a table, go on a warm day and sit outside."
This is the Best Place to find the organic produceI enjoyed their natural fruit juices in the past too.
"Loved Frontera Grill!!! ��My husband and I went with another couple to celebrate a Birthday, and we had a fantastic time. ��We made the reservation several months in advance, and it was well worth it. ��We walked in, and they took us right to our table. ��There were so many fantastic choices on the menu, so we asked the server for recommendations. ��We started with guacamole for the table. ��It was the best guacamole I have ever eaten, and I've had lots of guacamole. ��I read a few reviews that said they'd skip the guacamole for that price tag, but I totally disagree!! ��The avocados were so perfect and creamy! ��Our server suggested the Special that night which was Cochinita Pibil, a pork dish. ��It was so yummy!!! ��I wanted to lick the plate clean. ��It came with habanero salsa, which was the spici"
Best place to get chicken and the buddah bowls are delicious.If your hungry this is the place to go. GReat freakin food..
"I'm done with the Hopleaf forever. ��I've been here a bunch of times over the years, and I'm done. ��Here are the reasons why:1) ��Its just too damn busy to be worth it, go buy some good beer and hang out with friends at home instead. ��If you're a 20 something kid that just starting going out legally to bars then you'd be into this place. �� 2) I ordered an Aventinus once. ��I know how to pronounce it, I speak Latin (just look at my name), not to mentioned I've had that beer more than once before. ��The bartender corrected me, despite being wrong - he also, to me, sounded and acted like an ignorant jackass.3) Bartenders and staff having personal conversations is more important than serving customers. ��This has happened every single time I've been here. ��4) Let's talk about the food. ��It can be r"
"I have been coming here for well, I won't tell you the years but the Kalbi price on the menu was 10.95 per order when I started coming here. ��To me this is the best and most authentic Korean food in Chicago, barnone! ��I know because I used to live there. ��I've been to solga, cho sun ok, hae woon dae due to others recommendations and its no comparison. ��Those other places are watered down Korean. ��The flavor is not the authentic flavor I've had. ��Love the fact that they burn the wooden charcoal in lieu of gas grill as there is distinct flavor difference. ��However, the novelty of grilling has worn off, I no longer cook here. ��I tell my dining companions ahead of time, listen ��this ain't my first tango so you cook EVERYTHING if you wanna use the grill, otherwise, I am perferctly happy letting"
"The line is long, but it is totally worth it! ��With prices so low on such high quality food, it is no wonder people will stand in line. ��Three of us shared three courses and all got our own hot cocos for $15 a person. ��Not only do they have great chocolate everything, but it is the only chocolate without perspectives in Chicago."
"I've been going to Hop Leaf since the early 90's and have always considered it to be one of the best beer bars in the city. The place is sooo jammed anymore you really have to pick and choose your times to go. As with the other posters, I agree with their assessment about the staff, particularly the bartenders. I don't know what is with the service industry attitude anymore, I can deal with funny, sarcastic humor, but there is no room for bartenders to be condescending and snide, which is usually the case at Hop Leaf, unless you happen to be a regular, so I have found more friendly, better suited places to take my business."
"You have the Uno people, the Giordano's people, and then you have the few that know about ��the Art of Pizza. I have not met one person (who has tried this stuff) that didn't like it. Great deep dish!"
"Loved this place! ��Great atmosphere, amazing waitstaff and very unique menu.My husband loved the venison burger and my daughter enjoyed her chicken dish very muchI am a vegetarian and while I love eating out, I pretty much know I'm going to have a pasta dish or salad when we go out. ��The Gage offered two great vegetarian choices, and I ended up with a very interesting cabbage roll along side an interesting fennel sauce. I know this is not a mainstream choice, but I really appreciated having such a different dish offered! ��I didn't eat a lot of the cabbage (it was very good, but i was getting full after appetizers and a salad plus we had ordered their huge bowl of fries for the table.) Another waitperson (other than our fantastic waitress) came over to make sure that I was enjoying my meal "
The best beer selection in the city. ��Great decor- ��awesome now that you have a choice to sit in the back where its less crowded!!! �� the food is good- kind of a strange menu though. �� Mainly its an awesome place to try new beers and hang with friends. ��A very eclectic mix of people go here- which is a nice change from the normal frat boy pub...
I had a seafood calamari salad and it was exquisite not to mention their pizza and pastas! They also deliver and the servers are quite kind.I rave about this restaurant to my friends all the time!They have a variety of dishes from chicken to seafood and pasta...you just can't go wrong!
"I can never go back after seeing how some of the wait staff handled the food before serving it to the customer. ��I was sickened as I saw hands touching the food on the plate because the food was sliding a ��little off the plate. ��Overall, the restaurant is in need of some remodeling and it doesn't look ��clean at all. ��Cleanliness is my number 1 priority when going to a restaurant but apparently it isn't theirs. �� If I could give it no stars I would. ��The food was bad too. ��Let's just say the rest of the evening was not pleasant to say the least."
"5 stars is compared to other restaurants in this price bracket. ?Not the same category as Bon Soiree, Schwa, or Alinea.The lunch specials are insanely cheap (I think they're all under $10) and include salad, spring roll, rice, and a drink. ?And so so so delicious. ?I have yet to try anything I don't like on the menu... although the chicken soup is a bit standard (not a bad thing, I just like my food a little weird).Delivery is great - you often get a little extra treat with your order - fresh fresh fruit (no half assed fruit salad), some fried rice, etc. ?The owner is a treat to talk to over the phone, and delivery wait time is reasonable. ?Everything arrives hot, packaged separately when needed.Dining in is fantastic - it's BYOB and I hear they have some insane deal on a multi-course meal"
"BYOB!! ��Also, the service is incredible -- the staff is very welcoming and attentive! ��Their bubble teas and smoothies are fantastic. ��Tasty fresh fruit and perfect tapioca bubbles. ��Also, they can make their smootheis/bubble teas w/o added sugar for those who prefer a stronger fruit taste. ��FISHERMAN'S SOUP is INCREDIBLE!!! ��:) ��The pho is great, the bahn sandwiches are great, the crepes/pancakes are great, the fried bananas and ice cream are delicious ... on and on. �� It's great for groups and parties."
"Everything I ate, drank and saw at this restaurant was hands down amazing. I would go back anytime. I loved the vibe and the food was awesome. It wasn't even that expensive for being such a great restaurant. I recommend!!"
"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this sushi restaurant when we were looking for a good BYOB place in my new neighborhood. ��This is by far the BEST sushi I have ever had! ��The Sashimi is so fresh that it melts in your mouth. ��The prices are a little higher than other local sushi bars, but they are still reasonable and it is worth every penny!The staff is very attentive and friendly. ��The atmosphere is great...the music is VERY loud, but surprisingly, it works. ��The music helps drown out those sitting next to you, providing a surprisingly intimate dining experience."
My favorite veggie burrito anywhere! Lots of vegetarian options and a delicious oatmeal shake! I crave Irazu all the time and want to try everything on the menu. BYOB is a huge plus.
rite off da brown line makes it so convenient fo a college kid lyk me!!!warm chips with salsa and an order of the torta dinner fills up my hungry appetite. Ive come in 5 times in da last month and each time is always grate!sometimes theyyr service kinda slow but food is always good!
well above average Vietnamese & noodle. service was fantastic. I had vegetable egg rolls and King crab pasta ��both very good.
"I visited here once and oddly- we were one of only three tables eating in the dining room- much to my surprise. ��Likely this was due to the snow storm that night- in fact we were there because our flight to PHX was canx so we had an unexpected night at home...anyway I was so eager to try this place. ��It came so highly recommended- from friends who I consider real foodies, but alas I was pretty disappointed. ��The pizza's are fine but nothing I would go back for...and I HAVE been to Italy to eat the real thing. ��I would definitely be willing to give it another shot but currently I am less than impressed."
Recently had a chance to experience this place and I fell in love. I felt as if I had gone back in time to a 1920's atmosphere but with a dash of modern chic. The dim lighting accented the fabulous light fixtures that culminated in the chandelier centerpiece on the first floor. I was lucky to catch some live music the night I went which was reminiscent of old school New orleans. On the second floor there is a quaint speakeasy that just adds to the laid back smooth vibe you get when you come here. The drinks were great but I plan on coming back to try the food which I hear is equally as great.
"The food here is wonderful, and the interior is sleek and beautiful. ?I'm giving the restaurant 3 stars based on my carryout experience.I usually stop here as an indulgence a couple of times a month on my way to work, before 8 AM. ?I've ordered about half the menu, and carrier it out, and the food has always been fantastic. ?My husband and I are long-time fans of Rick Bayless' fine dining restaurants, and the food at XOCO tastes every bit as good as (though it's different than) the dishes served next door.However, if you are visitng the restaurant, I really strongly recommend that you dine in. ?Honestly, I don't think that they know how to do carry out that well. ?They offer one size container, and a plastic bag, and they packed my breakfast special this morning in 3 separate containers (c"
"I love their oatmeal with cherries! ��It has been awhile since I have eaten there. ��My one complaint -- ��it can get very noisy and crowded, especially during the weekend."
"Everytime my family comes out to visit we always try a new restaurant downtown and most recently we tried Piccolo Sogno. I loved everything about this restaurant. The service was the great, the bartender was very nice, and the food was amazing. I defnitely recommend this restaurant if our looking for a more expensive, but amazing italian dinner."
brian...if you are that upset why don't you call the owner and tell him what happened
"I just tried this place with my friends last night and it was absolutely amazing!!!!Avocado Wontons, tamarind shrimp soup, and the ginger mahi mahi all were scrumptious! To top it all off, I ordered a vietnamese hot coffee at the end of my meal. Seriously, this stuff is fierce!all the ingredients were fresh, service was very attentive, atmosphere was very nice and they gave us little complimentary fruit plates at the end of our meal. There's no way I'm going back to argyle for my vietnamese-fix after trying this new place! five stars!"
"Such a great place for a fresh food when you're on a budget. ��I'm glad they expanded their outdoor seating because it's almost always busy. ��But even when that's the case, staff and owners are friendly and the food comes out decently fast. ��Plus it's consistent - sandwiches are always good, as is the traditional meal plates. ��My favorites include the palm salad and the sweet plantains."
One of Chicago's greatest Brunch Spots. ��Wait staff is a little annoying therefore I subtracted a star
"I admit it, I ordered a carry out and all I got was the Sweet Potatoes. ��I sat ��in front of my TV, and polished off every single bite. ��I was tempted to lick the container (OK, I DID lick the container). ��This has to be one of the most highly addictive dishes out there. ��I don't even want to imagine the number of calories I just consumed.....I'll be working out an extra hour tomorrow (maybe two extra hours and then I can order them again)."
I am a fan of Middle eastern food thanks to Pita Inn. I wanted to try out a Persian restaurant this time and I have heard of Noon O Kabab. I found out there is a difference between Persian and Middle eastern food. The food was awesome. I ordered a skewer of chicken and kabaab. The hummus was good as well. I would definitely come back here when I am in the mood for some Persian cuisine.
"I have been coming here for years - and the food never disappoints. ��From the pizza to the ribs, there is always a fantastic experience. ��Attentive staff, wonderful decor, and just a cozy feeling. ��I love this place even more ever since they redecorated - this little gem in Andersonville is well hidden, and off the beaten path - but it is well worth the trip!"
"I love, love, love BIN 36! ��Hands down the best Cheese and Wine in the city- and the other food ain't bad either. ��I eat at the bar mostly, it's comfortable and inviting and the bartenders are very friendly, I would definitely recommend it to single diners. ��I've also been to the Movies in the Loft and it's a blast. ��Try the Bin 36 Cheese flight and the Red Hot South America Wine Flight or the Well Traveled Whites- all my favorites."
"Great food! great ambiance! Great owner! Love the waitresses! Not to mention, the Green Mill is across the street. My only complaint is that the food isn't cooked by ethiopians. This, however, will not bother most americans because they won't know the difference."
Best dogs. ��Call in advance to pick up your dogs. ��My favorite is the Thai dog. I love this place.
"First of all just the decor alone is enough to love this place, the Jlo top they have framed to the sexy Gwen Stefani pic in the men's bathroom. But going to what's important the food and service well all I have to says awesome awesome awesome ,fresh and spectacular ,the mojitos are great and overall the ambient is wonderful sexy and date ready or for a night of sexy salsa dancing on their bar side. Kudos to the awesome cooks and chef..."
This place is great. ��We celebrated my birthday here this February and everything was perfect. ��The food and the service was spectacular.
Pizza was ok but really bland. Maybe I'll try it again down the road...but I'm in no hurry.
"Spacca Napoli is consistently fresh & delicious.I'm especially fond of the margherita pizza & house salad.Service is friendly & quick, but can be a bit pushy during peak times. I'd definitely recommend sitting on the outside patio with a glass of wine = )"
This is Chicago pizza. ��If you are looking for the best pizza in town - this is it! ��The End.
"Went there after meeting the owner at a River North event and was very impressed. ��First, the valet parking is easy, and there was a valet there waiting for a customer to pull up. ��Manager at the door greeting me (I was dining with a baby), and he made sure to place us in a spot with easy access where we would not be in anyone's way. ��Service was great, and no dirty looks from the staff (those with babies will know what I'm talking about) when we needed more napkins or apple juice. ��I ordered a Porterhouse, which was great. ��But order it less cooked then you would like. ��I like medium rare but ordered rare and it was perfect.I really like eating at a River North/Downtown restaurant with good food where I don't feel I overpaid, and this place fit the ticket."
This place was very delicious! The food had a lot of flavor and the employees were very friendly. They were a bit slow but I think they worked all day and were exhausted. We went at 9pm. The food was absolutely ��excellent!The bathroom did need to be better maintained with paper towel and toilet paper.
"Best cocktails in town! go there super casual/hipster or dress up for an expensive date. Regardless, their whiskey menu alone is worth the trip."
"Amazing little spot for a great meal. We went there for lunch on Monday. We had the butternut squash and spinach lasagna, brussel sprout and sundried tomato salad, veggie chili over polenta and sweet potatoes, and a BLT with potato-garlic soup. The food was all fresh and delicious. Each of the dishes were flavour-filled, and generous portions. Highly recommend this place!"
"We made a reservation the week before, received emails and a call to confirm, but we arrived and still waited 10-15 minutes. We found that the restaurant was VERY loud as our party of four was given a table in the center of the restaurant. Waiters and people bumped into our chairs the whole evening, which was very frustrating and distracting. The food was wonderful - I recommend the cheese ravioli, my husband was less than thrilled with the tomato based pasta dish. It was so loud we couldn't hear the waiter and he was not very helpful anyway. I thought it was a delicious. I had the panna cotta dessert was pretty good, not great."
"Geja's ambiance and food are a great combination. Despite the fact that you are cooking your own food, the meats and vegetables were fresh and flavorful. They have an extensive wine list, and an attentive staff. In comparison to The Meltingpot (another fondue destination), Gejas was superior. The menu does not have as many choices, but the dishes were simple and delicious. The chocolate fondue was also served flambeed. Yum! Great date destination"
Well it is not indian indian.... but pretty neat ambience
Large portions of bad food. ��Pasta swimming in watery sauce. ��Sauces lacked any imagination. ��Service was sloooowwww!! ��Drinks were weak. ��Overpriced for the quality.
"Yes, you're going to have to most likely wait to sit down. That's because this place is so popular. If you're wanting to eat quicker, yet don't want to take your meal to go and are willing to stand up while you eat, get your food to go, then just take it to the little counter next to the door. No one will question you and you can watch everyone you were just standing in line with wait for another 30 minutes. The food itself? Absolutely high quality. It's Rick Bayless. Top Chef Masters Champion, and you can eat at one of his restaurants for under $15 bucks. I'm not a big hot chocolate fan, but the blend they make here is great. You honestly can't go wrong with anything."
"I love this place. Consistently great food and an upbeat staff. Not sure what the guy meant about dead eyed , huffer waiter Okayy...yet he has been there several times?? Hmm sounds like he is giving bad vibes and the staff probably draws straws to wait on him and this waiter drew the shortest straw...I like the vibe and the waitstaff is always freindly and go out of their way....but that is just me...So this is a top choice for good prices and a fun place!!"
Best Korean BBQ in town and they also have very good appetizers.
this place is awesome! i know how to speak some of the lang but i'm just not confident enough to talk to a native korean speaker. the reason i said this because if you don't know how to speak the lang they might not help you much. when i was there our waitress never came back to us to see if we were doing ok til i ��call them in the lang and another lady pretty much helped us ... the food are great & so as the banchan.. i guess to make it short the things i don't like about this place is #1. the parking #2. the service & last but not the least you'll smell like bbq when you leave! but overall it's a nice place to eat & i would go back whenever i get a chance.
"All I have to say is: Milanesa Sandwich (the sauce is so amazing and what definitely differentiates the sandwich from a typical torta), Chips & Guacamole (both fresh!), and Oatmeal Shake (need I say more?). The only three things you need to be happy in life! Their Horchatas are really good, too.This place is super casual and very, very inexpensive - two people can eat for under $25, for sure. It's basically a fast food restaurant, except with a waiter. Their entire seating area is technically outdoors, too. It's one of those things you'd have to see yourself to figure it out... I'm really not sure how it works in the winter.....Overall, I really love the food, the atmosphere is pretty weird, and I'm not at all a fan of their Cash Only policy, even if they have an ATM on hand."
"What to say about Alinea? A dinner at Alinea is an intense journey through a world of flavor, texture, and truly artistic presentation. Chef Grant blends flavors in ways you could never imagine. In this process he often creates a dish so unique, so beautiful you almost hate to consume it and would rather simply ponder the complexities of something that is, in essence, nothing more than fuel for your body. Chef G takes a lot of risks with his food. Some are absolutely triumphant. Hot Potato/Cold Potato and the Ravioli Explosion were both courses highlighting the unparalleled decadence of black truffle (other than maybe white truffle). Also a cold foie gras/crabapple morsel blew my mind. But as stunning as Chef G is in his successes he was equally abysmal (albeit only 2 out of 25 courses) in"
Something about this mexican food gets me! ��I think it is one of the best in Chicago. ��Great food! ��I will definitely be ordering from here more often.
"I have lived in this area since 2002 and just discovered this place in July 2011, so yeah, I would not be the person to describe as hip, slick and cool, but I am one that people would say knows good food. Chicago Diner is one of the best veg places that I have been to. The menu is unique and changes, the staff is attentive and I always leave feeling pretty damn satistified from my meal and how many other vegetarian places can boast that? I had been ordering a Reuben without the corned beef for quite a while and was pretty sick of the extra cheese or sauerkraut that well-meaning eateries would pile on...I had even started to not be bothered when eateries would say Well..it will just be cheese, sauerkraut and bread when I asked for them to leave off the corned beef...going to Chicago Diner m"
"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place. ��On weekend nights there is usually a wait. ��Order a couple Mojitos (the best I've had) at the bar and you will be good to go. ��The butter they serve with the bread is fantastic. ��I would recommend the Honey Jalapeno Pork chops with sweet potatoes. ��You get two HUGE pork chops (lots of fat, but that adds to the flavor) for a decent price. ��The service can be a little lacking, and it can get a little loud. ��However I still love it. ��After reading some reviews I will have to try brunch."
"Love their Chinese BBQs....the chicken very tender...the honey BBQ pork is also very tasty...can't say the same about other dishes.Service is un organized, at times chaotic, the waiter brought us the wrong without any apologies.Will try their Peking duct on our next visit."
"I had been hearing about Piece for quite a long time, and was excited to visit last Friday for good beer and pizza with my girlfriend. Fully aware of what the atmosphere would be like, we were excited to go for beers and pizza before we headed out for the night. After a reasonable wait, we were seated at a high top table near the bar. My girlfriend and I enjoyed the atmosphere, and were already talking about how we can't wait to take our friends there in the future. Also, we found it amusing to watch some of the more inebriated patrons socializing.... Unfortunately, one of those drunk patrons began to cause a ruckus. Long story short, the staff at Piece eventually handled the situation with delicacy and poise.We were unable to finish our meal that night, but are looking forward to giving P"
"This place serves up great delicious duck fat fries and gourmet dogs. ��My favorite is game of the week, but every dog I've tried has been delicious! ��The dogs are all served on the standard bun but it works well. ��I'm only giving this four stars because of the hours and insanely long wait. ��You may also have to wait for a table due to the crowd. ��Highly recommend this for the food though."
"The crab cakes, the salmon, the sole, the bread and what more can I say? ��My favorite mid western seafood restaurant - all so very fresh and delectableOh yes, how about the fabulous martinis !"
"I just ate here for the first time and the burrito was amazing. ��The steak was so well marinated that you didn't need anything else. �� I know that this is authentic mexican which is hard to find, but a taco sauce may help!"
Classic place! ��The food and service is old school and delicious. ��We go here for lunch meetings and are always pleased.
"I am really not a fan of waiting in lines. Not at movies, not on roller coasters, not for bars, and certainly not for pancakes. I have waited in the line just to say that I have and to see what the fuss is about. The breakfast was about as good as it can be but its just breakfast food. The decor is pretty typical Wicker Park decor. The staff is soso the good being friendliness and effort. The bad being they seem a little overwhelmed sometimes. (Forgetting stuff)"
"Been going to their Wicker Park location for years. ��Quick, fresh and tasty. ��Love the expanded seating space, as well as the wallet-friendly prices."
"Wow !!!!!!!!!!!! Davanti Enoteca is incredible. I remember when you could not walk down this street. Now it is safe and has incredible restaurants like Davanti. Davanti, has a great atmosphere, very friendly knowledgeable staff. The food was great & the wine was even better. Good thing we all took cabs. The amazing thing was the bill. We thought that there was something wrong. That it was way too low for all that we had. We pointed it out to our waiter. It took him awhile to process it. I guess he has not been wracked with the difficult complaint of customers being concerned about being undercharge. He took the check away with him and returned with a satisfied look on his face. Yes the bill was correct and we were not being undercharged. Since we wrongly accused our fine waiter friend of u"
Seafood Salad? ��Yes sir!1/2 off oysters deal is tempting to...
Delicious! We were immediately accomodated at the sushi bar. Great food and service and prices were actually not too steep!
"Beer = A+Pizza = A+Service = A (the place is so busy it can't be perfect)If you haven't already been to Piece, go, soon, do it."
this place is something special the food is really tasty ��and the staff is really friendly. I especiallyrecommend the lobster ravioli and the fried calamari they are to die for. The decor is simple but cozy i definitely recommend it not only for the food but the waiters are really good looking not to mention the owner Elio.
"I should have know that this place was going to be CHESSE when I looked at their website. You've gotta trust your gut.""Hey -- let's go to a place that's designed like a jail and has food that tastes like a prison cafeteria! ��And, let's get charged for it! "" What were we thinking!Oh well."
"Wedding guests generally don't comment on the cake, right? ��It's usually fine, but it's rarely something special. ��Well, we got our wedding cake from Alliance Bakery, and according to many of our guests, it was delicious! ��We selected a chocolate cake with an apricot preserve filling, and the cake was a huge hit.Plus, Alliance's wedding cake prices were reasonable, and their staff was easy to work with. ��Done and done."
I love the thin crust pizza at Piece- it's one of my favorites! Great atmosphere and always a good time whether you are actually coming for pizza or just to grab some beer while you watch a game.
"My mother and I make it a point to try new restaurants in the city all the time, and we saved Tru for our birthday celebrations (we both have birthdays in April and we tend to celebrate all month long.) ?The service was outstanding, the staff is extremely educated on both wine, and preparation techniques of the food. ?If this review was based on the service alone it would easily be 5 stars. ?Unfortunately, the driving force behind why I love to eat out is not the service, it's because I love great food. ?Personally, I feel there is a fine line between tasty and trendy. ?All to often fancy restaurants depart from the culinary basics in favor of more experimental and trendy preparation techniques. ?Tru has fallen victim to trendiness overpowering tastiness. ?Three items during out meal reall"
Great pizza and close to Webster movie theatre. ��A perfect combo!
"Although the food is great, I have to give this place two stars for their rude and inconsistent service. ��It is really too bad, the food really is good but there are comparable places not too far away that are attentive and gracious."
"LOVE the live band karaoke--makes for an upbeat vibe. ��Great draft beers. �� I've been here twice, which means two memorable, super fun nights!"
I go swing dancing at the Green mill every thursday. It is best to come before the 2nd set. The dancing is a lot of fun but after the first set it gets mighty crowded. The music can be repetitive but I go more for the atmosphere than anything else. Great place to bring parents 50+
"Went here for my birthday this week...in a word: terrific. A demure and unassuming storefront from the street belies a very intimate little restaurant with simple yet elegant decor. Our waiter (who may have been the chef) was incredibly friendly and attentive all night. We had the grand (7 course) tasting menu and I loved every one. Highlights included braised rabbit paired with very tender gnocchi and vension with a black currant salsa. I wish they offered a wine list but I didnt mind bringing a special bottle of beaujolais I had been saving. All in all an excellent dining experience, and I plan on visiting again soon."
"Love, love, love the Chicken and waffles! Will defiantly return again on my next visit to Chicago."
My fav Italian restaurant in the city. ��Huge portions for great prices. ��Wonderful service. ��Amazing food. ��Love.
"This place is a meat lovers paradise! ��I normally try to go for lunch since it's half price. ��I steer clear of the chicken (not that its bad, but I'm there for steak). ��Their salad bar has a huge selection for you to choose from, unlike any other I've ever seen. ��Everything is really good especially the lamb chops. ��Just writing about it makes me want to ditch work and go downtown!!!! ��Very, very good and the service is exceptional!"
"I recently moved into this neighborhood from California. IT IS ABSOLUTELY A NEIGHBORHOOD GEM. the night I came into the restaurant was pretty quiet. The service was attentive, my appetizer of shrimp tempura came quickly. My main course of coconut mango beef came out and I was absolutely stunned by how amazing it looked. Also tasted delicious!I also got some very tasty oranges and rice cookies at the end of my meal.I must say, this is definitely a food diverse neighborhood and I'm loving every minute of it!"
The quality of customer service is beyond exceptional. ��Arriving here is like arriving at some of the worlds finest hotels and checking in. ��They make you feel wanted and welcome. ��The staff know their wares very well. ��They are passionate about great steaks and it comes shining through. ��You really feel like a guest in someones home. �� And the cherry on the top came after they called me the next day to thank me for having dinner there the night before. ��Very cool experience. ��Its worth every penny.
"I love the skirt steak!!! It's the best so far I had in Chicago. I also tried the drink Raspberry Mojito, ��it's good but not the best, I don't understand tho why it says $9 on the menu but was charge $10 on the bill....I like the cozy atmosphere, very cool art design, they have a small private room on the way to restroom, it's interesting. The service is just okay."
"Beef lollipops tasted a bit gamey, not steak qualityThe noodles for the pancit was all wrong; should really use the rice noodles; it was like eating at china chef!Loompya- isn't this incorrect spelling? shouldn't it be lumpia.bad service-soup came out after our meal, and definitely after we asked for our bill. We actually asked the same waiter for to go boxes, which he brought, and then brought us the soups (really). and then they said they would take them off the bill which they were not, and corrected later-The bus boy spilled soy sauce on my brothers camera.-The sushi chefs were not wearing gloves prepping the food, nor were they washing their hands after touching nonfood items. We were seated within a minute or our arrival, only thing going for this place, but we did have reservations."
"I have been to multiple locations, each one is consistently great. Their menu is extensive and they have a buffet style set-up. I have never eaten anything I didn't enjoy here, but their falafel is what keeps me coming back so much. It is the best falafel I have ever eaten. Their food is always extremely fast, fresh, and cheap. The only downside to this restaurant is that they only accept cash."
"Went with a large group last night and had a good experience. What a selection of craft brews at great prices, food was solid although I wish had a burger instead of the brisket. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly and handled our individual (group of 30) payment of the bill with grace.I will go back for some more beer and a burger!"
"I had the best Filet that I have ever had at Ruth's Chris in Chicago last night. ��The ambience was nice, and the service was great. ��Our server Petra made it a nice evening. ��My girlfriend and I ordered the 39.99 three course special as well as the blue crab cakes appetizer. ��The blue crab cakes were to die for. ��The filet was perfectly cooked. ��It is was so good. ��I spent quite a bit of time slowly savoring every bite and flavor. ��The sides of squash, and garlic potatos were cooked to perfection, and our dessert with flan and exotic fruit was prepared just right as well. My girlfriend tried one of the their famous back cherry martini's. ��Suffice is to say, she loved them both. ��I give Ruth Chris kudos on every level. ��They blew it out of the park last night. ��Thank You!"
Awesome place to eat! I have ate here several times and the food gets better everytime. The owner is always welcoming and talking to everyone at each table. I would definitely eat here again.
very good
Pizza is a bit on the pricey side. Nonetheless they only make quality pizza with quality ingredients.
"Incredible, succulent duck. One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago for authentic Chinese cuisine. We regularly order the Beijing Duck dinner, and I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! Go to Sun Wah!Reservations recommended, but it's worth the (at times very long) wait if you didn't make one."
"My kids always like the ravioli and truffle toast. ��My youngest daughter loves the ricota and the pasta and sauce is almost as good as the sauce I used to eat at a restaurant in Los Gatos, California 10-12 years ago that is still the best I have ever had.Everytime i have the swordfish it has been delicious. ��My wife smiles and thinks of ways to get me to make time to dine at Davanti's whenever we are in the Chicago area. ��Considering the quality, the prices are very reasonable... it can get a little loud, so we tend to eat there early. �� Try the Uovo in Raviolo 'an Domenico. ��You will want more than one!Colin"
"The Colombian typical plate was awful. ��The chicharones (fried pork skin) were greasy and disgusting. ��The beans were not the good, Colombian style ""Cargamanto"", they were more like canned pinto beans. ��The skirt steaks were smelly and very tough. ��Las Tablas should be fined for calling this Colombian."
"In my years in Chicago, I often visited this place for lunch. ��They have a pretty large menu, covering many different types of cuisine. ��The portions are large, and make sure to save room for their made-for-you desserts. ��The d��cor is pretty cool, and I really haven't had anything that I disliked. ��Their breakfast menu is great, too (I have tried making omelets like theirs, but have fallen short many times...)."
"Ambiance was wonderful with a lot of energy. ?The hostess sat us at a table and there was only 1 drink menu for five of us. ?We had to get our menu as no one attended to us. ?The food was good - flatbread with rib meat was my favorite. ?Drinks are very over-priced.If you are over 5'5 and sitting in one of the wooden chairs, you will be most uncomfortable. ?This may sound strange but when you are paying that much $ for a lingering meal, you want to be comfortable. ?The seat of the chair is not deep enough."
"I had dinner here with a friend at her suggestion. ��It's not exactly the type of place I would go for, myself, but I enjoyed dinner. ��Although it was a Saturday evening, we didn't have to wait terribly long for a table. ��The food was quite enjoyable, better than expected, really. ��The dessert, a custard something-or-other who's name I regret not remembering was phenomenal. ��Really, I would go back just to have that dessert again.On the downside, its design does nothing to minimize sound. ��As a result, it's very noisy, which can make conversation challenging."
best i've had. lots of potions and its all great. simple!
"I'm eating as I type, and there is sauce all over my fingers and keyboard. It's the best sandwich I've ever had! THE FOODIE'S CHOICE CRISP is bursting with all of these amazing flavors. Given that my trip to Crisp was supposed to end with a small snack, saving the rest for later, I'm surprised to find that I just finished the whole thing. DELICIOUS! I'll be back!"
The BEST pizza in the hood ��LOVE IT. ��Waitstaff is nice and without over doing it .YUM YUM YUM!!!!!!
HEAVEN �� �� �� �� ��what more is there to say?
"I will never go to another Mexican place in Chicago again., well, at least not sober.It was a Thursday night and I felt like eating enchiladas. So, I came onto yelp, typed in enchiladas or something, and wala, I was given Mayan Palace. And the reviews said they had half-priced margaritas on Tuesday and Thursday nights. Awesome.So my girlfriend and I hopped in a cab and mosey'ed our asses over here. It's a quiet little joint, and it was jam-packed, as in, to the point that the line extends out the front door. There was also a midget standing on someone's shoulders downing a pitcher of lemon margarita.We're standing there, thinking, Fuck, we're not going to get a seat for like an hour. and the lady says Fifteen minutes.Awesome.We grab a margarita, and maybe ten minutes later, we've got seats"
"If you are looking for great sushi that is affordable, this is the place to go. The atmosphere is great as well. They play music that fits in with the tone of the restaurant and the wait staff is very friendly. Overall a great place to get delicious sushi. Check it out."
Great milkshake. ��Great Casado. ��Great Spicy Guac. ��5 stars!
"We've only ordered delivery from here. ?The delivery staff is excellent -- while they all look like they should be opening for a White Stripes concert, they have in every case been timely and incredibly friendly. ?I would give this place five stars if my review were based solely on the original, New Haven style crust -- but we ordered the red pizza a few nights ago and found that the crust was almost too dry and tough to be able to chew all the way through. ?I would order again, but just stick with the original crust from here forward."
"Las Tablas is an amazing restaurant with an amazing staff. Went there last night for my sisters birthday party.Our waiter advised us not to get appetizers if we were getting the combo because of the size, and then when we tipped him above the auto 18% because he was AMAZING, he reminded us that gratuitiy is included. Great staff that really wants to meet the needs of the clients, rather than gouge us w every dish. ��Our waiter (i didn't catch his name unfortunately) was very attentive, friendly, and funny.Three of us shared the Large Combinationa which was fantastic. All of the meats were cooked perfectly--tender and delicious. Another guest had the Paella and raved about it! Overall amazing experience."
"Heard rave reviews from my sister so I couldnt wait to try this place. As soon as we arrived, the staff was very sweet. They seated us quickly. I decided to try the popular stuff. I got the rueben and chocolate peanut butter shake. The shake tastes literally like a Snickers bar! The Reuben was humongous.. It was delicious and certainly lived up to the hype. The real gem on the menu is the monzerella sticks. I was in heaven and couldn't stop munching on them. Never had vegan cheese taste that good. ��You must try this place at least once in your life!"
"The food was amazing. ��We started with three cheese selection - the truffle cheese was the best. ��We also had the almonds fried in bacon, which was just ok. ��My favorite two dishes were the grilled octopus and the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. ��The seating was the only negative thing about the restaurant. ��It's communal tables, which is no problem at all, but we were sat near the door and people who were waiting for tables were practically standing on top of us and kept bumping into the backs of our chairs. ��I will def return."
"Really enjoyed the restaurant and food. ��The owner was very friendly and welcoming, along with the overall service. ��The menu was filled with Romanian food and options. ��Entrees were fantastic and large, around $15 each, many appetizers and salads. ��Would recommend and come back!"
"holiday weekend w/the family took mom for a cocktail, seriously the rudest/insecure bartender in the city, it's the bearded guy and stay away, girl w/ponytail rocks, makes great drinks and friendly. ��The dude has a real problem. When was the last time you acutually told a 69 yr old lady to f off because you (the bartender) were inept. ��Way to go dude, hope you feel like a man"
"The food's great and while the sandwiches can be considered pricey to some, the flavors are unique. You don't usually get the type of ingredients that they put into their sandwiches, so as long as you can appreciate it. On the other hand I'm sure there are plenty of people who would say I don't get the hype or I could just get a deli sandwich or $5 footlong - why bother for a sandwich. So, I'd say know what you're getting into. A tasty $9-$10 sandwich with unique flavors. The churros are also great, but again there will be some saying it's a churro. While I agree, it was probably the best churro I've had to date.For me, I really like the place, definitely think it's worth it (especially considering the premium you have to pay for either Frontera or Topolobampo) and will definitely be back."
"Lived in Chicago six years and finally went to Hot Doug's - not sure what the big deal is supposed to be. ��Awful line with 90% non-locals, not a terribly good neighborhood, etc. ��Again not sure why Hot Doug's is a big deal."
"I'm from England and so don't know anything about Mexican food, but I've never been disappointed by the food here and keep going back. It doesn't feel like it's particularly unhealthy, either, which is a nice change for a late-night stop-off. This location (the largest of the three inexplicably close locations) has a bigger menu, although to be honest, there is never an occasion when you need a burrito bigger than a baby. If you find yourself around staggering around Ashland and Division you could do a lot worse than stop off here."
"Love it! ��Mussels are terrific. ��Fries are the best in town. ��And the beer!God, their beer selection is awesome. ��They don't allow children, which we appreciated."
"Let's start with walking in the door. My family (all adults) and I, had a reservation under a fairly common last name. We were seated in a really nice area, away from the crowd. The maitre de TOLD US that he thought we were frequent diners, which we were not. WHY would you tell us this? After letting us know that we weren't his preferred customers and seating us away from the masses, he sat the next FIVE tables in our section.The restaurant is completely over-staffed. The waitstaff was literally gossiping 4 feet from our table and really had nothing better to be doing. Fine, but do that outside of the dinning room and more discretely, please.I agree, this place is not for kids, but you sure couldn't tell by the looks of the crowd. There is no formal dress code enforced and kids were runnin"
Fav sushi to go
"Costa Rican food at it's finest! ��It's just like being there.... ��I usually dine in, but most recently I opted for take out. ��I ended up choosing the Palmito Salad with chicken. ��The beets add beautiful color and flavor with the cabbage, hearts of palm, tomatoes, avocado and tomato. The 'dressing' is basic: oil, lime and a bit a vinegar. ��It's simple, yet delicious. �� ��Again, portion was large, but I feel like I'm getting my money's worth and enjoy having lunch for work for the following day. ��Forgetting that they only accept cash, I went in to pay with my credit card. ��The owner was so nice he told me to take my food home and stop by and pay whenever I had a chance. (They do have an ATM, but I didn't have my debit card.) ��I returned to pay later that night and he offered me a free batido "
"Upon our on-time arrival we were informed that our party of four could be seated in fifteen minutes. After twenty minutes had passed (during which several later-arriving parties of four had been ushered to their seats), we inquired as to our status and were informed that we were next to be seated. Another twenty minutes and a few more seatings of other parties later, I finally got the message I should have gotten sooner: Don't choose hot. see-and-be-seen restaurants-of-the-month where favored clients are permitted to leapfrog those who precede them. (Especially when it's your wife's birthday dinner.)Instead, a short drive north took us to the venerable Kiki's Bistro, where we had--as usual--a graciously served, wonderfully prepared dinner. No wannabe airs, no panicky, whispered conferences"
"If you want Peking duck in Chicago (and trust me...you do), this is the place!"
I saw this place on tv one night I can't believe the quality of this place my father and I went there and he who is picky thought the clam chowder soup was the best he has ever had and I agree. The fish was fresh the potatoe pancake and asparagus was great. The blood Mary with shrimp in it was awesome. I will come back many times to enjoy the things I didn;t have today. Herb
"I order here about 3 times a week. The best deep-dish pizza I've had in Chicago. Nothing else on the menu lives up to how good the pizza is, so just get the pizza and enjoy!"
"Love the filet and the halibut. ��Best in the city. ��If you cannot get reservations, just wait at the bar and you can sit at one of the tables there. ��Great steak for the price."
After trying Maude's we were sent to Gilt. ��Awesome place and great bites! ��I was there for drinks and they were close to those at Maude's (same owners I believe). ��Overall a good experience!
Wow! I have to agree with Michael S. Sprout was a great experience... One of my girlfriends and I went to sprout on a Sunday. We were originally planning on dining there on Saturday but ended up changing our plans to go on Sunday. The atmosphere was great it had really relaxing music playing and wasn't crowded which was nice. We both had the Prix Fixe menu. Everything was amazing!! I started off with the foie gras and short rib for my main course.I finished off with the lemon dessert. I cannot explain the short rib it was probably one of the best dishes I have had in the US. The truffle in the potatoes were incredible while I was eating this plate I was speechless...amazing! I also have to mention our waiter did a excellent job of explaining everything. My friend and I were slowly tasting 
"Sooooooo touristy. I really can't get past that whenever I go to Grand Lux. For whatever reason my friends really enjoy this place so I go often and I never really enjoy it. The service is always subpar...my waitress was incredibly rude to me when I last went and conveniently disappeared when someone in my party accidentally spilled water on the table. We had to hail down another waiter to help us. The food is okay, definitely not fantastic. I do enjoy the music selection though."
"Anything and everything here is great. Never had something that was even sub-par. Just great. Once in a while they have a bean burger w/ pepper jack and some kind of jalapeno ailoi for the weekly special. Without hyperbole, it's almost better than any kobe beef or bison burger I've ever tasted."
Great stuffed Chicago-style pizza! One of my favorite pizza restaurants. ��Consistent quality and service.
Hands down the best Cuban/ Ethnic food in town.This is a great place for a date night or even just a great place for Sunday brunch.The Caribbean flavors are are wonderfully put together to make it one of my top five restaurants in Chicago.Cafe 28's Sunday brunch was rated by Rachel Ray as one of the best Sunday brunches in the country so we had to see for ourselves and I must say that it was absolutely wonderfully ��delicious and full of fun live Latin Jazz music.We loved it!!!
"Man, really? ��4.5 stars average? ��Has nobody who reviewed this place ever been to a ""real"" bakery before? ��They get lots of stars for service but only 2 for the food. ��Very mediocre, especially for the price. ��If I'm going to pay that much I'll hike up to Lutz's or Dinkels.I'll admit the outdoor seating is great, when available."
"Excellent food, from the cornbread to the gunthorp chicken, the vegetable sides to the pork belly, and the delicious gnocchi, everything was great. ��Interesting preparations grounded in flavorful regional beginnings. ��We had a group of four and we were dickering over the iroquois cornbread (I won). ��Very dark ambiance made it difficult to read the menu (but isn't that what that flashlight app is for); a bit noisy as the room fills. ��Our server, Mark, was exceptional - humorous and knowledgable. ��We will all be back often!"
"This is the best pizza in the world!!! there's a ton of cheese and an awesome sauce to top it off, the crust goes with it well. This is by far my favorite pizza."
"This place has a great beer menu and great bar food. The Anti-hero IPA is a standout . The diverse crowd is always fun and having been there over 10 times in the past year, I can say that the crowd is pretty consistently fun. A plus is the fact that even though it is in Logan Square, the hipster vibe has not taken over this place so it will survive all ironic movement currently sweeping other gastropubs. ��The service is really good for a bar/pub/restaurant and very friendly. I can't remember the name of our server during our most recent visit but he had a great vibe and knew his beers as well. Actually, he made the entire meal very fun and my out of town guest commented on how he wished more servers were like our server. Nice job!The food was really good for a pub and actually some of the "
"I really wanted to like this restaurant since we live so close to it. ��Unfortunately the whole experience was not good. ��It started with a cockroach-like looking bug scurrying across the floor under our table - we were told it was a water bug. ��We overlooked this bad start (it was a nice day and the doors were open a lot so there was a good chance it just came in) and ordered our meals. ��The Caesar salad was a little dry, the chicken was VERY salty (think eating pure salt), and the steak didn't have a good flavor. ��The strawberries that came with dessert were sour. ��The service was slow. ��The one positive note is that the manager did come and apologize for the bug - but we were surprised to see that there was no offer to give a discount (even after running around until we killed the bug). "
"Just left my first lunch and had to write a review. ��Artisans at reasonable prices. ��The Insalada Mista was beautiful and excellent. ��Has assortment of Olives! ��Pizza Margharit was perfect taste, size and speed.No industrial American pizza here"
"Love this restaurant, great service and great food. ��I always enjoy dining here and also they give out coupons which is great since we love dining here so much!"
"Stay away from a waitress wearing glasses called Teng Fei.I hope they fired her and sent her back to Szechaun, China."
"I dined in the lounge area because there was a wait for the dinning area. ��It was extremely loud. The service was average. Not bad, but not good. But the major disappointment was the food!We had the guacamole & yuca for appetizers. blahI had the pollo billy for an entree. It was extremely bland! No flavor what-so-ever! ��I substituted the french fries for beans and rice. The worst beans and rice I have had in a long time. They too were bland and reminded me of something pre-made and out of a box.My bf had the arranchera (skirt steak), he said it was okay but nothing to write home about. ��Plus the portion was extremely small considering the price. Overall, very overrated and over priced! So many more latin restaurants in the city with better, more authentic food at way better prices! Would N"
"Very impressed. ��Had the Black Power Oatmeal Stout and hello, very well done. ��Best stout i've ever had by a pretty wide margin. ��Very rich, with a great finish. ��Food was very good; simply great pub food. ��Excellent fries, great batter for the beer-battered fish 'n' chips. ��Can't wait to be back."
Last Friday I stopped at the Gage for lunch. Had a great experience there. The wait staff seated us immediately and was very attentive. Had the fish and chips-would highly recommend.
"late night hours and great share plates. ��Its great to have restaurants like purple pig, longman & eagle and gilt bar opening up in chicago. ��The more the better!"
"If you are into messed up lines, slow service, big attitudes, eye rolling and pen tapping, this IS the place for you!!!Additionally, if you are into the grunge look, you'd be in the right place. I'm all for ��everyone having their own style but when you look like you just rolled out of bed, couldn't brush your teeth or wash your face, then that's a problem. The food is adequate, nothing special...The space is cramped, mommy's with huge off road strollers, and a staff that only their own mother's could love!!!!No one, no one on the staff smiles there. The sad troll of a girl at the counter sneers rather than speaks...Take $20-$30 out of your wallet and just flush it down the toilet!I blame the owner, she raised/trained them to be the unhappy, grumbly, eye rolling oompa loompas that they are."
"The food is good, but it was way overpriced for how simple most of the dishes were. Great that they have exotic cheeses and meats, but so do most of the grocery stores around. It is also very, very small, crowded and noisy at peak times (seems like it would violate regulation, actually, since you can hardly move between tables). Outside is nice though, and a good place to chat over light fare."
Absolute garbage!!! Waited way too long for my reservation... The food was not good and the staff was overwhelmed! I think Japonais is a much better option! I felt like no one was eating there.... oh yeah that is because the anorexic girls were all coked up and on a liquid diet. Have fun with this place if you choose to go. WHAT A JOKE!!!
"I have to start by saying that I'm a picky pizza eater. ��I'm not from Chicago and have a really hard time with ""Chicago style"" pizza. ��This pizza place is by far the best I've had up here. ��Their pan crust is awesome, and the toppings are fantastic. ��My favorite part is that the pizza isn't swimming with sauce. ��I also like that ��you get a free liter of soda with orders over a certain amount of money! I will definitely be ordering again."
"Dinner at Zed may have been one of the most delicious meal yet this year. The food is seriously as good as it gets. To start they have this incredible rustic harvest bar (it makes you want to go to Italy and hug a grandmother) and then me ordered the most amazing meats, life changing, from fish to steak. I know, this combination on the same table doesn't seem appropriate!? But Zed, how you make it work, I do not know, but I thank you. I ate a potato salad that was so rich and so light all at once, I was in sheer delight with each bite. The cheese plates sealed the finish, now thats the ticket! Best ever. We had dessert topped not with a cherry but bananas!! The staff was great and worked with us to make a very personalized and special dinner. The atmosphere is both intimate and social. It "
"Always great in my opinion and the White Dragon is amazing.....we practically lick the plate. ��With that being said, the only knock would be two things:1. ��one bathroom.....it's sort of annoying. ��And they should know better because it's byob.2. ��A tad on the pricey side. ��Just a touch. ��Still, that's just picking. ��We've been 20+ times and we will continue to go."
"I had never heard of New Haven pizza before coming here, but I am now a fan. ��The thin crust is a nice change from the way-too-filling Chicago style pizza (which I have to admit I love too). ��There are some very interesting pizza toppings although you can definitely order standard pepperoni/sausage/veggie as well. ��We had a large group and ordered one with mashed potatoes and bacon, which was surprisingly good. ��Not something I would really need more than one piece of, but fun to try nonetheless. ��The chocolate dessert pizza was also wonderful- the fact that I absolutely love Nutella probably helps :) ��If you can get a spot in the cove to the left of the door, it is probably the best place to sit. ��It's far less loud and is a great place for bigger parties. ��Overall, I would definitely rec"
"This place has been here forever, a real Chicago treasure. But Calo has never been as good as it is now, from food to drinks to entertainment, everything is top-notch. I remember the old Calo, with its dark red booths and mediocre wedding bands. But this new, bright, happy Calo is what its all about. The food is better than ever, though its always been good, and the entertainment is now the best this place has ever seen. Where else can you see a great live band for free that can play pretty much any song you request - and play it DAMN well too? The band is called Higher Ground - I've seen them at least ten times over the past few months. Always a great time."
"I really appreciated what was happening here. ?From the moment I walked in I felt like I was in someone's home. ?It didn't have the I'm so ?precious feeling that sometimes new places give off. ?There seemed to be a central energy and a happy feeling buzzing around it. ?We were seated in the lounge area while waiting for a table. ?I liked the darkness there amidst orange glowing light bulbs. ?We were greeted right away by a server who just wanted to say hi and give us time to look over the cocktail list. ? We ended up getting a couple, the sazerac and the martinez--both top notch. ?Before our drinks were finished a table opened up by the kitchen. ?It was fun to watch the chefs in there doing their thing, not to mention the wonderful smells near it. ?Our food ? was simply, simply scrumptious"
"The pizza was great. There's not need to go on and on like others have about that. But the service ruined the entire experience. We went in on a Sunday afternoon and the server was in another world. She was TERRIBLE. She forgot our drinks, our refills, and our condiments we asked for. It was borderline comical. When I went to the bar to see if I could pick up the beer that had been sitting, the hateful bartender told me that she has other tables, you know. Oh really? I hadn't noticed the 2 other tables she had. My bad. And then when my friend let the manager know how awful it was, he said Sorry about that and walked away. Wow 1-star for you Pequod's...sorry about that"
I just love there stuffed pizza. It is filled with a lot of cheese and sauce. You do not have even ask for extra sauce they do an exquisite job on it. I rate 5***** ! I think that they are way better then Giordano's and there employees are friendlier. This is definitely the Best place for a deep dish pizza. Which is known as the stuffed pizza. Love it!
"I am stunned that so many people praise the pizza at La Villa. ��I tried three pizzas there tonight: one thin crust, one stuffed and one pan. ��They were all bad. ��The sauce tasted like it was out of a can, the flavorless crust was far too thick for a stuffed pizza, the toppings were utterly unimpressive. ��I will not eat it again. ��Here's a more complete review: http://www.chicagopizzac��_"
"OMG This place rules. Just moved to chicago and was told I should check this place out. Herd nothing but great things about this place from my buddy and sure lived up to the hype. Now I've eatten at many places in this great land and Glenns is Da Bomb. I haven't had seafood this good in boston or south carolina,so to get seafood this great in Chicago next to a train stop well F me to tears gonna have to write home to moma about this place. Service top notch and no tux awsome,small yes but it's so south park cool.Please,Please don't tell anyone other wise I'll have a harder time getting a seat. Back home a crab leg dinner is $35 for a 1lb dinner.Hell I just spent $35 for all u can eat and started with 2lbs and great corn to. So go before the word gets out. Congrats Glenn your in my top 3 in"
"I like most of the food . They use fresh ingredients and it is tasty except I hate that ginger tea. Unfortunately ,I am allergic to something in that great sauce they use on the side. I love it but it gives me a migraine.I t is an attractive place and they play very nice ,interesting music. It is a great alternative to heavier chinese food. The lunch specials are very reasonable. Try it . There is usually ��parking ��during the day but beware the parking police are out in force."
"Alright...I generally like this place, so good things first...Their pizza really is EXCELLENT!Large pies, thin crust, fresh toppings...all you'd ask for.Some of their home made beer is also pretty good.Now to the things that have p... me off the last times I went:The staff is not nearly as friendly as they used to be. If I wait for a table for almost 2 hours, I don't want to be yelled at by the staff for standing in their way close to the bar...Which leads to No.2 and 3 of my recent complains:This place is just too crowded and way too loud! When there are approx. 200 people in your venue (mostly in larger groups) eating pizzas, drinking beer, talking...why would you turn up the music THAT loud?So don't go here if you want to actually talk with your friends/group.If you decide to go, to gra"
"I love this place.. the owner comes to the table and describes what is in each dish. ��That definitely adds a cool personal touch to the experience! ��Its also BYOB, which I love, because there is nothing I hate more than wasting money on a whole bottle of wine and ending up not liking it. ��Everything I've had to eat here is delicious and unique. ��The only thing I don' tlike about this place is the size.. its kinda small so expect to wait a little bit for a table."
"Went a couple of weeks ago. ?The food is good, but the service poor, which almost ruins the experience. I have no idea why the manager or owner don't address this issue. ?It is so annoying when you are with friends and you have to look for the vanishing waitress. ?Come on, now!"
"Quite tasty but slightly overrated. ��And what's with having to call ahead 3 months to get a reservation? ��I meant the food is pretty impressive but it's 100% packed 100% of the time. ��We celebrated a birthday at Frontera last week. ��Everyone seemed to be quite happy with their meal. ��Specialty drinks were strong, expensive and good. ��Flautas and desserts were great. ��So was the mole sauce. ��I'd go back for another special occasion, assuming I have the foresight to plan 3 months ahead of time."
Stopped for lunch very tasty.
"Finally got to stop in and it was great, best selection of beer in one sitting. ��Went on a Friday night and was too crowded for me, but just what I've been looking for to try a variety of beer."
Ahhh great food! I am very familiar with Greek food and I have been to most of the Greek town restaurants and I have to say that this one definitely has some of the best food yum!
What can I say - it was an incredible experience.Michael called me 1 month after I left him a message on his voice mail. ��He was apologetic and was able to accommodate my party of 6 on a Friday night. ��Which is a big deal for this small space. ��The decor is not much to write home at but frankly that is not why you go to Schwa. ��Michael and his crew are truly artists with food as their medium. ��We ordered the 9 course tasting menu and got more like 12 courses. ��The presentation was amazing and flavors haunting. ��Some complain about the music but we loved it and honestly it helped make the atmosphere nice and casual. ��Bottom line is this: ��To get a meal like this anywhere in the world(I say this because I just returned from Europe) you would pay three times as much and have to put up with a 
"OMG go here right now! ��Awesome rolls with crazy combinations. ��Not your traditional sushi place. ��You must try the Godzilla at least once - its bigger, tastier and more satisfying than any other roll you have ever had. ��Other favs are the white tiger and spicy scallop if you are looking to make your mouth burn. ��Order the honey for a sweet, crunchy dessert. ��This place is BYOB so leave the car at home, take a cab and have some fun :)"
"I am a 22 year veteran of the annual National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago, and was delighted to be an invited guest for a reservation at Graham Elliot. While enjoying a drink before dinner and munching on the signature popcorn, our host and global wine expert commented on the unreasonably priced wine list....Our party of five was seated and treated to very fun and delicious first and second courses. I enjoyed the signature deconstructed caesar salad with brioche twinkie followed by superb foie gras.Sadly - My fond experience stopped, as my veal entree was difficult to eat with little flavor and chewy protein.Our table review was met with a variety of positive & negative comments on the evening, and shared our embarrassment for our ��gracious host.After reading this review, it is "
"After three attempts to dine at the Gage, I still don't understand the popularity. ?Tables are so crowded that on one visit my shoulders were crammed by the two individuals on either side...from seperate tables. ?Yet my dining partner was three feet away on the other side of the table. ?The place is not lively, it's NOISY. ?So loud that my dining partners and I can't hold a conversation and resulting in feeling deaf after leaving. ?Rude service...hauty. ?My second visit had the tables so close, that three other tables of diners had to scoot over for my partner to sit down, completely embarrasing us. ?The hostess was not helpful, just staring into space while we dealt with the situation. ( my partner is only 180 pounds and tall...so being a heavy person was not the issue). ?Similar issues w"
"5 stars. My wife and I were having our date night and wanted authentic Italian food. We decided to try to something close to her work when I picked her up. It was right by her job and this place was exactly what we looked for. ��The valet guy was not working because it was on a weekday, and the manager was nice enough to find us a free parking spot. The prices are reasonable and the menu was great. Service was amazing. Our favorite thing about a restaurant is good service, we will definitely be back."
Simply It is an apt name for this restaurant. My girlfriend and I go there almost two to three times a week. The bubble smoothies are great. They use real fruit in each smoothie. I would recommend the avocado smoothie. The food is just as good too. The Salmon Noodles are excellent. I would also suggest that more people try the Beef Noodles. It has a nice spice to it. The staff is also very friendly. Tuan is the best host. This a place everyone should try at least once: I guarantee it will not be your last visit.
ok... this place is good but when you compare it to Texas de Brazil it pales in comparison. ��Texas de Brazil has a bigger and better buffet (if you can believe that) Fogo de Chao does not offer sea food or soups in their buffet. ��Not a deal breaker but would be nice. ��The service was good and the servers had personality and flair. Will return but recommend trying ��Teaxas de Brazil.
"If you like cuban, you need to stop in for a lechon and a cafe. ��the guanabana shake was amazing. �� on my drive home... will definitely be taking out often. ��^^"
"I've been to all three big Brazilian Steakhouses(also Fogo and Texas de Brazil) and all of them have their pluses and minuses but this one edges to the top for the following reasons. ��I'm not much of a salad person, but I did notice their salad bar had the least variety. ��However, their hot section of the salad bar was great ��especially the mushroom risotto. ��I've been here three times and the service was just iffy once and I would almost venture to say that the gauchos were the most attentive. ��And although you need to make a reservation, we've had to wait each time but honestly what big restaurants don't have a minimal wait. ��The martinis are the best out of the three also. ��I've had the Mojito and Pomegranate Martini. ��The other thing that sets it apart is that it has all of the meats b"
"Amazing! ��Favorite New Spot! ��From the creatively sweet and delicious drinks to the innovative crispy seared rice nigiri, loved every minute! ��The service impecable, the management flawless, the decor breath taking. ��I couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate my birthday! ��It was so good that I took out of town friends the next week for cocktails and appetizers in the lounge and had a marvelous night!"
"Well, what can I say that has not already been said. I've been a loyal patron of Wildfire for over 10 years. Hands down the ABSOLUTE BEST steakhouse in the state. The downtown Chicago location has the best ambiance and servers by far, but the suburban locations are fabulous as well. The Wildfire has me so spoiled, I never eat steak anywhere else because I always end up disappointed. Even if I go to a steakhouse, I order ribs or prime rib because I know the steak will not be up to par. The Stuffed Shrimp appetizer holds a special place in my heart, not much can top it. Entree - Medium Rib-Eye w/parmesan crust and a side of broccoli. All the sides are to die for, so take your pick. Regardless of your cut, be sure to ask for Parmesan Crust. I guarantee you will thank me. My bartender at Wildf"
"I've been looking for great Neapolitan pizza in Chicago since having the BEST pizza at Grimaldi's in Brooklyn... and I have to say that this place is spot on! It definitely satisfied my craving! I think pizza is best when it's simplified, they definitely get that here :-) Delicious, and I can't wait to go back! Oh, and the canoli is sooooo good!"
"Wish I could give 4.5 stars. ?I have yet to try the whole menu, but cafe 28 has my favorite dish in chicago - the duck tenderloin with portabella mushroom sauce. ?Mojitos. ?Awesome food. Great cevice. Good service. ?Go here for an awesome night (where the price is definitely a bit lower than downtown, yet you'll have a great experience). ?If I were ever on check please I would do this place, but it has already been done. ?Take friends/ dates/ whomever you please to this place and you won't be disappointed."
"Great bar, very chill, you can actually hear people when they talk. ��Beer is expensive but amazing and Belgian beer has twice the alcohol content of American beer so it evens out. ��Food is great (try the mussels) ��you can usually find seats at the bar if not a table (if you go fairly early). ��I have had an excellent time every time ive gone."
"although i have been a faithful follower of las tablas since it opened, my recent experience there left me wondering what are they thinking!!!!! ��the food was fair at most and the portions were literally half of what they use to be despite no reduction in price. ��a meal $38 ��for 2 left both persons hungry and in spite of our complaints, we were told this was purposeful. the waitress tried her best but no one else was available to even listen. ��SERVICE was terrible and the food was fair at most. ��POOR customer relations. will not return."
"LOVE IT! ��This place is very consistant with their rolls. ��We always get this delivered, and it always gets a 5-star. ��Pretty reasonable too. ��Love the honey roll! ��Try it!!"
"I really WANTED to like this restaurant. We live in River North and always get excited when something new opens up. My husband took me there last night for my birthday. The wait staff was extremely nice and I have to say the decor is really pretty. Other than that, there were no other redeeming qualities. Everyone commented on how trendy the crowd is at Sunda but I felt a bit over dressed and most people were just in jeans dressed down (it was a Sat night!).....so not that trendy. I ordered a drink which was served in a mug (looked like a soup bowl). Not classy. The food was rushed. In fact, our entree came out before our app! We ordered what the waitress recommended - Crab crusted ahi tuna and the firecracker roll. Don't go to Sunda hungry because the portion size is perfect for a toddler"
For those of you who don't want to get caught up in the hype - This place is the yuppies trendy hot dog stand. There is nothing special about this place. Its costly the fries taste burnt/ Let alone that stupid fois de gras. Yuppy snobs. The line is excruciating most days and you are very lucky to find a spot to sit down. I really was hoping for better
"Love the Pizza, but their staff can be rude when taking your order over the phone. Be ready to give your order fast. I have ordered in the past and on several occasions feel rushed when given my order for pick up. Then I get there and have to wait half an hour for the pizza. I love their pizza, but wish they had a more courteous staff."
Gavin was great. Smiled a lot and we like his mustache. Good food and nice decor... a small part of West Hollywood that fell hard into Chicago. You'll like it if you're up for the scene.
"This is the best taco meat i have ever tasted in my life(outside of Mexico of course)! The little steak cubes are so deliciously seasoned with who knows what. For steak tacos, this is the spot to go.Drunk or sober, they taste just as good. I have not tried anything else on the menu but why bother when you can order the steak tacos and never be disappointed? The only negative here is the salsas which are bland and icky."
"Being at Alliance is like reading its reviews on here: ��a LOT of people preoccupied with cupcakes.....(get a life people) �� The uptight ungracious tsk tsk attitude of the place is constantly annoying: ��if you want the relaxed atmosphere of a cafe and the chance to meet people occasionally, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU .....Apparently all these people who feign study and high concentration are way too easily distracted, so they must not be studying or doing anything they care passionately about. �� If you talk in there, or answer your cell phone, not only do you get a lot of hostile ��looks, but there is always someone twerpy and backward enough to explain condescendingly that you should NOT talk on your cell phone in there: ��again: get a life people: ��its 2009, people talk on their cell pho"
"I was promised that the coffee would be the best I ever had. ��I'm pretty sure that's true. ��It's real good. ��Taste like an angel spit in it, which is a good thing, as I see it. ��That tuna sandwich on the croissant is real damn good, too... like them walnuts in there. ��That croissant will make a mess, though. ��Don't be eatin' it over your mama's good couch.I really like that red pepper hummus, too. ��Put that shit on a bagel, you gonna have a real good time in your own mouth!I ain't too big on no sweet things as my teeth is all janky and the sugar hurt me a good one. ��I do like them ladies behind the counter. ��They real nice, 'specially that one with the glasses and the square jaw that always be reading the New York Times. ��I don't like New York, but I do like that bataristo. ��I bet she do r"
"I was excited for this place to open from the first time I saw the menu. Fried cheese curds, french fries pulled pork- Awesome. Some friends and I thought we might as well go check it out on a rainy day. Our waitress, Joey, was really nice and gave real recommendations on the menu.(not those half ass- people seem to like it reccomendations- hate those) ?She was even kind enough to ask the chef and bring out a piece of ham for my friend who was worried about the smell/ taste (she is preggo and very sickened by the smell of beer). we had beer and water whenever we needed it (no- preggo friend didn't have any ;)), my cheese curds were excellent and yes, I agree with everyone else the fries were great. My boyfriend had the poutine which he had been drooling about for weeks and really liked it."
"I know everyone loves this place. I dined there with my family a few months ago. ��The atmosphere and service is great. ��But the food, nothing special in my opinion. ��Dessert was solid, but the other courses were not great, just okay. For the amount of money and reputation it carries, I was disappointed."
"This was my first venture into Ethiopian cuisine really, so I had no idea what to expect, but what a great surprise. ��Wonderful food: interesting, well cooked and presented. ��My wife found the Teff bread to be a bit acidic, but that's just the nature of it, having tried it at a few other places since. ��Other reviewers have faulted the service, and it was a bit... tentative at first, but she seemed to warm up a lot as the meal progressed - so overall I was quite happy with her.We'd definitely go back."
amazing cocktails in a really cool space. ��the bartenders are really professional and the room is groovy!i love this place!!!
Went to the Kinzie Chophouse with 3 other friends after the theatre. Loved the decor of the resturaunt and the staff was most professional. Wine selection was delish. We all order the special which was filet medallions with peppercorn sauce and herb crusted shrimp with red pepper risotto. The shrimp was delicious except it didn't have a herb crust on it. 3 of ��us did not recieve our meat cooked correctly and it had ��no flavor. The risotto was to die for. Considering this is a steak house I was very disappointed that the steak did not impress me at all.
I had a great dinne. Treated us really well and the food was fantastic. Great italian food.
"I've eaten at the Diner countless times and it's exceptional. ?I always go for the sandwiches and either the french onion soup or the sweet potato fries as a side. ?The gyro is excellent and the chikn caesar wrap is great. ?I really haven't tried the entrees because most of the those dishes are similar to dishes that I make at home. ?I think it's nice for non-vegetarians and non-vegans to try some of our staples like BBQ seitan and panko fried tofu. ?The shakes are amazing and their raw desserts are truly delicious. ?So, I guess I would urge people to get a shake with the gyro and sweet potato fries and share a raw dessert. ?Enjoy!"
"Love Nuevo Leon! My family and I have been going there since I was a kid. Their food is great and their prices are low. As others have said, they're cash-only, but there is an ATM in the restaurant. Also, it's BYOB and they don't have an alcohol on the menu. Their tacos are great and we love their Queso Panela and Quesadillas Raul. Also, their fajitas are awesome. Definitely recommended! They have a small parking lot down the block, which is exclusive to the restaurant. All you have to do is taking the card the parking attendant gives you and have them sign it when you're paying the bill. However, if the lot is full, it's street parking only, which can be a pain in that area. Also, beware going there on the weekends because it can get crazy busy! We've been there when the line of people wa"
"This restaurant is nasty.The other day when I was off work I decided to check out the restaurant, but then when I looked at it, it said their license was suspended ��which grossed me out, it said it was due to health hazard or something like that, I went to pho viet which was a lovely place and I quite enjoyed it."
"My husband and I visited Geja's cafe on Saturday, April 28,2012 it was my B-day. I made a reservation on 6:30pm and we where late for 18 min. Actually,we where there at 6:15pm, however we where looking for the parking for 25 minutes. The restaurant doesn't have any parking at all including valet. When we came in and I showed my Travelzoo coupon we where told that our table was given to somebody else,because we where late and we have to wait for a next available table. My husband and I spend one hour and fifteen minutes at the bar. However, at 8:15pm I saw three empty tables. I came to manager and he told me people are late, but they call and he is holding tables for them and I have to wait until 9:15pm just maybe somebody didn't show up. At that time my evening was already ruined and I ask"
This is where I go for some quick CAVIAR yup thats right better that getting it shipped. The staff is very well versed in all tastes and lets say they know what they are doing for sure at this place
"Best Hot Dogs, this place lived up to its reputation. The decor inside is excellent, the line that runs outside the front door was not, but it was worth the wait."
"Went to Piece yesterday for pizza and beer after work, so it was not crowded. As usual the beer and pizza was great, however the service was indifferent at best. The bartender seemed to think she was doing us a favor went she did finally approach us. I hope this was a isolated incident."
"Me and a couple of my girlfriends went to Chicago last weekend. ��We heard about Brazzaz and decided to go. ��The service was lacking a little, we had to ask several times for water and we looked for our server a few times to ask some questions. ��We were at the bar before we sat down and I'll never forget his name Fritz was the best. ��The drinks were delicious and he was so knowledgable about the wines, and the place in general. ��What we thought was lacking in service he made up for in the beginning and at the end. ��What a bartender!! �� ��If you go, make sure you stop at the bar."
Amazing food and service. Highly recommended.
"Sabatino's is unbelievable...menu..wine list...staff. ��We have had a great experience every time that we have visited. ��This place is a hidden gem on the North West Side, it has incredible Italian food, ��if you live nearby and have not tried it, you are missing out. ��The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming, it seems like it is small from the outside until you you are seated and it keeps going and going ��The latest owner has owned it for 30? years, and I bet it is as good today as it was back then. ��The Spinach Gnocchi, among many other dishes, is great. The Gundlach-Bundschu Chardonnay is the perfect start!"
"I am from out of town and this was my third time at L&E. ��All three times were for brunch spread over the past one year. ��The first time I had biscuits & gravy, the second time I had the La Strada (which was not offered this past weekend), and this most recent time I again had the biscuits and gravy. �� The gravy was excellent and you could see the herbs in it. ��My companions ordered the duck hash and the mac 'n cheese; both were delicious. ��We sat in the back room and it was a good mix of bustle but quiet enough for conversation. ��The waitstaff was attentive but not overbearing. ��Breakfast food options at brunch were between $8 and $15. I also ordered a bloody mary, and it came in a pint glass garnished with a little cocktail sword with a cornichon and a square of cheese on it ��which I gre"
"I love this place. ��The food is terrific for lunch or breakfast. ��My husband especially likes the Nana's Baked Chilaquiles. ��They are able to meet special eating needs. ��The portions are exactly the right size, and I thought the service was exactly on target."
"Great place. I recently heard of this place and there all you can eat crab. Let me say wow! And its king crab. The place us small but they have outdoor seating which a nice day out great. our server was pleasant and attentive. Great place, will return with friends."
"So I went to Yolk for breakfast had steak n eggs n pancakes the food was great once again the service was horrible I waited about 15minsthe to get a refill of coffee once my waitress decided to give me more coffee I told her, I was about to reach over n serve myself more coffee being that you took a long time to give more coffee. I sat at the bar area that's the reason I could've reached over for some coffee but I didn't do it. I don't think ill go there again first impression is the last impression wit me good job Natasha, so never again."
"I did my potential roommate interviews here (met the sketchies from Craigslist IRL, ha) and always had a great sandwich for lunch. ��My favorite is the chicken pesto one. ��I suppose they do have a limited amount of choices, though. I also just purchased their granola from Whole Foods and it's AWESOME (so far I've tried the regular flavor), I love it with a little vanilla yogurt."

"Great pizza, great crust, laid back bar atmosphere. I'm a fan"
"WOW... What a place...great service,excellent food. I took my future bride here the day after Christmas and all I can say is...groovylicious. We were treated as if we owned the place...We are not movie stars,but we received the red carpet treatment from the moment we walked in...Big thanks to Mary and Christian...My bride to be and I love Oreo's and Orange Juice(that's are thang-didn't think I would ever find someone with a fondness for that one,but I did) Mary and Christian made it happen...with the best dessert ever...She(my bride to be)was really surprised and just out done...Thanks Brazzaz,we will be back over and over again...Hopefully everyone will just love this place..."
"I came to Chicago to visit a sick friend and i wanted to try some deepdish pizza. I'm from New Jersey where there's no shortage of great pizza....but not much quality deep dish. After reading many reviews, we landed ourselves in pequods on N. Clybourn. I've got to say their deepdish pizza was the best i ever had!!! We also stopped at Giordanos, and pequods puts them to shame. The pizza was loaded with excellent toppings, the sauce was very flavorful and oh my god the carmalized crust was awesome.......i ate every bite of that crust. If anyone can tell me where they make better deepdish please let me know and i'll fly in just to try it!!! ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?Bravo Pequods, Bravo!!!"
OK so I cant recall how many times I have driven past this restaurant and never really gave it a chance. But I have to say that after a couple years of passing this place up. I finally decided to stop in. The menu itself is well priced and the food was good considering that I have tried a variety of Mexican food. I have to say that I had a good experience here regardless of the hostess not being very accommodating ��but after all the seat is the least of my concerns. I will definitely be back.
Jeff C. I definitely remember the Dominator and this restaurant is not it.I have watched Rick on TV for years and always thought the food looked awesome and authentic. So when I happen to be in the city and came across it during luchtime I jumped at the chance to eat there. What a dissapointment.I had the steak tacos and started laughing for they arrived. For 15 dollars I got 3 tortillas(which were not handmade) and the smallest portion of meat I have ever seen. The salsas were nothing special and I left hungry and definitely unsatisfied. Don't get sucked into this place for the name...just will be dissapointed.
"I was really disappointed with my child's birthday cake which was commissioned from this bakery. ��After paying over $100, I felt that it was totally devoid of inspiration, color and creativity, not to mention that the texture was pretty dry. ��The service also left much to be desired, as they forgot to write ""Happy Birthday."""
"I used to love this place years ago. But the quality and the service has taken a huge hit the last few years. The last time I went in I think will be my last, the server did not even pay attention to us, the manager(?) was super rude, and the food was meh. I used to love the pizza's here, but the cheese pizza I got was dry and the dough was way too thick. When I told the manager I did not like it, he simply huffed and said this is the way we do things here, if you don't like it go elsewhere for pizza. RUDE!"
next time any of you are there try the tacos sabinas....awesome!
Delicious food. Presented Very FANCY! and the decor inside is very impressive.
"Reading everyone else's review -- I have to agree, I love this place. ��I moved to chicago recently from the SF bay area, and being half vietnamese, I had to scour the city for my vietnamese fix. ��I have literally tried dozens of Vietnamese restaurants around and this is among the top. ��Their lunch special is amazingly good, and a ridiculously good value. ��For the cost of a hamburger meal, here you get a banh mi (vietnamese sandwich), salad, soup, and dessert. ��That's a 4 course meal, and tastes infinitely better. ��I have been to argyle and literally tried every restaurant there, gone to chinatown and tried everything there. ��This place is great. ��You won't be disappointed, and living downtown much closer than argyle. ��The sour shrimp soup is my favorite. ��Additionally, it's not pretentious"
"This place is great. ��Great beer, fun atmosphere, and even better pizza. ��The pizza tastes like New York Style. ��Perfect place for big groups and birthday dinners. ��Thursday and Saturday night Kareoke."
"By far the best steak in Chicago. ��Mastro's is expensive, but you get what you pay for; the service was amazing, the ribeye was perfect, and the lobster mashed potatoes are worth the inevitable heart attack."
"Quite simply - loved it. ��I've been hearing about this place for a while and it is imfamously impossible to get in to on weekends, so I tried out a lazy mid-week afternoon. ��First of all, the service was excellent. ��My server (wish I got his name for the review) was only to happy to talk through the different beers with me and to suggest food pairings. ��Let's just say that two beers, and appetizer and a burger later and I was in culinary heaver. ��Started with a lighter Belgian beer (orange, coriander) and the bacon popcorn. ��Moved on to the burger with crimini mushrooms and a darker beer that lasted post-meal into my relaxed browse through the newspaper. ��I'll be back for sure!"
Simply fantastic.
"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I've had the asado de puerco and the chile relleno filled with beef, and both were muy delicioso! I keep forgetting to bring beers, since it's BYOB. Next time, next time."
"This grocery store has the worst customer service in Chicago. The manager thinks he or she can get away with outrageous prices and terrible service because it is a ""destination"" grocery store. Employees have bad attitudes and never know how to help customers. This place will go downhill fast without a change in management and complete overhaul of the employees."
"I've probably been here a half dozen times now, and each time the meal and service have been flawless. ��Keep up the good work!"
"They have really great pizza here. It's called New Haven style pizza. Never been to New haven, so I can't compare that aspect. I really admire a restaurant with it's own brewery too. I've tried most of their brews and they are excellent. It is pretty large inside with really long tables for multiple groups to sit at. This gives it sort of a mess hall/highschool cafeteria feel. Nobody's going to make you stand in the corner for being too loud here though."
Great place to go after work or on the weekends. ��The food and drink selection was great. �� Nice atmosphere and it is a good fit for River North.
Looks like I'm one of a small few who were not overly impressed by my experience at Hopleaf.The positives: The building is absolutely amazing - great structure and overall vibe. Good beer selection and bar area.The negatives: We were sat upstairs which overall I have no complaints about. Sadly our waiter up there did not help our experience. When my girlfriend asked about a particular dish he seemed uninterested and somewhat bothered by her asking. I believe that one should stand behind there products and seem excited about what they are serving; at least recommend something else if it's really that bad.Overall the atmosphere was good but the food and service could use a facelift.
"This restaurant is like every other Francesca's - good food, decent prices, good service. ��The only difference is that his location is really cramped and loud. ��If you want a nicer facility, hop on the el and go to the Francesca's on Bryn Mawr Avenue. ��Same great food, quieter and larger restaurant. ��However, we still had a great dinner and our Saturday night reservations were honored within five minutes of arriving and there was valet parking."
"I came with my husband and a few friends and I must say we had a great time. The pizza was just like I remembered in Italy. ��Our waiter was great, I think his name was Jeremy. You could tell Jeremy really liked his job because his energy and enthusiasm had us exited about our meal before it even arrived!! ��We will be back again and I will tell all my friends. The Sorrentina was amazing! ��Great service and great food!"
"For a hot dog joint, it's amazing. ��I had the Tueten and it's soooo GOOD...then again I love corned beef and to make a hot dog out of it was a great idea. ��The place opens at 1030 and when I arrived at 1015, there was already a line about 40 people deep. ��I think we ended up waiting in line 35 minutes before we got to the front (counting the 15 minute wait for the place to open). ��I think the food's great and really hits the spot if you're looking for a hot dog, but I still don't understand the extremely long lines, even in cold temperatures. ��I think being aired on the Food Network has a lot to do with it. ��So get there early. ��I tried to go once before (around 2 pm) and there had to be 100 people in line. ��The most important tip: ��ORDER THE DUCK FAT FRIES...they are only available Friday"
"My husband and I ate there the other night with some work friends. We all agreed that this was perhaps one of the best meals of our lives. Pick whatever words you want: WOW, Incredible, amazing, earth moving, genius, YUM, best meal ever, food heaven!!!! I never knew that food could be this good. I am so excited to go back.Schwa is in my opinion the best restaurant in Chicago. If you are looking for flavors which compliment each other in surprising who would have thought of that. While a completely different dining experience than Alinea and Trotters, Schwa offers the best tasting experience of them all.We paid $115 per person for the 9 course meal. They brought out extras, so it was really like eating 11 courses. Each one was a complete home run!!!!!! It was worth every penny.This restaura"
"I was a Greek food virgin when I arrived at this place. The food it's incredible, it's fresh and prepared with care. I recommed the zaganaki, and the stuffed peppers. Be careful with Greek coffee because it can be a challenge to drink. Works better if you go with a group of people and order a little of everything in the menu. The ambience goes for a meditterranean style that blends perfectly with the food and the crowd. Best of all FREE VALET!"
Great patio in the summer! We love to watch college football games here. They had prime rib sandwich last time we went in on a thursday and it was to die for! Miss the red cups :(
"I went to Piece after the hockey game Sunday night with a friend to meet two of my co-workers. ��They watched the game at Piece and enjoyed a hefty amount of food. ��I was fortunate to be at the game, and I didn't eat anything at the United Center knowing that some high-quality thin crust pizza would be heading my way when we arrived. ��The kitchen was about to close, so we called as we were leaving the game and we made the request in time. ��My colleagues are beer aficionados - one even brews his own - and they were very impressed with several of the Piece brews. ��I don't drink beer, but there was ample gin in the glass with the tonic. ��A good time was had by all. ��We live/work in New ��Jersey, but will absolutely go back to Piece on our next trip to Chicago."
"My mama taught me a few things, and loyalty is one of them. If I love you, I am loyal. Of course, you must earn my love and I do not fall in love easily. That said, once I love you, I will endure trials and tribulations for you. ��I do not hurt easily and I am not a doormat, but I understand that love often hurts. Lao Sze Chuan, here is what you do to me:First you burn my lips and throat; you leave me with a bloated belly and awful garlicky gingery breath. Then, you wake me up at 4 am by causing violent tremors in my gastrointestinal system. You turn my lower abdomen into a mini Tiananmen Square circa 1989, complete with protestors, marching soldiers, and tanks. I writhe in my bed until I realize there is no more time. I need to move quickly, yet I do not want to disturb the powerful army l"
"I liked our pizza, we had red sauce with tomato and goat cheese and it was delicious. ��I ordered the cheap light bear (I can't remember the name) which I did not at all care for, but the pizza was good and the location is great."
"PLUS:. we were seated before the one and a half hour estimate, �� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� �� ��. available street parking. the bread/cheese/GARLIC/oil on table was really good. pitcher h2O on table, .BYOB without a corking fee. they ��didn't charge the splitting fee charge for shared plates. tortellini soup was really good - just enough noodles, spinach and not too salty. bus staff was friendly. my dinner was hot, topped with fresh ground pepper, and full of cheesy goodness! ��MINUS:. dinners do not come ��with salads or soup ��. waitress wasn't the friendliest"
"The Duck experience at Sun Wah is something that everyone should try. ��Splitting a duck between 3 people will run you about $20 a person. ��A duck is rolled to your table on a cart...where it is then carved and presented. ��Sweet rolls, raw vegetables and a sweet BBQ sauce are used to make little duck sandwiches. ��The carcus of the duck is taken back to the kitchen where they make a soup and fried rice for your group. ��Overall, the food is amazing, interesting and priced well. ��This dining experience is something that you'll remember for all the great reasons!!!"
"Longest wait for food ever. ��20 minutes to heat up an already made empanada? ��The kitchen definitely needs some restructuring, as the two female cooks who handle the 4 hot items on the breakfast menu cannot handle reheating empanadas and bread pudding and constructing sandwiches. ��I've worked in restaurants, I know that it can be hectic, but this is completely ridiculous. ��The bad service is overshadowing the experience of the food. ��I can't even imagine what it would be like to wait for lunch, and I probably will never go for lunch because of my negative experiences with breakfast. ��It's disappointing to say the least. ��I'm sure a lot of people were excited for this place to open; exactly what Chicago needs right now, but the service will definitely keep me from coming back. ��The only emp"
The food was awesome the pizza was so good and the prizes are great! And the best part is that you slice right away! no wait! The quality is def worth 5 stars. I always recommend this place all the time when someone asks me for good pizza in the city! The BEST!
"I love this place. Amazing burgers, haven't wanted to try anything else, but trying friends' stuff tells me its all great food. Good selection of drinks too. And awesome atmosphere."
My wife and I love Sapori; one of our regular spots over the past 5 years since moving to the city. We love the food and staff. Do not hesitate to go.
Please don't ever ask me to go to this overpriced and lame yuppie place again!
"Love the food, but don't get delivery. delivery guy is rude. I have to pay $3.00 in delivery charge to get rude at my door step. No Thanks"
"Top notch sushi. ��We go in each time and have the waitress order for us, always end up with fantastic stuff. ��Great venue, worth the wait. ��As close to a sure thing as you can get."
"Since they expanded the restaurant, the service has been completely deplorable, and the food has not been quite as good as it used to. ��And I understand it's a BYOB, but still, I am not going to have an $80 bottle of champagne out of a plastic cup!!!"
"Entirely overrated. The decoration is cheap and kitschy. It's too loud for conversation, which I think is important for a place set up as a restaurant. On substance, the beer they brew is not at all impressive. I'd rate it a little higher than Moonshine's beer, but still somewhat below Natty Ice. The food itself is fine enough, but the menu doesn't inspire much of an appetite. The server didn't seem to know much about beer, despite working at a brew-pub. Also, he billed for the mediocre cupcake he brought out when we told them it was my friend's birthday. Not that it's absolutely de rigueur to give things away gratis on birthdays, but any little pleasantness from the waiter would've been welcomed, and would've bumped them up a star or two in my opinion. I really hate this place."
"I have been going to Sabitinos for over 10 years, mainly for lunch. The Chicago classic interior has not changed in probably 50 years. The food is a mixture of Itailian, Greek and American dishes and represent the best of values. This place is great to have a good meal and conversation. Not overly fancy but just pure Chicago! Wish they would serve the sirloin tips more often."
"I'd probably come here more often if it weren't packed all the time. ?One of the few places I've found that has roasted red peppers for a topping (note: red pepps, extra sauce, pepperoni and onions make for a kind of soggy pizza- i think it's meant to be a bit more sparce on the toppings). ?People have always been nice & the beer is good. ?Loved the Full Frontal Brew I had there recently!"
two words!sangria & guacamole!yay!!
"It was good, but it can be better ,And 24 courses is just too long."
"Three and a half starts, actually. ��My husband and I celebrated a special dinner here, and while we certainly enjoyed our experience, it didn't live up to expectations. ��We went for the Saturday Underground menu. ��It was fun to try a variety of different plates, but of the five, only two were outstanding. ��Two were above average, and the last was, well, okay. ��The service was a bit off, as a few plates were served lukewarm when they should have been hot. ��Also, we waited for a prolonged period of time before our main course... while several tables around us were finishing up with their main dish. ��The space is tiny, which I think lends itself to a warm and intimate environment, but we were seated aside two very, very loud and obnoxious women whose voices made us want to jab our knives in o"
"Go to Chicago, eat deep-dish, hot beef and get a hot dog. Where should we go? Well, everyone goes to Hot Doug's because they are the best around. In fact, you'll have to wait in line for 2 and a half hours to experience the very best, and let me tell you, it's worth it.That's what I thought, before I went to Hot Doug's. After waiting in line, eating the dogs, I wasn't thrilled, or hungry, though I was disturbed by the amount of time I wasted in line. Had I experienced the hype?After research I found that yes, the hype which surrounds this establishment is in fact, the experience of eating the hot dog or hot dogs, then having to lie to yourself to reconcile the fact you wasted two plus hours waiting for that which you just ate. Then you lie to other people, to get back at the world, to prol"
Jusat found this place last weekend. Great beer selection and a really good burger' Lots of options. I give this 4 stars as a bar and a great place to hangout.. The food is really goood bar food nothing exotic. A great wednesday night kinda place.
I highly recommend it for large groups because of its tapas style dishes. Great food!! Service was good!
"I came for my first-ever poetry slam, and enjoyed myself a lot. The venue has all kinds of atmosphere, as other reviewers describe. One person in my group didn't like it though. Both the atmosphere and the slam itself are a strong taste that won't appeal to everyone. Not a good date unless your date is cerebral. Also, the f bomb was dropped constantly on stage. I'm fine with that, but not everyone would be, so be aware. I don't drink alcohol, but for what it's worth, I had the best ginger ale with lime here. They put in a lot of lime and the sweet puckery taste was great. A friend had an apple martini and said it was very sweet but very good. The slam itself ran from 7pm to 10pm. I'll be back, and I'll probably perform next time."
"Had Simply It delivery for the first time and was very impressed. ��Their food was packaged very well to prevent spillage, the portions were huge, and we got a complimentary fruit assortment that we weren't expecting including two apples, oranges, and grapes. ��Fisherman's Pho Soup is very reasonable for the price and delicious! ��I can't wait to dine here again."
"Wow, a very cool and fun place to be. I met some friends there yesterday evening for dinner. The atmosphere is incredible - great decor. Food, service, and drinks were great. We stayed much longer than expected because the jazz trio playing in the lounge was wonderful. I'm definitely returning soon...hopefully I could catch them playing again."
"Grunt burger.Those are the only 2 words you need to know. ��They have one of the best hamburgers in the city with the perfect bun and loaded with fried onions and whatever else you want. ��They serve curly fries which are much better than normal french fries.The salad bar is just fine, but you don't need it unless you are only getting soup as the portions are huge.The bar is small and not worth your time if you are going out for a drink only. ��Go for the burger when you just gotta have one of the best. �� Great place to bring a couple of friends (great atmosphere and location), but don't even think about going with a group as the tables are small and you'll never sit together."
"I found this little place from the Chicago Scene magazine so I thought that I would give it a try. I must say that when you go you will feel as if you are in the hood, but the place is very nice. It is kind of small but the whole thing opens up to the side walk and if it is nice out there is a huge patio to enjoy. The food is excellent. It was a little busy when I was there so i did experience a little wait, but definitely worth it. On their website they have a virtual walk-Through you can walk through the whole establishment. The link for that is:http://showcase.neustep.?Check it out!"
"I like the atmosphere but like any place it all depends on the crowd. ��I've been there several times. ��When I go with my own people, always have a good time. ��I've only been to the lounge section, not dinner. ��But I recommend it for anyone wanting to get dressed up and have a good time."
Duck is awesome. ��That's all that needs to be said. ��Our friends took us here for dinner since it's close to their house. ��I had read good things about it on Eater and had wanted to try. ��Glad we got to! ��Everything we had was delicious. ��BYOB? ��Yes. ��This made things even better. ��For the 8 of us there it was pretty reasonably priced (we were expecting a lot more expensive). ��We'll be back. ��My wife talks about it regularly.
"I, too, am not typically a deep dish kinda gal. ��I'm a ""regular"" pizza or thin crust all the way. ��However, on a quick trip to Chicago I wanted to do it right so I hit up Gino's since I had seen it on Best Thing I Ever Ate and figured I couldn't go wrong. ��Boy, was I right! ��This pizza is some of the best I've ever had. ��It's a bit on the expensive side but I guess you are getting a ton of food when you order. ��I went with my partner and we ordered a medium and had more than half the pizza left so I'd definitely recommend a small for 2 people! ��I will definitely recommend this place to anyone I know visiting the city and if I ever go back, it'll be on my list of things-to-do!"
"I respect their history, as being a long time running vegan/vegetarian diner and I think that's great. I only first ate here 3 years ago so it may have changed since the 80's/90's, but I was never that impressed. There's only so far seniority can take you. Many of the fake meat dishes are made with seitan (wheat gluten), which is not rocket science to prepare. Most of the time I had it, it was more like very flavorful, savory chewing gum. Last time I had the chocolate raspberry cake....that was pretty amazing. A+ for that dessert. Anyway, if I can make it better at home and not pay top dollar for it, why go to Chi Diner? (dessert)"
anyone who doesnt give this place 5 stars must be developmentally challenged becuase it is the best restaurant in the world.
"One of my favorite restaurants in town! ��Delicious Vietnamese and pan-asian food, exceptionally friendly owner and staff, generous portions, superb value, and fast delivery. ��I am a huge fan of their lunch specials- comes with side salad, beverage (fresh ginger tea is yummy!), and fresh fruit! My roommate and I order from them at least once a week (not sure if I should be proud of that or not ;-) ��Another favorite is the beef noodle soup- very affordable and amazing flavors!Highly recommend both the restaurant and their delivery service."
"WAY too much salt! I ate there hours ago and am still dehydrated. It's also overpirced for what you get. And the wait in ridiculous for what the food is. Overall, we were not inspired by the meal and were very dissapointed."
"Really, this place is solid. ��I highly recommend the Lechon (pulled pork, plaintain, onion), the empanadas, and the cafe con leche. ��The staff are great and you should listen to their recommendations. When are you guys going to take credit cards so that I can order take out for the family without running to the ATM?Update - Arturo the owner just sent a note that they are accepting cards."
4/26/11 Terrible experience I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN. The service was absolutely horrible. The staff and the manager had no idea what was going on today. It took 40 minutes for chicken parmasean. I asked to speak to the manager and he did absolutely nothing. I will never recommend this place to anyone. The service is slow and staff just stands around. You have to ask someone to help you. Overall shitty experience.
"San Soo Gab San has been my go to spot for Korean BBQ for quite a while now! Some things never change. I took a friend for her first experience earlier today and I was still as satisfied as ever! It was super busy but the 20-30 min was well worth it. If it's your first time, I suggest you go on a weekday. That way you won't feel overwhelm and the staff would be able to assist you more during the process. The side dishes are remarkable and the ladies never turn me away when I ask for more potatoe salad. Five stars for SSGS!"
"I have always enjoyed Asian cuisine, especially Vietnamese. I have been going to Simply It restaurant on Lincoln and Belden. The food is healthy, light and delicious. While dining in, I noticed that the restaurant was offering a cooking class and I was so on board.The class took place on Monday the thirteenth at 5:30 pm. I was never much of an enthusiastic student but as soon as they greeted me with such charisma and joy, I was actually looking forward to the class. Though I felt like I was in a convention when they gave us name tags they actually helped bring the whole class together. Wine, beer, soda and others were provided to accompany the food we were going to indulge. We were introduced to Chef Kim once class started. She was very well spoken and attentive to the class, answering que"
Very romantic atmosphere and awesome fondue! Definitely the best in Chicago.
"Burgers are the right price! Not only that they are so delicious, there are fun options, and they don't take forever to come out of the kitchen. Awesome beer list too."
"This place is so warm and cozy and the food is awesome. One can see many celebs in here who don't wish to be noticed at the glitzy joints. The best dishes I've had so far are the fresh fish (salmon), the hash browns are to-die-for, the fish tacos rivaled the ones in Baja and scones with fresh whipped cream are always worth coming back for. The decor is so Bo-Ho and artsy---speaking of art, every few weeks the art on the wall changes and one can actually purchase it. The owner is also very friendly and gives you one-on-one attention---one can't help but be pleased here, not only with the food but excellent service. Being a local Chicagoan and loving food, I give the 3rd Coast the highest possible rating--it doesn't get any better than this folks!"
this is serious ! duck fat fries and elk sausage ! yummy this is the only othe dog i will eat other than gene & judes
This place truly is a chicago gem. Really one of a kind. The best place to enjoy an authentic Chicago style hot dog as well as the numerous other gourmet sausage sandwiches. I like the sauterne duck sausage topped with the truffle aioli and foie gras mousse...TO DIE FOR!! You have to try the fries fried in duck fat.
"While the sushi is fair to middlin' - with an occassional innovative twist and the one-in-while off tasting piece of fish there are plenty of other great places within walking distance.It is with the service that this place really suffers, taking it's diners along for the bumpy ride. Though we have had a pseudo-friendly server occasionally it is the exception. Most present themselves as seeming far too cool for your time and are brusque and, at times, rude. Even if one craves sushi which is accompanied with a side of cool, as I admit I occasionally do, there are far better places that do the cool with a least passing interest in your enjoyment as a diner."
"I want so badly to give this place 5 stars because the hot dogs are incredible. But at the end of the day, I just can't do it. I cannot give 5 stars to a business that hates work. That is just honesty. I really like Doug, but his work ethic makes me wanna jump out a window. They are never open, and when they are, they go at such a slow pace that the line is unacceptable long. I actually think he is doing it on purpose. Like when Playstation comes out and only releases a small amount of machines to generate buzz. No one can be that lazy. They are closed on Sundays and Mondays and they do not stay open after 4."
"This used to be my best kept Chicago secret for sushi, Thai and the like. Since the expansion I had to take a star away. The food is still great but I think they are having growing pains. The dishes I recommend are the sushi regular, seafood madness and the chicken pad Thai. You can't go wrong with any of these. Sitting by the window as you walk in can get a little cold in the winter but that goes without saying. Oh yea! They are BYOB too!"
"Great place for food and drinks. ��I love the decor and service is friendly. ��the mojitos are the best in town. ��This is a great place for goups and special occassions, the latin music has a great vibe and makes you want to dance! ��They never let me down with any of their fish dishes!"
"Yum, Yum, Yum.My favorite vegan 'junk' food!I love the Gyros!Even my meat eating Grandmother, and my dairy drinking brother are overjoyed to share the cookie dough milkshake with me."
Excellent restaurant I really liked the ��flaming saganaki taste was very different but oh so good. We tried the lamb and my wife the fish both dishes were excellent the only thing I did not like was how the small the cokes were what the heck more like a shot would I return? yes definitely great food
Great Cuban and Mexican fare. ��Nuff' said.
"Bad Pozole. ��Maybe the chef or kitchen had a bad day. ��I've actually eaten their pozole before and I was pretty satisfied, but not this time. ��I'm sure even Rick Bayless himself would have been displeased with the way his own dish tasted or was presented that day. ��It's been a while since I had this dish and I've procrastinating to write this review, but what I remember the most about this dish was how salty it was and how the chicken pieces were presented. ��I'll explain the chicken part. ��Prior to this visit I've had the chicken pozole a few times and I remember the chicken being shredded and thus had a more appealing texture to it. ��This time however, the chicken was very chewy and instead of shredded pieces, there were sliced cubes of chicken resembling those found in a can of Cambell's"
"My favorite restaurant in Lakeview. ��Great drinks, amazing food, cozy atmosphere and the friendliest staff. ��The blackened shrimp appetizer is amazing - so are the cod brittles. ��The bartenders make great drinks - love Lisa and another shorter cute girl. Patrick, Bred, Cristina, Debbie and Spark are my favorites in the restaurant. ��They treat you like you like gold - like you are the only patron in the place. ��Love this place. Love it!"
I wanted to get a table here but how....? No one answers the phone. Who runs a restaurant / SERVICE business this way. I say go elsewhere. Someone please call the folks at James Beard to let them know about this ridiculousness's - how did they get a reservation and who bribed them.
"First time at Mastros 4/25/12 for me & my husband to celebrate my bday, the atmosphere was good, food was excellent & the key lime martini was awesome but our waitress Amber was a joy she made our time there that much better, we will be returning but must have Amber as our waitress."
"Couldn't get a reservation on a Friday night 2 weeks ago until 9:30pm. ��Although I tend to get cranky while extremely hungry, I was able to survive on some wine at the bar while my husband and I waited. ��Inside the bar is super intimate, but outside the deck is just beautiful. ��I couldn't stop looking at the landscaping as well as eating the bread and olive oil. ��Our proscuitto pizza was totally covered in proscuitto and I can't remember the pasta I ordered but it was also tasty. ��It's a great place to go at the end of a long week, look good, and enjoy the company with a group or significant other."
"xoco was SO SO good! ��Line was a little long, but it was well worth it. ��Chips and guac had so much flavor and portion size was good. ��i had the ahogada, so delicious. ��It had pork, black beans, and salsa! ��The sandwich was huge. ��My date had the pozole with gunthrop chicken. ��Excelent as well, another giant portion. ��I like that Bayless supports the local farms. ��Something that seems so easy, but not enough restaurants participate in! ��I can't wait to come back as the staff was so friendly and outgoing and the food was superb!"
I have been to Fogo a couple times so far and have been pleasantly surprised. Its not quite the average pizza spot. Alot more choices than most places. ��Very good!!
"Waited 2 hours and 20 minutes in the heat, but it was worth it. ��The rattlesnake sausage with cheese stuffed hot peppers was exceptional. ��It had a nice herby taste to it. ��The Fire Dog could have been more spicy. ��Italian and veggie dogs were good. ��The regular & duck fat fries were nothing special and kind of soggy. �� Next time I think I should stick to the specials. ��Would probably give it closer to 4 and a half stars."
"I keep going back and i didn't think that it was possible but Anteprima keeps getting better. Yes, its loud but we usually go before 6:30 or after 9. The specials with the asparagus salad and the new spareribs on the menu were unbelievable."
"AMAZING! just amazing! wonderful service, wonderful food. better than wonderful food actually. it is just great!"
"I love Garcia's. -- went here for dine-in for the first time today, but have ordered takeout many times before. ��The Ffee chips with 2 varieties of salsa kicks butt. The burritos suazo (with cheese) is enough for two meals! ��The tostadas are great too. ��A little pricier but the steak in the burritos is good. Big portions, Other Mexican restaurants may have little better taste but for large good tasting portions Garcia's can not be beat. ��They've left things out of my orders a few times, and I discover this only when I get home, not wanting to go back and fix things, I settle. ��But that's why they get three stars."
"LOVE Coast. LOVE love love it. ��I always get sushi here. ��Great for a group of friends - wonderful presentation, service, food."
"What an abysmal experience. I can't believe an establishment like this can survive for long. Going for lunch at the Bistro was such a comedy of errors you didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Took 30 minutes standing in line to get seated, 20 minutes of which was waiting for them to bus the empty table. Once finally seated, warned that it would take up to 30 minutes to receive our food. Oh great - nice expectation setting there. No silverware. Asked for silverware for our party of 4. They returned with 2 sets. Asked again. Nothing. Again. Still Nothing. One server for the entire restaurant! Finally got order taken. 20 minutes passes, still no drinks. Ask for drinks. They come relatively quickly after that. Coffee is cold. First my meal comes - turkey with cranberry. Fairly decent. Then two"
"Let me start by saying that I had nothing but high hopes for this place and, since seeing it on Check Please, was more than excited to give it try... even ignoring my fiance's face that said ""what? ��we're going where?"" �� Short story? ��I should have listened.Long story:The food tasted decent... but that didn't make up for the horrible service and the overpriced short ribs.We ordered the beef and the short ribs... the beef was wonderful... but all we got was a plate of beef with 2 short rib bones on it. ��No short rib meat. ��When I confronted the issue with our waitress... she angrily brought over a pair of regular scissors and attempted to cut off a little sliver of something (it wasn't meat) off of the bone. ��Then said, ""Do not eat,"" and walked away. ��Being completely baffled by the situati"
"One this I love weekends is the Hot Doug's Duck fat fries! I always craving for more. The menus are delicious and fantastic. And oh, The Fire dog is so tasty and hottttt!!!! love it!Go before the store even opens because I am sure there will be a line even then.Prices are great and watch out for today's special."
"What a fantastic experience! My father and I went to lunch on a Monday. The service could not have been better and the food was fresh, beautifully presented and delicious! Our server heard it was my father's birthday and brought him a dessert...it was fantastic."
"I used to love this place until the last two times the staff was so rude. The most recent time there was no one waiting for a table (so we would get the next available). The hostess suggested we go somewhere and get some hot cocoa and she would call us. What ??? I am coming there for dinner, why would I go somewhere else to fill up ? The time before that we waited for a table only to watch some other people stroll in and be given the table they had reserved."
still one of the best taco or burritos in town!!
Lots of food for the price. Carne is skirt steak if anything. Had a pollo dish that was somehow watery. Service had us waiting thirty minutes for the bill.
"I saw this on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and decided it was worth a trip into the city. ��There are a lot of good beers, but the food left something to be desired. ��I after seeing the brisket featured on the show, I ordered the brisket platter and was treated to about 8 ounces of pretty dry meat. ��It took a LONG time to get service and for our food to arrive. ��Beers were brought out within about 1 minute of ordering however. ��The rest of our food was good, but not amazing. ��The Mac and Cheese was probably the best thing we had, along with the potato croquettes. Overall, a great place to drink, but service was sub-par and the food is a little disappointing."
"Our waiter disappeared after our orders were taken. All four of us ordered simple pasta dishes with no meat, yet two other tables were served considerably before us. ��Bread was very good and the house salads were OK. ��Pasta dishes were way overpriced. ��$18.00 for watery pasta and marinara? ��Two of us had the pumpkin stuffed pasta. ��The pasta was room temperature and so tough we had to use a knife to cut it. ��A knife necessary to cut pasta? ��That's al dente X 5. ��Overpriced and horrible parking."
"Sultan's Market is a good place to stop in for a sandwich or a really casual meal with some friends. They have wonderful falafel (as everyone has already said), but I've had the chicken and the lamb shwarma wraps and there is just something off about their hummus. It has an odd aftertaste--like...the zoo. I'm just gonna leave it there, but yeah--weird. That aside, the service is good, the food is decent, and this place is quite comfortable."
"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants. ��But on a Saturday afternoon the story changed. ��The young waitstaff was new and more interested in chatting with each other than customer service. ��I ordered the Moroccan crepe rather than my favorite, the Icosium, and despite the menu description, it was spicy hot. My friends confirmed this by tasting it. ��My server assured me she had no idea why it would be hot, and offered to have it remade. ��The second crepe tasted exactly like the first. �� I basically did not eat it, and brought it home, to my gastro distress. ��As we were leaving we heard the table behind us ��also complaining that a crepe was very hot even though no hot spices were in the description. ��The waiter denied it was spicy and the customer kept it. �� I hope this was an anomaly"
"I am going to settle with the 3 stars on this one only because the sangwiches I ate didn't jump out at me and say, ""This is a sandwich with authentic Cuban flavor!!!!!"". ��The location is about 3/4 of a mile from my residence and so the walk is brief, I am very glad to support the place and delighted something went in after Uncle Calvin's BBQ went under. ��Never went to Cal's but I know the officers of the law did.I went to 90 Miles just because my neighbor wanted to go. ��The item that stood out the most was the coffee, I believe it was termed 'Cortadito'. ��Wow! ��Great coffee flavor and only $1.50. �� I remember thinking, ""This is the best coffee I have tasted in nearly 5 months!"". ��With this economy and all, I am back to buying pre-ground coffee out of the can. ��Bitter pill. ��Bitter pill.

"Top Notch place, food is great. The best thing is that BYOB sushi allows you too spend less on drinking and more on sushi."
"I've been trying to find an Italian style pizza in Chicago worthy of Pizzeria Mozza and Otto in NYC same place basically both Mario Batali. ��My girlfriend and i went there on a friday night at 8pm. ��we had to wait 15 min which wasn't that bad. ��We had the Prosciutto and mozzarella to start. ��probably some of the best fresh mozzarella that i've had in Chicago, the prosciutto was just ok. ��as for pizza we tried the mushroom pizza with black truffles and truffle oil and the sausage with basil. ��the truffle pizza didn't have any truffles on it, but the price wasn't $30 as most black truffle pizzas i've had. ��it was fair probably 2stars out of 5. ��the sausage was much better but both pizzas the crust was soggy. ��it wasn't under cooked or at least i don't think it was bc i saw some black charrin"
"Just went to a catered event and found out Irazu was the behind the scenes caterer. Amazing! All foods that were supposed to be crunchy were crunchy, meat was tender not tough. The flavors were just like I remembered from my Costa Rican ��get-away last Spring. If you're looking for a somewhat healthy & unique option to the pasta / American type cuisine for your holiday bash, I would highly recommend Irazu!"
always a great place to relax with friends and drink BIG bottle of belgian beer...and the food is good too. great atmosphere. just gets alittle too crowded...almost always
"My favorite Pizza place in Chicago. If it was not a bit far from my place I would be there way more often. Thin crust is just right. I've tried by now quite a few pizzas and enjoyed all. As a nice final touch you get a decent size cannoli. To be honest, I am not a big fan of cannoli but this one is something else."
"Beware: the owner may ruin your meal and embarass you with very unprofessional behavior!We have been to Spacca Napoli before and have loved the food and the service. The pizza (while a bit expensive) is so good and the wait staff is knowledgable and good with the details.This past Saturday, my partner and I invited friends from the city and suburbs to join us at what we thought was our local gem. ��We called for reservations, were told they would be busy that night, but to come early and hopefully we would get in. ��I told our party to meet at Spacca at 6pm. ��I arrived at 5:45 and checked in and was asked if my party was there (the restaurant was not full at the time). I explained that my partner was parking, one friend was on the train, almost there and two others were on lake shore drive. "
"Burnt cheese ... ton's of toppings.Very, very, very good pizza."
"I have been going to Sunda since it opened and it is definitely in my top 3. I recently had a business lunch here and I am so glad I chose Sunda as the location. The staff was amazing, the food was incredible, and the service was fantastic. I guess they sensed that this was an important lunch, because the manager Kevin sent over crispy rice with kobe beef and mochi for dessert, on the house. It doesn't get better than that."
"The delivery took over 2 hours so we canceled. Apparently it was the last night of the living social coupon, however this was not mentioned when we ordered - if we knew we would have ordered another night. ��Its no fun waiting for your dinner to arrive for 2 hours expecting it at 8pm, and its almost 10."
"Superdawg simply has the BEST hot dogs in the world. There is no way Weiner Cirle or Hot Dougs or UDawg U... or ANYWHERE can compete. This place is amazing. Maybe it's because I grew up eating the food and when I think hot dog I want a Superdawg! My family from CA begs me to freeze them dawgs and overnight them in a cooler, lol. Keep up the amazing food!"
"It is a very controversial topic but I believe Giordano's has the best deep dish. They have an awesome crust and the best tomato sauce. I actually crave the deep dish often. The only down side is that, the rest of the things on the menu isn't very delicious or anything. Nothing spectacular but definitely try the pizza!"
"I have always been a fan of Wishbone and brought guests here when they visit. The food isn't as spectacular as it's sometimes made out to be, but it's typically good and reliable, and the staff is friendly.After my experience today, however, I will NEVER go back to Wishbone again. It was my friend's birthday, and he chose Wishbone for a celebratory lunch. There were seven of us there, and we spent a considerable amount of money on food and drinks, which we could have chosen to spend at any other restaurant in town. But we chose to take our business to Wishbone, so one would think the manager would be appreciative of us and our party. Instead, what happened was that when we pulled out a little birthday cake we'd made for our friend and sang happy birthday, she sent the server over to tell u"
good hotdogs...a bit pricey for a dog but the experience is fun.
"I have never written a Yelp review, but I feel compelled to do so this evening because of the SHEER DISAPPOINTMENT with my meal at Bon Soiiree. I have been 4 times and, before tonight, it was my favorite Chicago restaurant (fun, small, BYOB, etc.), but this evening's meal was really a sad state of affairs. From bland and overcooked dumpling (tasted like something frozen from Trader Joes), to ��very dry and uninspired pound cake, it felt like paying $75 for something that was worth $15. To be fair, as I noted, I loved them in the past. All I can say now is that I sincerely hope the restaurant reads this review and comes up with a menu that is more creative and more worthy of the high price, especially since most of us go for a special occasion. It really was bad enough that I will never be g"
"The pizza is as good as it is in Italy! I took ?my 83 year-old mom to Spacca Napoli and she said the pizza was as good as the the pizza she used to make herself while growing up in Italy. Her family had a forno de legno (wood oven). Jonathan, the owner, is gracious and hospitable. On our 2nd visit, he remembered us and brought over a little glass of prosecco as a little welcome back gesture. Little touches like that make the experience all the better. I was afraid the service would get compromised with the expansion, but everything is running as efficiently as ever. The sidewalk tables are terrific because they're on a sidestreet. Traffic and exhaust smoke aren't issues. You'll never be rushed and the service is always cheerful and friendly.I love the daily specials but what I really appre"
"My wife and I happened to be at Zed451 the night of 8/5, the same time as 4 other reviewers who were part of a party of 30+, so I wanted to chime in. ��We had made reservations a week before our trip, and when we got there, they didn't have our table ready. ��After about a 10 minute wait, they noticed my impatience, and bought us a round of drinks at the bar for our trouble. ��Within about 5 more minutes we were sat, at which point they explained that they had been slammed by several large parties, including the aforementioned 30 top (as it turns out were right behind us once we got our table) and another that was 100 plus, and the parties were dragging on longer than expected.At any rate, the manager was very apologetic, and once we sat, we were given great and almost non-stop attention, and"
"LIke many others, we've loved F&O since moving to Streeterville in 2003. ��However, In the last few years it has declined in so many ways. ��Sorry to see it folding. �� �� Today's experience: �� We've bought ��French jambon madrange (ham) regularly for years. ��But this spring, each time we've gotten it (at the deli) it has been of inferior quality compared to prior years. ��Today it had hard spots (sign of poor quality), odd coloring, open spaces(large holes), and was shredded/stretched along the edges -- as if the meat slicer was sticky, gummy, not cleaned, and had stretched it. We always ask to have it cut thicker, not shaved, so we do notice these changes. ��I think if you accept their pre-shaved stuff you won't notice these defects in quality (they hope?). This pricey ham should be ""gourmet"" q"
"My friends and I were at Boundary ��this afternoon and couldn't watch all the NCAA games there so we went to the new place, Fifty/50 down the street. Supposedly the owners managed Joe's Stone Crab for the past few years, so we were interested.The food and service were amazing. I had the skirt steak sandwich and I think it was the best I've ever had. The cheese fries were also better than any I've had. All my friends enjoyed their food, we watched the games, and had Mickey's 40oz beer all day long. They even give hot towel service after you eat ribs and wings. I have a new favorite place in Wicker Park..."
"I give it 5 stars as well. ��We have been going there since I was a little girl and still love it. ��A Wheeling location is opening this year, next to Bob Chins on Milwaukee."
What a place. Very nice and authentic chinese food. Everything was good. The dried chilis for appetziser was so incredibly HOT it almost made me feel bad in the restaurant. Highly recommended
"Right in China Town Square, this was a great place for lunch or dinner. Went there with a friend on a weekday afternoon. We were seated right away. Had a really good complimentary tea. ��We had fried rice, Three Chilli Chicken, and General Tso's Chicken. The portions were very generous, the chicken was cooked perfectly! Good use of spices and seasonings on the fried rice. The only negatives I found were a dirty table cloth,slow service, an extra charge for white rice and dated decor. But the great meal made up for all those things! Am defiantly going back to try the Peking Duck, heard its suppose to be the best in Chicago!"
"Disgusting. ��I am confused at all the positive reviews. ��First, when my friends, family, and I walked in, the restaurant had this strange aroma of old cheese and funeral home. ��Second, the bread, the bread at an ITALIAN restaurant, tasted like the strange scent we smelled as we walked in the door. ��I took one bite and stopped...I don't think I've ever done that in my life with Italian bread. ��So that was just a sign of things to come...here's what happened next.Over the strange background music that sounded like a haunted house, I decided to split with a friend the chicken vesuvio and risotto with porcini mushrooms. ��Chicken was dry, two of the three potatoes I ate were alright (not saying much because everything tasted bad), the risotto tasted strange and strangely seasoned. ��A friend had"
"Wow truly great neopolitan pizza when I asked the owner where he really learned how to make pizza from he said Italy which is always a good sign. The pizza was fresh with the crust having the perfect amount of char. It truly was a wonderful Margherita pie. Also, when I asked the owner what pizza he reccomends for my list on best pizza in the world he said Keste on bleeker street in ny, I will definitely go check that out."
"Having studied the Mayan ruins twice in Mexico, this food is hands down the best authentic Mexican you can grab. ��Extremely resonable on the pocket book and this place is a ""Five Star - Bang for Buck"" type place.Stop in for a loaded burrito (get everything on it, sour cream, cheese, guac, beans and rice) and you'll have the biggest and best burrito you've had and likely have half left for a rainy day.If you drove ""do not get a pitcher of margarita"" you will not be able to drive home. ��This place is also recomended by your local law enforcement because it is a manly place to eat."
"My Chinese significant other and I stumbled across Lao Sze Chuan by chance while wandering around Chinatown; neither one of us had heard of it so we had no expectations going in. But I've spent a while in Sichuan, and finding a place in the States that can accurately recreate the flavors I got addicted to in Chengdu and Chongqing is not an easy feat. We ordered three dishes, some sort of a cold tofu-skin-and-mushroom appetizer that my companion wanted, and two fairly signature Sichuan dishes: homestyle tofu and kung pao chicken.Both of the Sichuan dishes disappointed. The homestyle tofu had nicely fried chunks of firm tofu, and the flavor of the sauce was pretty close (though missing the flavoring accent of sauteed minced pork that it normally contains in China)...but what is usually just "
"Absolutely phenomal. I've been back twice in one week. The first time I had the seafood caldos (about $12) and it was incredible. I would've paid twice the price for this dish. The ingredients were very fresh and the broth was seasoned to perfection. We followed up with a churos and soft serve, which was excellent. Rick Bayless was also there working hard behind the counter, which was great to see. He literally tasted everything before it went out and was working just as hard as anyone in the restaurant. To say this guy is passionate about his work is an understatement. The second time I had the choriqueso sandwich and instantly fell in love. It's under $9 and is probably the best sandwich I've ever had.This place is probabaly the greatest deal in Chicago and a must-try for anyone!"
"Best restaurant in Greek town. ��Chicken rignati is the best anywhere. Great service, great food, reasonable price."
Although the duck is good...the noodles and wonton dishes are lacking...overcooked and generic...the bbq pork could be more tender.
You had at me at Sausage - a little pricey but truly a delight
"What a great place to experience delicious Italian meals. ��From the pizza, to the gnocchi, mussels and linquini...you name it they make it the best. ��Prices are very reasonable as well as the portions. ��Good bang for your buck. ��Highly recommend them. ��Staff is extremely friendly and accomodating."
"Yeah the pho is good, they also have a hundred other things on the menu. �� In particluar I've enjoyed the raw beef salad (Bo Tai Chan) and the Thit Heo Ram Man which is pork belly cooked in a crock with fish sauce, lemongrass, and chilies. ��Eat with rice. ��Typical for Vietnamese places, a lot of their entries are overpriced.I wish they still wore those camo uniforms."
"Made a reservation at Pequod's for my birthday and the staff was more than accomdating for all 15 of us. ��The pizzas took a while to come out, and they actually forgot to put in our one thin crust we ordered...but absolutely well worth the wait and they took off 50% of the pizza they forgot about...I actually almost forgot the negative experience because I enjoyed the food so much.As for the pizza, it's amazing...from the crispy, caramalized cheese crust to the delicious sauce and endless toppings..it's perfection on a plate. The pizza differs from Lou's or a Gino's, which is much appreciated! It was so refreshing to find a place like this, and not too far away. I will gladly return again and again!"
"Greek Islands on S Halstead is my go to restaurant. Whether dining inside or taking carry-out to eat at home the food is always good. The wine list offers a variety of Greek and non-Greek wines. For appetizers the feta cheese with olives or the taramosalata spread on pita, the dolmades or hot lima beans are good starters. The lamb dishes are very flavorful and so well prepared. The kokkinisto, lamb in tomato sauce is a favorite as are the keftedes. The best way to end one of these meals is with a strong Greek coffee. The service was good..didn't hover yet didn't make you feel lonely. I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant. Simple, beautiful decor and the lightening was perfect..not too bright, perfectly dimmed. Greek Islands is a restaurant with great food, a warm, inviting decor "
NOT GOING BACK! ��The service was horrible and the wait time was too long for what was served. Our order was simple...only 3 items (2 beverages and an appetizer) yet we waited....and waited for it to arrive. We also had to wait for the check and then waited for the waitress to take the bill to get our change. Simply just not worth it! ��90 miles can equal 90 minutes...so if you have the time & patience maybe this place might be for you.
"I have NO CLUE how anyone wouldn't give this place 5 stars! I've lived in Chicago all my life... had dinner many places downtown but this one by far, is thee best place I have had dinner, period!!! I left with my pants unbuttoned and couldn't even breathe.. the food was amazing, 100%! The customer service, which I am really big on, was on point. We were never left alone for a second yet, they still let us enjoy our meal and didn't bother us tooo much.. Nothing was left cold on our plate because they constantly made sure we had fresh sides and warm meat. My card was never red ! So i was able to try just about all the meats, which needless to say, is why I left not even wanting to think about food again ! I was totally satisfied.. the bathrooms were spotless, (which is another pet peeve of m"
"I have only been here a few times for dinner, but I love Wishbone. ��It is so different from the other restaurants I've been to in Chicago and I don't have to dress up. ��The southern specials make great comfort food and the staff is laid back and welcoming. ��The prices are very reasonable and the cocktail prices are fair also."
"I've been here twice and the wheeling location twice as well. the hOtdogs are very very good but the fries are blah-- very oily and soggy. ��Out of the four times I've ordered from superdawg not once were the fries fresh. Especially late night I think they use the old fries that have been sitting in the pans for hours! Superdawg, you claim to be the best live up to it!!!!"
"I cant believe Im just reviewing Xoco now...its funny b/c the first time I went there was earlier this year, right when I had just opened my Yelp account. Months later I have returned, and the quality of food has definitely not changed...if anything its gotten better! My first time there I had the pleasure of having not 1, but 2 tortas! I opted for the Ahogada and the Pepito. The Ahogada is definitely one of my favorites, if not THE favorite at Xoco. It is served in a bowl which the torta comes in, halved and stood upright. Consisting of pork carnitas, black beans, a tomato broth and spicy arbol chile sauce, you are in for a treat. Trust me when I say, you will be repeatedly dipping in this sauce! You have the option of getting it to taste (i.e. mild, spicy, super spicy), I got it very spi"
"My husband and I have been able to indulge at Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil, so we were excited to finally try Brazzaz.The salad bar was, eh, okay. ��The vegetables and salads were comparable to the others, the warm food was soggy and salty. ��The side dishes were different from the what the other two offered.... black beans, rice, and some spinach spread. ��We weren't sure what to do with the spinach spread... there were no crackers at the salad bar? ��The beans were thick, the rice was tasteless and a weird gooey texture.FInally, the meat. ��The meat was all overcooked, and charred, leaving a bad taste in our mouths. ��The variety was slim and most cuts didn't even make it to our table, even after asking the staff (who was an overall-fake friendly and didn't seem happy with their forced smi"
"Best food in the land ! My wife and I went for the third time and have yet to be served a dish that is anything short of spectacular. My only complaint is that our server, Daniel, had zero personality and it seemed as if we may have even been bothering him by just being there.The only way I knew his name was from looking at our check to see his name printed on it as he made sure not to introduce himself but merely said, what do you want to drink ?, what do you want to eat ? and Anything else or the check?'. There is a reason this place has a huge wait,(it's not Daniel), and its worth every minute to do so. Food and wine here is amazing and wont wipe out your wallet either."
"I LOVE THIS PLACE. My father is a Persian and he told me that this is the best Persian food can get. The atmosphere is great. Love the tiles. Long story short, step aside Reza's. Time for a new true Persian restaurant. Wonder when their going to open another location. They've been open since 98."
"Given the prevalence of dining opportunities in Chicago, I found it offensive that they don't accept table reservations. I have dined here before and it is not worth waiting an hour and a half for a table. In short, you are better off taking your dining cash to another place that values your time and allows one to make a table reservation like the rest of civilized society.The hype is just that, hype."
"We came to Chicago as a getaway from Cleveland and to find good Chinese hot pot. Read all the reviews and decided to give Lao Sze Chuan a try. The service was absolutely terrible. Took 15 minutes to get our first drink. Ordered appetizers and the hot pot. The hot pot and the food came out before the cold appetizer, they only brought one drink, and I almost had to trip someone to get their attention. The food was okay, but I have definitely also had better hot pot. In fact our hot pot went almost dry before I could get someone's attention to top up the broth. So with terrible service and okay hot pot, I can't see giving this place more than 2 stars, which is really disappointing, as this was to be one of the highlights of our getaway weekend."
"This is the best affordable pizza I have had since moving to Chicago! ��The slices are generous, and there is always a specialty one for you to try. ��Plus, the coxinha (pronounced co-chee-na) are wonderful.I had been seriously missing East Coast pizza. ��No offense to you native or long-time Chicago residents, but when it comes to non-deep dish, non-superthin crust, I have found it next to impossible to find ��something cheap AND delicious.... and I've tried a lot of places. ��This pizza is not too greasy, and the flavors really pop out. ��None of those ridiculous infantile squares either; pie slices all the way!Plus, staff is very nice, helpful, and friendly."
"Classic.Breakfast.Cool space.Cool staff.Totally cool.Like it.Love it, actually."
"really disappointing. i had heard such great things about this place and was completely let down. ��the service was pretty horrible. we could never even see our waitress because of all the nooks she was able to hide in. ��the cheese fondue was chalky and unexciting. ��the cheese and meat plate was more than standard. just deli counter stuff. ��the chocolate fondue was ok, but i could've cut up some apples and put marshmallows on a plate myself. ��no creativity at all. the only redeeming part of the whole evening was the flamenco guitar player who serenaded us. i won't be back."
Meat lovers paradise!!!! And not to be missed the salad bar! My wife enjoyed the salad bar almost as much as I enjoy the meat-fest!!
"When you are ready to get your serious meat on, Longman and Eagle is the place for you. ��I am seriously in love with the food. ��Seriously. ��Come hungry and early to L&E (they don't take a reservation and the wait can get long after 7:30) but if you have to wait it out it is well worth your time.Waiting to be seated at L&E is not bad because it gives you time to get your drink on at their great bar. ��The bar has lots of craft beers, an ample wine list and a great selection of liquors and whiskey. ��If you are feeling adventurous, try one of their selected whiskey flights, this is a great way to taste some different types of whiskey and get your buzz enhanced at the same time.I like booze as much as the next guy, but the real reason to visit L&E is for the amazing food. ��Make sure to try all "
"If you want a deep dish Chicago style pizza. This is one of the better ones. If you aren't into deep dish, then this is not a place for you."
"I am an avid foodie and can say I have eaten at most of the cities steak houses and have yet to find a place that has it all, like Kinzie. From the minute you walk in the door until the minute you leave, you feel like you have hit all the reasons one goes out to eat. Service is exceptional, there is not a moment that you feel over attended nor unattended. The food is prepared exactly the way you like, whether it is the temperature of the steaks or asking for little to no oil in cooking your fish. The risotto is as good as you get in Italy. As for the desserts, they are to die for, especially the buttered rum cheesecake and the flour less chocolate cake. Definitely a place you want to go to time and again!"
The food is good but the service was very rude. The hosts snapped at us multiple times and the wait staff acted like they were annoyed that we were present. Not worth it.
"Waited in line at 5pm, when opens == table seating does not occur immediately so everyone in line is forced into bar to buy drinks. ��Food ( duck tacos) medium warm, ��bean side dish also partially warmed.. overall-- californian not impressed at all .. Obviously fame has gotten to this place. Oh yeah ��somewhat surly waiter. ��Overall impression, mediocre."
The owner is a nice guy. The service was good. The decor reminds me of Vietnam/ Asia. The food was good; it was a bit Vietnamese American. Most entrees are about $9-15.
"If you like Middle Eastern food, you'll probably like this one. It's super cheap with good size portions of things like lentils and rice for $2, and Falafel sandwiches for about $3. I personally love the falafel here and always have to get it. I tried their egg pie and a friend tried their meat pie. The egg pie looked a bit too oily for me, but wasn't bad (pretty cheesy) and the meat pie tasted pretty darn good (I might have to get that with the falafel next time.). I would have to say the food, price, and the area are really good here. If I lived in the area, I would be a regular.The negatives are that parking sucks in this area. I hate looking for parking here sometimes because it's near the 3 way crossection. ��Another negative is that it lacks of the caffeinated drink selection (There's"
"We were looking for a place that could have good and fresh sea food and not overpriced. Here we found it. We have been four times now, and we will keep going. Nice stuff, cozy place. It has live music on the weekends. pretty cool. I always go for oysters and crab legs. I tried the calamary and the crab cakes and they are ok. But the crab legs and definitely the oysters.....mmmmm. Delish!!"
"I have been here a few times and always roll out after eating because I do not have an off button when the food is brought out. ��Besides being overwhelmed by all the choices, I always make sure to try something new because there is so many tasty treats."
"They have good food - I always get the Fun Noodles (wide noodles) and make up my own dish- brown gravy (they have 3 different gravy's) with onions, peppers bean sprouts, and bbq pork.  I get the small ($6.50) - I just put about 1/3 of it on a plate and can't even finish that! I also got the 2 eggrolls for $3.25 and ate one of them. My total was $10 and I have enough for three servings! If you like it spicy - get the crushed hot pepper in oil- don't know the name of it but use it sparingly.I went in to order and told them I would be back in 10mins. because I was parked in a tow zone in front. In less than 10 min they brought it out to me- Sweet!Must try the BBQ dishes one of these times."
"Just went here for the first time this past Sunday, and felt like I had to review.First off, I would like to say that our waitress was great. ��The place was packed, and she kept refilling our coffee, and making sure we were enjoying our breakfast.My wife was dying to go here, but after the breakfast I am not quite sure what the appeal of this place is.Just a regular breakfast joint in the same ballpark as Frances and Nookies.Overall, 3 stars.Positive: Cheap prices, OK foodNegatives: Too crowded"
this place is soo dirty its not even funny . ��there soup taste like water when i came the other night. I cant believe its always full smh..
"Quality, affordable and kid friendly! Picture a visit at 6 PM, family of four with two young kids. Kids drank all the mango lassie, were allowed to peek into the kitchen and food was delicious. Despite the place filling up, we had great service and full bellies. Next Chicago visit we'll be back!"
"I love this place, I found it after searching for the best Thai restaurant 20 years ago. they make a more traditional Cuisine with fresh ingredients. I am getting hungry just thinking about it. Yum."
Have loved this place since I moved to Chicago. ��It only needs more veal!!!!! ��Sorry PC people!!
I was really hoping this place was as great as it was ��reviewed ��by others - but the service was very slow - and when the food did arrive it was COLD. Prices were high for the kind of service and quality of the meal.
"Recently my friend and I ordered Giordano's. ��My friend made a big fuss about it so I was expecting the best. ��Giordano's lived up to the hype. ��Delicious stuff crust pizza without a doubt the best stuffed crust I have had in the city. ��It took awhile for the pizza to arrive, but it was worth the wait. ��Also we had enough leftovers to eat for the rest of the day. ��I must for anyone looking for good pizza in the city of Chicago."
"did you know ... is expanding their location?did you know is not moving, but opening another location in lincoln park?"
"I was not a happy camper. Point blank, they treated my friends and I like crap. The food took way to long to come out. All of our wine was served with flies. (each independent glass has a gnat in it) When I mentioned this to the manager, she wanted to argue with me about it. That was enough for me. They will NEVER get my money again."
"I moved to Chicago recently - just for a short stay - and friends recommended Gino's as bein really good. ��It was OK, but not worth the wait. ��I'll probably go again and give them a second chance to impress me."
"I love this place! Awesome wings, delicious Bi Bim Bap, and reasonable priced. They have these cool large picnic tables where you can sit instead, and plenty of hand wipes for those wings! Yummy!"
"I've been coming to Geja's for about 7 years, this is my all-time favorite restaurant. ��The service is stellar, the food is excellent and the ambiance is incredibly romantic. ��I've been to Geja's with many people over the years. ��Everyone really likes it, though some wish it wasn't so dark and others are concerned that they will not properly cook their own food. ��I think it is really fun and love the entire dinning experience."
Not much to say about Irazu that hasn't already been said. ��Their food and shakes are awesome. The atmosphere is totally urban. And the dudes running it are really cool. If you have never been here before and are trying it for the first time be sure to get an oatmeal shake. It might sound weird at first - but it tastes great!Make sure to have cash - they do not take cards.
I just love this place. The crust is amazing and there lunch specials are great. $5.00 for a big slice of pizza and beverage of choice (Beer included). Where else in this city can you get lunch for such a deal?
"Went here last Sunday morning with my girlfriend and her sister. The wait was about 45 minutes, but their estimate was very accurate and the food made it more than worthwhile. The menu is dramatically expansive, running the gamut from traditional brunch fare to chicken wings and other finger foods. The ""Hey Ricky"" spanish omelet was excellent and the eggs blackston similarly delicious. And, unlike other reviewers, we didn't have any strange encounters with the owner or problems with the way our waiter was dressed."
My lawd!!! This meal was perfect. ��Get everything on the menu if you can.
"This place is great! Since my previous favorite *weekly* Thai place is dying, I decided to check this one out. I was not disappointed! Food was fresh and freshly prepared. Chicken and fish were prepared to order, not prepped ahead of time and warmed up. Yes, it took slightly longer to be served the entr��es but it isn't fast food after all, and it was worth the wait. Four stars only because they need to turn on the AC. We were there on July 13 and it was cooler outside than in! But, don't let that discourage you. The service was great and the price is right! I will be back!"
"They have the best cocktails in the city, hands down. I am entertained by the prohibition theme and the d��cor inside is gorgeous. I've been going there for years and they even make drinks that are off the menu now, you just have to ask. It's just an out there place that's hard to describe, but certainly worth trying. The only downside is the wait."
"to be honest with you, i been coming to this place for years. ��as the years goes by, the prices keeps getting more and more expensive. ��I know there is inflation but the price is way too much for Mexican food. ��Mexican are known to be good and cheap eats, not this place is all about making money and not caring about the long term client. ��When you raise the price like that, its not about keep up with the pace of food cost, its really just about the owners making more money. �� I know several more Mexican restuarant that is just as good and cheaper, good luck keeping long term clients, you just lost me...... ��but im sure they dont care."
Fake Gnocchi and pre-frozen meals does not make a restaurant 4 stars. Have you looked at LBB wine list lately. ��Poor selection and no bartender. Get it together
I love Sushi X. ��I don't know what I would do without this place because I love it so much. I have been addicted to Dragon Roll after trying it for the first time there. They have very friendly staffs and nice atmosphere and music. I wish the space is little larger but food makes up for it. I strongly recommend this place to any sushi lovers.
"Great drinks!, hate the wait."
Best pho in town! Simply It is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Don't miss this delicious and affordable spot.
"From my daughter's point of viewTwo days ago, for my food expedition that I'm going on with my dad, I went to Tank Noodle. Tank Noodle is a Vietnamese restaurant in uptown. I'm 9 years old and I am a little picky with food, especially spicy food. Remember I'm only nine years old so adults are probably going to like this food. When I walked in the room I took a look around the restaurant and there wasn't really anything very interesting about it. One thing I do like about it is that there are many different cultures and I heard all these different languages. But there wasn't anybody to seat us, maybe the host was just busy or something. They need to make it more interesting and color the walls or something. So I don't really like how it looks but now I'll tell you about the food. ��My dad or"
The food was different but tasty Latin Cuisine. ��I believe the food is overated for the price.The atmosphere was nice and clean. It was crowded when I went but it is a spacious restaurant. I would return maybe twice a year.
"I love this place! I frequent this place for lunch mostly because the food is delicious and the service is quick. The above is not the same for the evening.I will say that I am ��a fan of the service before 4PM anytime after that the customer service downgrades and the quality of the food differs; not in a bad way, just different. My last two evening dining experiences were a bit rough. It took the server forever to come over to the table (it was not crowed). When the server arrived she was annoyed that we did not know what we wanted to order, but how could we know if we never received menus. We ordered drinks, when she returned there were no drinks in hand and she asked if we knew what we wanted in the same tone as before. Food was ordered still no drinks... Half way through the meal, drin"
"I consider myself a well traveled individual. Since i have to China and Japan, I had high expectations for this restaurant. I was mildly disappointed when the host didn't greet me right away. He was on the phone, looked at me and kept talking. I stood awkwardly waiting for a good 3 minutes. Finally an asian girl who may have been a manager walked to the host stand and didn't smile or greet me either. She looked very serious and like she was in her own world. Strike 2. When I was finally sat at the sushi bar, I opened the menu and started deciphering the menu one section at a time. I was recommended the oxtail pot stickers and duck hash salad for my starters. I loved both dishes. I also enjoyed the truffled tuna tataki (sp), I love anything with truffle oil. As I waited for my food, I enjoy"
"Really great place! Fun, welcoming service, awesome food and all at the right price. ��Favorites were the Martinez cocktail, the bone marrow and the gnocchi. ��Draft list is really unique, complete with $2 PBR's. ��One of the best things about this place is the atmosphere; relaxed and fun, good music selection. ��I will definitely be back."
"I absolutely LOVE this place! I've been here a handful of times and never once was disappointed! Food is fantastic and the wine is delicious! I recently discovered they do brunch as well and definitely recommend stopping in to try it out and don't forget to try their bloody mary or mimosa, both delightful!"
"Excellent service!! I took my mother here for her 64th birthday and she loved it as well. I originally ordered a NY strip and asked for medium, but the steak was cooked well. I notified the waiter and I was brought a large filet cooked to perfection in its place. I would certainly go back and recommend Ruth's Chris to anyone!"
"Irazu, Irazu, Irazu! I am always impressed when I see successful ethnic-centric spots like this execute so beautifully. ��With a small, quaint and very comfortable dinning room, you may find yourself waiting for a table, on any given night, not just the weekends. ��Wait. Don't forget to pick up a six pack or bottle of wine and have one on yourself (BYO) while you wait.The patio is a great addition in the warm months, i think it might even double the seating. Service is solid, friendly and comes from the heart (family owned, I think), food exceptional and experience enjoyable.  A must hit for a visitor or local!"
Billy the owner is a great guy. ��He is very welcoming and has done a great job in giving his guests good food in a fun atmosphere
"Best seafood I have ever had! ��A little on the pricey side, but well worth it. ��I loved ��New Orleans-themed oyster bar. Be sure to make reservations or get there early. ��The staff is unbelievablely ��knowledgeable, I really couldn't believe how helpful they were. ��Highly recommended"
The food is not that ��great at all. �� I had better food at ��Ethiopian Diamond it's new so i will try again hope to have a better time .
This place is delicious! ��Be patient as it will take a bit to get seated-it's worth it though! Yum!
"The food here is always delicious. ��My favorite is the panini breakfast sandwich with tomatoes, egg and prosciutto. ��I steer clear of here on the weekend when it's super crowded. ��One star off because they don't have table service. ��I like lingering over the menu - it's too much pressure to decide on my order in the two minutes that I'm waiting in line."
"I truly love this place from the moment you walk in you are greeted by the owner and all there staff.. The food is always super fresh I have been to many Vietnamese restaurants and let me tell you the name says it all Simply It!! I eat there three times a week and my food is always amazing, if your in Lincoln Park try this gem.."
"This place is definitely dedicated to its concept, a metal/prison theme complete with smoke machine and laser show in sync with the concert DVD playing on the wall of flat screen television, tin prison plates, and (perhaps oddest of all) black linen napkins. This place could be cheesy but luckily falls short of too over-the-top.The food was superb and the service was very good. I say this as a guy that has lived around the area for a few years and has been waiting for a place that not only has good burgers, but is as dedicated to ��the idea of the perfect burger as Kuma's Corner over in Avondale or the Rocking Horse in Logan Square. Yes this sounds like a bit of a hyperbole, but I was stricken with love at first sight with the Cruelty to Animals, a gigantic mound of ground beef topped with "
"I think this place is slighty overated. Yes the variety of hot dogs is large and the owner Doug is awesome, but the wait is ridiculous. Honestly card board will taste good after i wait 90 minutes in line. Its a place that one should try once in their lifetime."
One of the best in Chicago.
Came highly recommended by a friend so my wife & I & 2 other friends went early on a Saturday night to try to beat a long wait & try it out. ?Parking's a pain in the ass in that area & after 20 minutes we found a spot 4 blocks away. ?Got there & were told they were at capacity & the wait would be about 90 min. ?I had heard good things & figured it would be busy so we planned on having some beers at the bar. ?We started to make our way to the bar & were told we had to leave the building because they meant the building was at capacity. ?They suggested we try to find somewhere else in the area to hang out & they would call us in an hour & a half or so (same deal for 2 other groups that showed up when we did)....seriously?If you're busy enough to fill your space to fire code danger capacity & 
"This is my favorite sushi restaurant! ��And for guests joining us who prefer not to eat raw seafood there are plenty of cooked menu options that are quite delicious. ��This place is busy - all the time, so plan in advance if you want a table. ��We have always experienced superb service and high quality sushi."
"I liked it a lot. ��The portions were a bit on the small side for Chicago; but the menu is ambitious and the service was great. ��It's a bit to formal for me (cloth napkins in the dinning room), had great lighting, was very clean, didn't smell like seafood and is a place where 55+ years old really feel at home (a bit conservative in tone). ��Our food was good and it would be a great date spot. ��They ��have a menu on-line. ��One of the last places that does not have a TV in the dinning room; but the O bar does and an about five times nosier."
I've been here several times and I cant get enough. I love the duck lard fries. The wait ��in line sucks but its totally worth it. $$$ only
"This food always makes me happy and they do it right here. The lamb in the red sauce with orzo is killer. The lamb just falls of the bone so nicely. The gyro is also solid and of quality, not the greasy ones at fast food joints. If your in the mood for authentic greek go here, you'll be happy. Prices are good as well."
"We had a great dinner here. ��The steak was amazing. ��The staff was extremely friendly. ��They have a really good special currently: ��For $40 or $50, you get a salad, choice of a few steaks, choice of a side and a simple dessert.Our total bill for two with drinks including tip was almost $167. ��For us, that's a pretty big dinner bill. ��We still thought it was well worth it and would do it again on a special occasion or next trip to Chicago.We were a bit under dressed having just came down from a Cubs game at Wrigley. ��Perhaps that's why they sat us upstairs. ��Perhaps not.This was our first visit to a Ruth's Chris as we don't have one in our home town. ��It will not be the last!"
"Talk about an inflated place to go! Not only are the prices really high, but the food is mediocre and not worth it. Our hostess advised us (and the menu indicated) the portions were really big, but we found our steaks to be pretty small. I ordered the $43 rib-eye and only got a few bites of the really good stuff; the rest was pure fat. A really good steak never has to be drowned in butter-it was overwhelming! The kids both got puny steak pieces and a pile of fries, and the price was $26! Not worth it in any sense of the word. Go to Morton's instead."
Went here on Valentine's Day and was blown away by my meal! ��Everything was incredible and the only thing I was less than impressed with was my dessert which was an assortment of chocolate treats. ��Cannot wait to try the brunch here and without kids! ��I love this place!
"Love the food and eat there at least once a week, maybe twice. ��My favorite is the salad bar and the lentils, but the Talapia is awesome too. ��Only suggestion I can make is they consider using chicken breast for the shawerma dishes. ��Too many mystery chunks of fat and whatever else dangles from those chicken thighs. ��Very nice flavoring though...Oh, and accepting credit cards would be nice too. ��Still, I will be there for lunch today or tomorrow for sure."
"This place is packed every time I go! ��They have a huge beer selection and good food on their menu (try their CB&J its delicious!). ��They also have a fairly extensive beer menu, though I'm not much of a beer person it is fun trying different ones. ��I only gave this place three stars because no matter how long they tell you the wait will be for a table, its always longer."
"I've been to this place at least 6 more times since my last review. Every time, there is always something that grosses me out. Despite i LOVE their pizza and beer, I just cant go back there anymore. Couple times I found some whitish slimy stuff floating in my water cup. Yuck! The worst thing about it is that I would notice it after drinking at least half of the water. When I told the waiter he didn't seem to care. Though, he did bring another glass of water after we paid our bill, tipped him and were on our way out.Then, once I have sat on a seat with some sticky brown liquid on it. Double Yuck! I was wearing shorts so the thing got stuck to my leg. I went to the bathroom to wash it off, but didn't complain this time since the complaints don't go anywhere anyway. But even then, I thought e"
"Absolutely great food. ��Xoco was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is pretty much a world traveler. ��When he makes a recommendation, you know it has to be a good one. ��I split the ahogado and their Friday torta special: the grilled shrimp torta. ��The ahogado was amazing. ��I'll warn you however, that if you're not up for spicy food, you should be careful. ��I ordered the ahogado mild and it was pretty hot for my taste buds (admittedly however, I don't have high tolerance for spicy). ��The flavor of the carnitas and the soup that you dip the sandwich in was amazing. ��One of my favorite tortas that I've had.The grilled shrimp torta was very good. ��It came with a black bean type of a paste that had a very unique flavor. ��It was a good compliment to the more spicy ahogado. ��We also had an"
"My wife & I selected Shaw's to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary. We had been to Shaw's on previous special occasions such as New Year's Eve, where we had a great dining experience. Our evening was off to great start when the host wished us a happy anniversary,and escorted us to the booth that we had requested in our reservation. Beyond this point, the inattentive and unfriendly nature of our waitress marred the evening.This server never introduced herself by name, rarely checked in on us, and two times we had to remind her about drink orders that we had placed. The wine, appetizers, and entrees we ordered were enjoyable, but the distant yet abrasive demeanor of this server put an damper on the evening. Needless to say, we were disappointed. ��We'll be sticking to Catch 35 or Hugo's Fro"
"Superb (first time) dining experience from start to finish. ��The fact that service and attention was beyond the doting stage only served to make the diffficult menu choices that much more satisfying. ��Not for the diner who tends to consume similar food groups at every evening meal (I never thought I would enjoy watermelon as part of an entree), but for the rest of us, superior."
"Went on a Saturday at 7pm. ��Very elegant dining ambiance but so dark no one could see where they were walking. ��We started with crab cakes, excellent and fresh. ��For dinner I had the bone in ribeye. ��It was very good. ��I'd say every bit as good as gibsons, mortons, etc. ��We also had the Mac n cheese which was unreal!! �� So tasty and hot, would go back just for that. ��The service was fantastic but infrequent. ��Overall, I'd go back but would bring my night vision goggles to navigate their light free environment."
You pay for the experience and atmosphere. The food is definitely nothing to write home about.
"loved it and will always love it!!i can make my own bowl tastier so i dont get that BUT their wings are SO GOOD!! although sometimes, meat can get dried. i give it a four because it tasted good but i think it could've done better. esp with the bowls. overall, i was amazed ."
"I have never been to a place that is so unorganized. ��The people there who are supposed to serve you have no idea of what is going on and it just seems too hectic. ��I waited over 30 minutes for a sandwhich and a soda, which when the sandwhich arrived, it was the wrong one. ��My friend ordered a basket of Chips and salsa and that arrived 30 minutes later also. ��They refunded my money, with no apologies, exect one from a lady who was cleaning the table. ��The lady who was, I guess the chef, did not even apologize, when I approached the counter and asked for my money back. ��IT'S A SANDWHICH.....HOW LONG COULD IT TAKE. ��I high recommend you DO NOT GO THERE FOR LUNCH, IF YOU PLAN ON ENJOYING YOUR LUNCH."
"Like most other reviewers, Alinea also blew me away. Every dish was beautifully thought out to amaze all senses. The experience including the wine pairings was worth every penny. If I could afford to I would come here for every special occasion."
just spent 15 minutes on hold on the phone. ��3 people put me on hold after me telling them i'd like to place a delivery order. ��crap-tastic service. ��i'll be ordering elsewhere.
"I would give them 6 stars if possibleI first met Kim and her brother, the owners when I was a student at Loyola and they had a modest storefront place on Chicago Ave. ?Can't believe that if was over 25 years ago. Then one day as I was meandering down Lincoln Avenue, there it was Simply It.I was treated like royalty. The wait staff is so kind. It wasn't until I went to pay the very reasonable bill for the tremendously fresh and good food that I realized who the owners were. What a nice re-union. I have consistently ordered delivery for family and friends visiting at home as well as with friends at the office. The other reviewer was right when they said that Argyle Street serves kibblle. ?Simply it continues to simply serve fresh, reasonably priced, tasty Vietnamese food in a warm and welcom"
"I am a confirmed carnivore, but i actually enjoy going to chicago diner. my friend is a healthy eater and at times she goes for periods where she cleanses her system of meat and dairy, so i go along just because we are hanging out. i usally find vegetarian food to be tasteless and uninteresting. but no so at chicago diner. Ilove the black bean burgers and sweet potato fries and will gladly go back to try other items. the servers are really helpful and attentive and i really like that they appease people like me with some real cheese, I got a delicious slice of monterrey jack on my burger.Even if you are not a vegetarian, you should try it. ��--miss positive energy"
"We have eaten here several times. ��We always love it. ��If you want a table without waiting forever at the bar, you have to wait outside. ��I suggest showing up before 4:30 if the door opens at 5:00. ��You should really be there by 4:15. ��But, waiting at the bar isn't so bad if you don't have kids. ��The topolo margaritas are fabulous.I don't think you can go wrong with the menu. ��We always get the Sopes rancheras to start. ��Just get enough plates of these for your party. ��They go down like candy... candy with braised meat on it! ��I can't remember all the entrees we have had, but my favorite was definitely the roasted goat special that is served on Mondays or something. ��The steaks are also fantastic. ��Its not that the sear is special or the beef to die for--I couldn't tell because the seasoni"

"OK, the first thing I have to say about Yolk is YUM! ��I have been here for breakfast several times and everything I've had has been great. ��First of all, you must try one of their cinnamon rolls warmed up for your pre-breakfast. (share it with someone - they're huge!) ��You'll thank me if you do. ��Then, I suggest ordering one of their egg dishes as opposed to the pancakey, waffley syrupy dishes. ��I've found that they named the restaurant Yolk for a reason. ��One bonus about Yolk is that they have those great International Delights mini coffee creamers at your table in lots of different flavors. ��There usually is an over-abundance of the Irish Creme flavor, however, so you may have to steal your favorite flavor from someone else's table.I agree that the service is not always the most attentiv"
Yeah... they just rock...that is all!!!
Sultans Market is a great Mediterranean place if you're looking for fast service and good food. ��They always give you what you ask for. ��I am satisfied every time I eat here. ��I have never tried the salad bar. ��Not that much of a drawback but they only accept cash.
"We went to this restaurant today w/our 2 grandsons; a big mistake!When we arrived, we waited 10 minutes for the waitress to honor us w/her presence. ��We ordered & she came back w/my husband's soup & entree together, no other food. ��When I inquired where the other 3 soups & entrees were, she walked away. ��After waiting almost 10 minutes, my husband finally got up to complain to the cashier/manager. Another waitress came w/glasses of water & then came back w/the other 3 entrees & soup, again, all at the same time. ��There was't enough room on the table for all the dishes!The food was so-so, servings were small & not very tasty. ��And since when do you have to pay extra for rice? ��It was a very expensive meal for what we got.I am at a loss to understand what all the hype is about this place.I s"
I could just repeat everything that has been said good about this place. You want a perfect hot dog experience? This is the Holy Grail. It's nice to see a place done well with a lot of thought and care.Check it out!
"I guess the rents must be high, because Sultan Market is also charging a lot for food! I didn't eat, I just took a couple bites off my friends lamb kebab. The lamb was juicy and perfectly seasoned. There were plently of vegetables and rice and a whole grilled tomato served with his kebab. He also got naan and lots of different yogurts and sauces to try with it. I only ordered hot tea, which turned out to be just a lipton tea bag, my friend got iced tea..both were $1.99 and no refills. So it cost almost $20 for 1 person to eat...too much."
"Insane beer list! SO many to choose from!TRY the Elvis burger! Peanut Butter and Bacon and SO GOOD. I was hesitant to try it but the server (can't remember her name but dark-haired, young, super quirky and easy-going) recommended it and I was glad I tried it.Great atmosphere to groups of friends - even pulled a game off the shelf and enjoyed it during drinks!"
I love this place - the ambiance is amazing - the staff are friendly and accommodating - the price is perfect - the rolls are yummy - the dessert is the best - the drinks are fabulous - i think im going to have my 35th b-day party here! You'll love it - there is something for everyone here.
"Delicious. ��Best sushi takeout I have had in Chicago yet, and the Lava roll is amazing! ��It's not the cheapest take out sushi, but the extra $$ is worth treating yourself on a night in. ��Not a huge fan of the minimalist dine-in experience, so I'd stick to take-out."
"I watched the episode of Check Please!, read the reviews on Yelp, and had ordered pizza for delivery from La Villa a few times and thought it was decent. ��So on Friday 8/5/2011 we decided to have a nice dinner out and chose La Villa. ��We arrived and parked with no problems. ��Entered the restaurant and stood right next to the hostess stand. ��There was no one at the stand so we stood there and waited. ��About 4-5 waitresses walked by and didn't even acknwledge our existence. ��Finally a nice waitress asked us if we were being helped and then seated us at a booth on the bar side nearest the live music. ��When we sat down I noticed that the table was severely slanted and coming out of the wall. ��We asked to be moved to the restaurant side and were seated immediately.Unfortunately, we were handed "
"I've been a regular at Icosium Kafe since it opened. The food gets five big stars, because it's obviously what's keeping me coming back for more. I've been a server for 10 years, so I may be ultra critical of the service industry. Now granted you don't go to a place like Icosium expecting what you'd expect from a 5-star top of the line restaurant, but the little things still count. I went on a weekday with two friends. Two of us order the Crepe de Paris and we asked to add raisins, and my friend added nuts to his. Our server was very nice and accommodating so I want to give her a 5-star rating too. The kitchen forgot to add the nuts and raisins, so our server apologized (she seemed genuinely flustered by the incident) and brought the crepes back to the kitchen. The owner came back with my "
"We've been here twice. ��Once right after they opened and once more first week of January. ��I really want this place to do well, because this area of Lincoln Park (we live a block away) is not so hot for good restaurants. ��The Good:The food is imaginative and delicious. ��I love the limited menu, and minimalist descriptions. ��The prix-fixe option is my favorite way to eat. ��Few decisions, and it makes the evening an event. ��My favorite dish is the octopus, but you will be suprised and pleased with any of the choices. ��Desserts need a little more thought, but the menu is basically there.The Not-So-Good:$60 without drinks is too high to make this a regular destination. ��I understand the quality of the food dictates it, but compared with Sweets and Savories' prix-fixe of $29, Sprout will be sav"
"If you're pizza and beer lover, this is the place to go! They have an amazing thin crust pizza, you can have it red (with tomato sauce) or white (without tomato sauce) and, if you are a big believer in RED pizza ONLY, give the white one a try! You will not be disappointed! And, on top of it all, this place is very affordable! We were a group of 7 girlfriends, we ordered salad, 2 large pizzas, and ��a alcoholic drink each, and we paid $ 20 each (including tip and taxes). Pretty awesome (plus, couple of girlfriends got to take some leftover for their husbands). The only minus was that we had to wait for 45 minutes for a table, we wanted to make a reservation but I think they said we can only reserve for 10 + people. So, bottom line, good food, inexpensive, great beer selection and atmosphere."
Best beer bar Ive ever been to. Enough said.
"Love this place! I read about it on yelp and since it's super close to my old apartment my boyfriend took me here for my birthday.We went on a Saturday and it was super busy! I'm really glad we thought ahead to make a reservation because I think I overheard someone being told the wait was about an hour.. at 7pm. We were seated in the back room, which was slightly quieter than the front room confusion but as our meal progressed the back room also became very busy and super loud. However, the food was so good I am willing to forgive the fact that I couldn't hear anyone, much less our very nice waitress. We ordered the calamari as our appetizer, and you are now warned- it is huge! I was so full from this that I could barely eat any of my pasta. My boyfriend had.. a meat dish that he said was "
"We absolutely love this place. ��Don't try and get in without a reservation as it is usually pretty crowded. ��You really can't go wrong with any dish there. ��Portions are large and every entree includes complimentary pizza bread, soup and salad.Service is always outstanding with experienced servers and the owners usually stop at your table to make sure everything is good."
"FRESH FRESH FRESH food. Hectic and exciting atmosphere...always try something new here, and always enjoy it. Great big bowls of noodels and broth on a winter day."
"If you are looking for a jazz club that hosts fabulous musicians, serves great drinks(although expensive), and has an atmosphere of a club pulled straight out of Al Capone's era, the Green Mill takes the cake! The atmosphere is unparalleled in Chicago. ?A rumored hangout of notorious gangster, Al Capone, the Green Mill continues to provide a jazz club that is a must see.The show I saw was the Ari Brown Quintet. ?It was a quiet show, so no talking was allowed and the staff did not miss a moment to Ssh! the audience.The venue fills up quickly, so there is a chance to get stuck with flimsy plastic folding chairs or just stand.I was told no flash photography while paying cover, but turned out that no photography was allowed.If you love jazz performances and want to feel like you're in a club s"
"Good food. Fun place to go. The waitstaffs is fun. I don't get there as often as I used to (moved out of the neighborhood), but every time I go I am happy as ever."
"This is a perfect place to take people from out of town, and probably is in the top three for deep dish in this city. ��I left a piece in the back of a cab once, and I'll never forgive myself.It's more of a delivery or pick up kind of place, since the area to eat is more like a mcdonalds, but who cares-This stuff is GOLD."
Great pastries! Check 'em out!
Fantastic place in the west loop. ��It's a frequent favorite of mine. ��I think the lunch is better then the breakfast though. ��The toasted sandwiches are the best.
"I was lucky enough to get invited to the ""Pre"" opening last Friday for the investors and was really impressed. Brad Young and Arturo Gomez really pay attention to detail when opening a new restaurant. The decor of this place is phenomenal! A gorgeous sushi bar with a free flowing structure suspended from the ceiling gives the illusion of a school of fish and actual ceilings from Asian temples are hanging on the walls!! The bar is beautiful too. This is certainly a top three restaurant in terms of decor in all of Chicago! Now on to the food and service... The menu has all kinds of Asian flair and I loved all of it. We had sushi which was fresh and delicious. We also had some fillet dishes which were cooked to perfection. The sea bass was the best I have ever eaten and I was told that it act"
I went here on a school field trip with Mr. Becker and it was great. the food was served in an appealing manner and tasted great. The workers explained the dishes that they served and its importance to the culture. I think that their Hummus was amazing and so were the Pitas and Falafels. The only thing i didn't like was one type of their kabab. Overall i would definantly recommend this to anyone who enjoys food that isn't typical with a westernized culture.
"This restaurant is very good. I loved their food. It's the best kind of Mexican food I've ever met. They were cheap too. I think I will be coming here again. The place is always full of people, especially late at night. I like the chips and salsa they give you for free when you sit down. I know for sure I'll be coming back here again."
"We had an amazing time here! ��The food was fantastic. ��Everything was cooked to perfection and had a wonderful aroma that permeated the entire table. ��Our waiter was a polite, attentive man that really knew his wines. ��He suggested an excellent red that went beautifully with our dinner. ��It was a little dry for my tastes, but I'm not really a wine drinker anyway. ��Wonderful atmosphere, great service, and great food."
"Delish. ��I know sometimes it's BYOB, not sure if it's just the weekdays. ��But their food is very good. I LOVE THEIR SAUCES! ��and their portions are pretty large so come with a heavy appetite. ��If u don't do BYOB, don't fret, their mojitos are also super yummy! ��I prefer the squid over the shrimp but that's b/c it's harder to find that type of squid whereas shrimp is more prevalent at restaurants."
"This place was fantastic. ��The owner runs the show in there and he bends over backwards to make all his customers happy. ��We didn't have a reservation, but he found a way to fit us in even though the place was packed. ��The food was delicious- we had the pumpkin ravioli and spaghetti and meatballs, and tira mi su for dessert. ��The wait staff was very attentive.The food was excellent, but the most remarkable thing about this restaurant was how well it was run. ��I didn't see a table sit empty for more than five minutes, but we didn't feel rushed in the slightest. ��The owner was going from table to table and was totally in tune with what was going on with all of his customers. ��This guy should teach a class at Northwestern or something- it really was impressive."
"Their bread is the bomb--so tasty and soft. Most of their food it exceptional and well made. I do a lot of my shopping here. I wish they had a better selection, so I wouldn't have to make two stops. Oh, and they also have wine!"
"What a wonderful place! ��I'm been meaning to stop in for dinner for a while and finally went to one of fixed-price saturday dinners a few weeks ago. ��The dining room itself is really cozy, our server was wonderful and the food itself was unbelievable. ��Out of the 5 courses we had only one minor complaint - ��the pumpkin soup ��could have used a wee bit less cinnamon. The main course (braised shortribs) was supremely tender- the meat practically fell off the bone as I was just looking at them. ��I love the fact that they are BYOB since I am on a budget-plus the corkage fee is really reasonable. ��($5 per bottle) ��The only thing that I think could be improved about the whole restaurant is the website layout, if you've never been to the cafe and try to get an impression off the site its a little "
Love it!!!
"Tonight was the second time I have been to Davanti Enoteca (means in front of the wine bar) and I loved it again.I went with one other girlfriend and we ordered the ragu and polenta appetizer, focaccia bread, squash and bean salad, ?and then we split a dessert (the carrot cake in a jar). ?It was delicious and very different. ?We planned on ordering the swordfish also, but this was plenty of food. ?Things I loved about it:-Our server was great and pointed out things he likes on the menu. ?He was also my server the first time I went here and was awesome then too. ?We ordered something and he told us to skip it because it wasn't that great...... appreciate the honesty and his good tips on what to order.-Loved the music playing...... a great blend of Beatles, Elton John, and other mellow favor"
like yelp said as good as it gets.
"It is a very small place and not a good environment. I had a terrible experience at Sushi-X tonight. ��We arrived there at 6:30pm. ��After waiting 45 min for a table, their manager Michael came and told us to ��""go home"" because there was no tables available, and ��7pm was their cut-off time for their ""happy hour"". ��What kind of a manager sends their customer home? ��Amazing! ��Very disappointed!"
"I wrote a review about this restaurant just a couple of days ago and it has been removed . I find this to be sadder than anything . It wasn't a flattering review but it wasn't a flattering experience so I wrote what happened. All I want to say is good luck purple pig . I hope other people have a better experience there than I did but removing reviews to put up the facade that you are a perfect restaurant is ridiculous . You can still read my review if you check my profile to those yelpers interested . I can see why they wouldn't want the review read because the whole thing was an embarrassment . I eat at restaurants all over the world , and great ones at that . I heard great things about this place but they all turned out to be untrue in so many more aspects than I care to examine . I will"
"Being vegetarian, it is SO important to me to eat tons of veggie dogs in the summer. I used to work a few blocks away & my co-workers & I would stop by on our lunch break almost every day. They have a cute little outdoor area to eat that's hidden from the street, which makes your eating experience way better than street-side. Everyone that works there is friendly & always smiling. I think the owner is taking orders pretty much six days a week, which I find SO respectable.Also the line around the block can seem daunting, but it goes by quickly, don't fret."
"My original review has been removed, talk about censorship. ��My review was not a personal malicious attack on the owners but an honest review and MY HONEST OPINION of what I thought of their food. ��They apparently did not like what I had to say and had my review removed. ��What kind of people do this when I am giving my opinion. This place is awful and obviously not honest when they only want you to see the 4 and 5 stars but can not take constructive criticism. Food is flavorless. Tamales are nothing but mush no filling just one extra dry morsel of pork. ��The Cuban Sandwich, the Pork was dry and flavorless. Plantains were not ripened the day we went, I have had them there before and they were OK, white rice and black beans a Cuban staple, no salt no sofrito and they tasted as thought they w"
"A few years back, fusion restaurants were opening like crazy and were all the rage - Indie Cafe was the best of its genre and is still around because of this. ��The mix of Thai and Japanese food is excellent. ��The sushi is stellar and the thai food elegantly and deliciously prepared. ��Also, for anyone that likes squash curry - this is the only place in town that has it. ��It's a little light on the squash, but is uber tasty. ��The atmosphere is cozy and stylish."
"After a big argue with the owner a year ago, i decided to come back last weekend and such a surprise that the rude owner was our waiter, seems like he is so desperate for money ... but the worst thing was that he kept disappearing into the kitchen, and wouldn't come and check on us, really sad and bad experience, never come back!!!"
"Wonderful food, great staff. ��We had never eaten Ethiopian food and this was a real treat. ��Staff was very helpful in guiding us through the menu and the food was fantastic!"
"I agree with Andrew K. The food is total crap. Fries are the worst I ever eaten. Rest of the food - nothing special about it. They are only have some exposure because of the location. Overpriced, greasy, low quality food. I felt it for two days in my system."
"Great Pizza and even better selection. ��This is the only place in town that you can get any slice, any style (stuffed, pan or thin) at any time of the day. ��If they don't have selection that you want ready and hot when you are up to order you must just not like pizza. ��I subtracted one star because the dining room is usually dirty and delivery time is slow. ��Maybe they are just understaffed and can't keep up with the Lakeview demand?"
"Las Tablas has excellent Colombian food including the fabulous ""Matrimonio"" dish witch includes chicken, steak, gineo, yuca and platano....its excellent! My girlfriend brought me here and it was fantastic....and they also have a full selection of liquor! Very good service....Just too crowded sometimes..."
How can you go wrong with this place? ��This is a staple of Chicago. ��I used to love driving by when I was a kid to see the male and female hot dog statues. ��The fries are to die for and their milkshakes are great. �� Definitely one of my favorites.
We have been enjoying our dinners here for almost 15 years. ��We even had our wedding reception here. ��Absolutely amazing service and food. ��We have been to almost every steakhouse within 2 miles of this one and none compare. ��My mouth is watering right now. ��I must make another reservation now...
I am having a real hard time writing this review. I went with friends based on your reviews.I really wanted to like this place. The decor was very cute. inviting. I wanted a martini but they didn't have my Gin. Our server insisted he could duplicate a martini without Hendricks Gin. i believed him but it wasn't how i expected it to be. They had a table service menu which meant everyone at the table had to order from the price fixe menu. We decide on the fried green tomatoes and gumbo with pork shoulder as a 3rd appetizer. The fried green tomatoes were delicious and the gumbo grand wit a teeny bit of spicy. The rest went down from there. �� The server was trying to impress my friend most of the evening which was annoying. Then again she always gets the attention when we go out. I had a meat p
I am still thinking about the taste of the combo meat Comal and that wasn't the meal I ordered! �� My boyfriend and I had a Group-on for Cafe 28 and we made a reservation early because they were filled up. �� We walked over from my apartment because parking is difficult. ��(side note.. take the Brownline to Iriving Park and save yourself the hassle of parking). ��Our table was ready at the time we had reserved which made me smile because I was HUNGRY! �� Dan read the reviews on Yelp so he was excited about either the bacon dates (Specials menu) or the Papas Rellenas (menu). ��We decided to go with the Papas Rellenas since the dates didn't have goat cheese. �� Our server was nice but wasn't as engaging as I would have liked. ��I ended up going with the Cuban Style Chicken and Dan went with the Coma
This place is fantastic. It has been voted best deep dish 3 years in a row. You can always get a slice any time of the day. As for Jennifer B's review of good pizza... The fact she even mention's Chicago Pizza as being good shows her ��poor qualificatons to judge pizza. I have a feeling she is not from around here.
"I placed my order on LivingSocial using a voucher and moments later, I received an e-mail that told me that my food would be ready in 17 minutes. 10 minutes later, my friend decides to order from the same restaurant using the same LivingSocial voucher. After he orders his food, we wait another 20 minutes before going to the restaurant to pick it up. That's a good thirty minutes and both of our orders should be ready. When we get there, none of the waiters/waitresses approached us to serve us. So we decide to go to the counter and tell them we are here for a pick up. They say okay, turn around and forget about us. So we say it again and the people at the counter are so clueless as to what we are doing and we get ignored again. Then a third time, we tell them we are here for a pickup and the"
"Delivery took an hour and twenty minutes for a single pan pizza. And I seriously live about 6-8 blocks away. Not a great start....Outside of the slow delivery, the food was very mediocre. Mozzarella sticks were soggy. Pan pizza was very blah. I was completely underwhelmed and definitely won't be coming back...."
"Pleasantly surprised! I went with my wife to meet some of her friends for dinner. We got there about 45 minutes early so we went straight for the bar. However, unlike a normal bar where you would see rows and rows of bottles lining the back wall, this bar had rows and rows of CEREAL!!! Captain Crunch, Apple Jacks, Wheaties, etc. I was thinking what the heck is this?!?!?!?!Second, I'm a Miller/Bud Light guy and they didn't have either - strike two I thought.When my wife's friends arrived, we sat down at our table. The first thing you will notice (after the cereal boxes) is the long list of seafood specials they have - good stuff. As you would expect, one of the specials was an Apple Jacks crusted Talapia. This is not something you will see at your local Houlihans, so I had to try it . Botto"
"I hear the food is supposed to be good but I may never find out. ?Had a reservation this past Monday for 14 people. ?We were running late and had our hotel communicate to them we were coming - which they were fine with. ?After driving across town we arrived and the table was given away. ?Then they lied to us that the hotel concierge had said we may or may not be coming. ?We were ok to wait and have a drink but after standing around for 30 min they asked us to leave because we were taking up too much space in the entry. ?Granted we were late but no remorse, no courtesy and outright lieing? ?They seem to be having alot of success since opening and have forgotten that spreading a little love is the best way to be around for the long term."
"I really like it it's quaint but can be ��crowed the food is just simple and good, the place is small."
"The food was all great, but when the bill came it wasn't worth all that. I eat out all the time, so am accustomed to high downtown prices, but this was a little steep for small bites. Save for a special occassion or expense account!"
Steak was Awesome! The service had Great Positive Energy My girlfriend And I walked in 10min before Closing and got treated like we were the 1st Customers of the day . The fresh fruit mojitos are on another level!
"All I have to say is Delicious and Nutritious. ��Check this place out! THe service was decent, as I had an odd waiter, due to his personality, but other than that the food was amazing."
"This was my first visit to this location. With the Randolph street location there isn't really much of a wait, but we waited about an hour at this location. After we put our name in they let you order your pizza since it does take about 45 minutes to cook. I would add about 1 or 2 people to the recommended people a pizza can feed if you are ordering the stuffed pizza. they seem to under estimate it by about 1 o 2 people."
"""Arties"" as me and my friends call it, is one of the best pizza places in chicago. The crust is always buttery and great. The sauce is really good too. I've never had anything other then pizza at Arties, but I would be willing to try something else. It's just too hard for me not to order the pizza every time!Ive eaten there and delivery and both staffs are nice."
"Visited last on May 9, 2010 at 8 a.m.Coffee service slow, ��anxiously ��waited for first cup for 15 minutes. ��Service erratic. ��Orange juice sour, hot chocolate lukewarm. ��Food quite good, e.g. great Nanadict. ��They need to get their act together.Quite expensive, e.g. coffee is $3.00."
Lao Sze Chuan is so great and deserves 5 star. My American took me there. They told me this is really good restaurant. As a matter of fact it is. I like spicy crab and little fish. So amazing. I will come back!
"8 of us joined at Sabatino's to see off a couple flying back home. ��Most of us had not been to Sabatino's before. ��Each and every one of us walked ��out of the dark, comfortable restaurant knowing we had just had a wonderful experience. ��This is no fast food place. ��We enjoyed a relaxed, extended meal. ��So extended, that the couple flying out had to be served early and leave to catch their flight. ��One of us left to take them to the airport and their meal was preserved for him. ��The food was very plentiful and every single dish was excellent. ��The pizza bread starter alone was good enough for a return visit. ��The side pasta dishes were fabulous - my preference was the mostaccioli.If you are fortunate enough to have Max as your server, you will enjoy an outstanding experience. ��Absolutely at"
"AMAZING! I can't say enough good things about this place! ��I went to this bright, darling restaurant with co-workers one day after one of them couldn't stop displaying everything she got for eight dollars. ��The girl couldn't have been happier, and now I know why.The lunch special includes refreshing ginger iced (or hot) tea or lemonade, soup, salad, an egg roll, an entree, rice and fruit. ��Yes - as my friend kept repeating - all for eight dollars! The entire meal was absolutely delectable. ��I had the calamari and its garlic sauce was the perfect subtle seasoning the dish needed.On top of the delicious food, the service was wonderful. ��Our waitress was sweet and attentive and the man I took for the owner couldn't have been nicer! ��I will certainly be back again, especially considering it's "
I alway's believe the first time you eat something is always the best. I've tried the other big names of deep dish and this simply is the best.
"Going here with a love one is a must! The weekend huevos rellenos are to die for. The side of sauce goes perfectly with the beans, tometoes, cheese, and of course the eggs! This place is great and inexpensive. I would also suggest buying a bag of their signature granola -- It's the best I have ever had."
"Took my man on his birthday in this place...at first i was kinda shock because it looks like everyone there are like my parents age or even older, but 1s u passed the bar, then the game is on...WEDNESDAY is the BEST...LOBSTER MANIA!!! OOOOH im hungry now...overall this place is 5 star and the service, i can't ask more...GREAT Restaurant!"
finally a bar without a TV!! Great bartenders making delish drinks. sat at the bar had a couple apps which were equally delish:) a little on the expensive side but i guess you could say it worth especially if you compare to some crappy places that have the same prices.Needs louder music!
"Really great food! Super affordable and decent sixed portions (I split a torta with my friend and chips and we were really full) The best part was their service. We ordered out and they forgot to put out chips and guacamole in the takeout bag, so called them and the manager PERSONALLY drove out and delivered to us even though they don't deliver. Plus he threw in some cookies and was extremely polite, we;ll definately be going back!"
"I've only been in Chicago for a short time, but before I ate here, I've been fairly unimpressed with the pizza. Art of Pizza definitely lives up to the hype. The crust is hearty, thick and flavorful (I got the pan pizza), toppings are thick and fresh, sauce has a great flavor, and it isn't so greasy that it weakens the crust. This place is definitely a jewel in Chicago's crown, highly recommended!"
"My recent experience at Caro Mio has me nearly speechless. ?My family and I were attempting to enjoy the mediocre food served at this Italian BYOB when our meal was interrupted by what I observed to be the rudest behavior by a restaurant manager ever! ?A small group of young (not to mention extremely attractive) men arrived for a reservation perhaps three minutes late. ?Upon their arrival, the manager ignored them for 10 minutes as he instructed waiters to dismantle their place settings at a table. ?He audaciously and smugly blurted out to them that their reservation was canceled. ?It appeared as if he had done so out of some power-drunk, antagonistic spite. ?The restaurant was half full too! ?The young men attempted to plead their case; however, the manager pointed at the door and told th"
"The small amount of seats and the wait after 11a.m. leaves much to be desired (averages about an hour) but the food and service is amazing. Doug is a sweetie. Kind of reminds me of Elvis Costello. During the work week you can place an order by phone, pick up your food, and bypass the line!"
Great bbq. ?Pricey. ?Almost worth it.More specifically: delicious bread & butter pickles and potato chips brought to the table with the menus. ?The potato chips are very crisp and salty. ?We'll get back to salty in a moment as it's a keynote taste at Q.There's a bit of sticker shock at the prices - about 2x - 3x what I'm used to paying for bbq. ?The server's introductory speech made reference to raising the standard (or bar or something) by using extra-special ingredients. ?That these ingredients justify much higher prices was unstated but strongly implied. ?My wife and I figured we'd order basic items and add others if we were still hungry. ?We split a lettuce salad. ?There was enough that we each got a large soup bowl of salad made with fresh greens. ?I had a pulled pork sandwich and fri
"Late evening of July 22, 2011 I took my European guests to Chicago's European bar to show high quality of US restaurants. I was always proud of this bar, and I was always bringing my friends here. ��I liked Hopleaf because of good European beers, and go here often although it is little expensive. I will never visit this place again. This time it was a disaster. ��Food here is just so so. ��French fries here are always burned, bitter and extremely salty. I don't think that anybody can eat this kind dark brown fries. This bar supposed to be open 'til 2AM. The rude guy forced us to move from restaurant to bar at 0:30AM. Then it turned to worst nightmare. This guy was putting chairs up on table around us 55 minutes before closing time. The guy was telling to my friend before closing time 45 minut"
"I came very close to giving it 5 stars; this place is very good. ��For starters, the idea of a French-Vietnamese restaurant, while not entirely novel, is definitely intriguing and delicious. ��The restaurant's atmosphere is one of my favorites in all of Chicago. ��Intimate, yet inviting; elegant, yet relaxing. ��The service is also tremendous and accommodating. The food is equally wonderful. ��The menu is exciting: oxtail soup, ribs with lemongrass, great seabass, and filets. ��I personally enjoyed a delicious duck entree."
Best mexican restaurant in the city... their chiminichangas are unbelievable!
My first time trying anything Ethiopian was at Demera on Lawrence and Broadway in Chicago. I love food so why not...I went in with friends and we each ordered something different and agreed to share to see who ordered the best food. The service was good. They have an assortment of beers including a few Ethiopian selections. I had a native beer and didn't hate it. Nice actually!The food was served with a pancake type of bread that you use to scoop up your food with. I loved it! The servings were very big so bring an appetite.
Best Italian in Chicago...hands down.
"Although in a prime location...this is NOT the Gino's you want to eat at. ��When you walk in the door employees yell at you to sit and tell you where to sit while you wait for a table. I along w/other customer could not believe the treatment. The service was horrible. While I was eating my salad, the waiter came by and asked if I was finished but didn't wait till I answered and instead just took my plate...This was by far the worst pizza experience ever. ��I will eat at Ginos again, but never this location. ��The one star is for yummy pizza."
"Among all the Brazilian Restaurants downtown, this is my favorite! In their salad bar you can find the most awesome risotto I've ever tasted! They have a lot of meat selection and just like what they say in the rest of the reviews here...they really excel when it comes to the service, ambiance and of course the food. That's why whenever we have special celebrations in our family...we like going here! The only thing that kept me from giving them five stars is their parking. I know parking is discounted but, it still a lot!Anyway, try this place and for sure...you will come home happy and full!"
"I go to Depaul and the food sure does get boring around here. I decided I wanted something different. And Simply It, simply did it for me. I ordered the lunch combo for pick up. The person on the phone told me 10 to 15 minutes but I did come in before that and my food was already done when I came in. The food was delicious, fresh, healthy, and pretty cheap. How awesome can it get? The person at the counter did tell me that they take reservations for group lunches. Sounds really good to me. I will have to come in with my friends one of these day."
"One of the classiest restaurants in Chicago. The service is a bit slow, but I don't mind as I enjoy wine and good food. I've had the fish a few times and it's always excellent. The salads are very good as well."
"Irazu is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. ��I always get the same thing because it's so delicious-- the steak casado, which is steak and onions topped with a fried egg, with a nice vinegary cole slaw, rice and beans and plantains on the side. ��I also love the shakes-- I usually get mora, which is blackberry, made with milk. ��The place has a nice homey feel and it's family-run so you will see the same guy, Henry, at the cash register pretty much every time. ��The only bad thing is that sometimes there is a long wait since it was featured on Check Please a couple of years ago, but it's definitely worth it!"
Just went there this past weekend for my first visit. ��There was no wait on a Friday night and we had a nice seat in the bar area. The band was great--not too loud or overpowering. Everyone in my party of four had something different and we all loved our meals. I highly recommend the gnocci and gorgenzola! The lobster ravoli was also a hit!!Desserts were a bit small portions compared to the large dinner sizes!
"Absolutely the best burger I've found in Chicago. Amazing. The ""Gruntburger"" is the best: fried onions and blue cheese. OMG. They will split your burger for you if you want, which is really great for two people (it's a 1 lb burger). ��Also, they have great attitudes and make you feel comfortable. If you strike up a simple conversation, the bartenders will remember you the next time you go in. Just a really great place. It's definitely worth searching for a parking space!"
The Agripolitan is by far the best cocktail I have had in Chicago! Food was amazing too!
"Ok, I'm a big italian food fan. ��Most places in Chicago go for more of the American version... enormous servings, cheese galore and sauce, sauce, sauce. ��I was surprised and happy to find this place. ��A thoughtful and deeeeeelicious approach to country italian. ��We almost passed out from the number of dishes we had to try. ��Our friend, Jackie, turned us on to the place (THANKS!!!!). ��The pate was so fluffy and light it had a mousse-like quality. ��The polenta was to die for AND the grilled octopus completely blew me away. ��GO TO THIS PLACE if you want great food and a fun, casual atmosphere."
"Going to keep this short and sweet. We decided on the tasting menu, because we couldn't make up our mind with what to choose, and:OHMY GOD. Best meal of my entire life. Bacon wrapped dates, croquettes, and everything else on the menu was phenominal. Would recommend this place in a heart beat. Wish they would open this in NYC"
"WOW not your typical BBQ joint. My boss took me there for lunch one day and let me tell you I was surprised. Kobe Brisket was very very good. Your meat of choice comes with all three of their bbq sauces, personal favorite South Carolina. Definitely go to this place if you love BBQ. Be careful, can get pricey. French fries, chips, pickles EVERYTHING IS MADE IN HOUSE. Try try try"
It was a pretty cool place. ��We waiting in line for about 20 minutes due to the popularity of the restaurant. ��Our food came out fast once we sat down. ��I ordered the eggs benedict. ��It was a unique taste!
"OK...where to start? I guess with the food. �� I have to say that everything we ordered was really good...I probably would have even had said delicious if half of what I ate wasn't cold by the time I got to it. ��The menu consists of four sections: Appetizers, Salads & Sandwiches, Plates (similar to Tapas as the server explained) and Entrees. ��We started to order a few appetizers and we were informed that the kitchen likes a complete order from the table since they were small in size. ��So...OK we went back to our menus and figured out our entire order. ��We ordered a lot of the Plates which we were told were meant to be like tapas and a couple of the sandwiches with the intention of sharing them all (and our server was aware of this). ��A little bit later our food was brought out all at once.."
"My wife and I arranged a graduation party for our son at Calo Ristorante. We couldn't have asked for a better venue, more attentive service, such wonderful food or more generous beverages than what Saqib and his staff provided for us. We recommend them without hesitation. This establishment will be a must stop whenever we're in town."
"I came here for dinner for a business dinner not too long ago and I have to say, it was pretty good. I have been to Fogo before, and i have to say, they are a little better. Service could be a little faster, but all in all, it was a good experience. Nothing to impress clients, though."
"Great place..good atmosphere...really good food. ��It's not cheap but worth it.Try the chef's tasting menu. ��Really good, lot's of courses, it's about $50/person but you get so much high quality cuisine. ��If you order individual tapas it will cost more for less.Lunch is great there also and cheaper.One of my favorite Chicago restaurants"
"This place is terrific! We had reservations for five that shrunk to three on the way to an 8:00 pm, Friday night reservation. Upon arrival they were very accommodating and didn't miss a beat. The food was great! The appetizers were very different and despite there exoticness (pickled hard boiled egg) they were really good. They prices may have been high but the experience matched the price and then some... Kudos!"
"Had brunch here this weekend. Really good food, a little pricey for bacon and eggs but I dont recoomend getting something that simple"
"I absolutely love Greek Islands! ��My sister and I frequent this place and I must say they have never disappointed me with service or food. ��The atmosphere is laid back and welcoming from the moment your car is taken by valet. ��After walking in, you are immediately greeted and seated. (note the rhyme) ��The infamous bread and butter comes out to keep you company while you decide (from the awesome menu) what it is you want to eat. ��One of my personal favorite things to order are the meatballs. ��They are a mixture of pork/beef and come with this very savory sauce....get these as an appetizer and you will definitely be pleased!!!"
"3 experiences to review and they are not pretty. First time I walked in for Lunch during the week and the bar had probably a total of 6-8 people in the entire place and was fully staffed. Ordered an appetizer from the bar and took it to our table where our server took our lunch order along with the drink order. Long story short, We finished our appetizer and received our entrees before we even got a glass of water let alone our first and only order of beers. Now it would be totally different if the place was packed and the server was in the weeds, however it doesn't help the servers reasons when he is parked at the host stand the entire time we were there. Hey off day no biggie right....WRONG! Next time I go in is with my uncles on a Friday night. My uncle orders a Stoli & 7up, observes th"
love the food way over priced!
"I visited Shaw's and was a little disappointed.First off our waitress was a little rude and we felt rushed to order. ��The server assistants however did a great job at making sure the table was bussed.The $18 sushi roll was a joke. ��It was filled with virtually nothing and had hardly any flavor. ��My $15 fish taco was also flavorless and one of the fish tacos was filled with fish bones. ��I mean I know it's a fish taco, but come on.The oysters were the shining moment of the meal. ��I usually cant stand oysters, but Shaw's had a huge variety and they were very very good.All in all after an over $200 bill for 4 people I was a little upset. ��I don't mind spending money on an amazing dining experience with amazing food. ��But for what we got it was not worth the price."
I am new to the neighborhood and was pointed by a coworker in the direction of a nearby breakfast spot on Taylor for Sunday Brunch. The place was small and absolutely packed so my girlfriend and I wandered up the street towards another breakfast restaurant when we passed Davanti. The doors and windows were open and music was playing. 10am on a Sunday for what I had heard was a relatively new Italian restaurant? We popped our heads in to check it out. For the next 3 hours we ate and drank our faces off. Soft scrambled eggs with fresh black pepper and pecorino. This breakfast calzone as big as my head. Some cheesy bread and egg dish in truffle oil. The bloody Marys were good. The mimosas were delicious. We came in with no expectations and left extremely full and very satisfied. I was pleasan
Delicious! Try the mango beef or roasted duck curry!!!
The fact that this place offers such a diverse menu while maintaining quality and yummy flavor is pretty amazing. This is definitely a favorite brunch spot I regularly take out of town guests to so they can get a feel for Greek town. ��The only complaint is that it can get super crowded on weekends...but it is worth the wait and crowded seating. ��Week days are much more relaxed and enjoyable. ��Try it!
"I have been going here for years now, and love this place! Everything is great here, especially the Huevos Ranchearos on the weekends! The have amazing chocolate cherry oatmeal cookies that are pretty great as well! You will not be disappointed, this place is great!"
"Mayan Palace is by far my favorite restaurant in the city.I grew up on Mexican food in California and I was a little worried about not being able to find a place in Chicago that was as good as the food I'm used to. ��When I went into Mayan Palace for the first time, I was a little worried because the place looked a lot fancier than the awesome little places I'm used to. ��After one bite, I was so happy I gave this place a chance.My boyfriend and I go to Mayan Palace at least twice a month (sometimes up to once a week when the weather is nice!). ��The food is amazing. ��The chips, salsa, and guacamole are amazing. ��The service is awesome. ��I can't say anything bad about this place. ��I love Mayan Palace."
I am a Vegan and it's hard to find a good vegan resturant. The food here is good but not the best.
"I had been trying to get a reservation at Schwa for over a year. ?I surveyed the net for the best times, set myself daily phone reminders to call, and on occasion even tried to stop in to see if there were any openings. ?All were to no avail, until last night when I finally got through. ?Carlson: ?This is SchwaMe: Can I make a reservation for six peopleCarlson: Ya, when would you like one?Me: ?I will come in whatever day or time you tell meCarlson: ?Come in right nowMe: ?Definitely, on my way. ?After celebrating, contacting the rest of my party and making a well orchestrated alcohol run I arrived to enjoy the fruits of my labors.Before I go in any further, it must be noted that I knew (and looked forward) to the unconventional experience chronicled by many I know who dined at Schwa. ?I und"
I have been going to this place for over 30 years. The Salsa Verde is not as hot as it used to be but the tacos and Burritos are the best in the city.
I really love the feel of this restaurant. When I moved into the area the Realtor told me to check this place out. Then at a gathering I couple of friends told me that it was really the best Restaurant in piles... I had the Chicken Fajitas. They were excellent. I especially loved the corn shells instead of flour. The only thing that bothered me a little was that it was really packed on Sunday buy totally understand. Don't ��miss this place. :)
"If you know Chicago you would know that places with the physical characteristics of La Pasadita are a dime a dozen. ��It seems that on every single street corner there is an authentic looking Mexican Restaurant. ��Out of all of the, Pasadita is the best. ��From tortas to burritos to just plain tacos, you can't lose. ��Plus they know how to serve a real steak taco with Cilantro and Onion only! ��Only downfall is the place always just feels dirty and the bathroom is just plain scary."
"Ok so I may be a bit late on writing this review and I may not exactly be a chicago deep-dish expert but this pizza has remained and I feel will always be in my top 3 or 5 pizzas of all time (and I just got back from Italy this summer and had the best pizza of my life). Oh and btw, the pizza in NYC I had will remain in the bottom 5 of pizzas I have had of all time. Not what I expected at all! =/ That being said, this pizza is so unique but so good and delicious at the same time. Yes, it does take about 45 minutes for them to make your pie but I would rather wait 45 minutes than wait 10 for some pre-made pie thats sitting under a warmer. At leas you know your getting a fresh made-to-order pie! Just plan ahead or order an appetizer to tie you over. We ordered the sausage pie which had a comp"
Really fabulous food and ok (not great) service. Could use a better system of taking names on a busy night when a lot of people are waiting for tables-- Boss man was very crabby asking us first to 'leave' as we followed their sign which indicated we should go inside to give our name .....he didn't want us to go inside but rather to wait outside (on a warm night) for someone to come out to take our name... But we'll go back -- food was one of best Chinese in Chicago that I've found
Just visited Chicago and had to try Xoco (Rick Bayless).It has potential but he needs to take his hand out of the salt jar! ��The posole soup was way too salty! ��Along with the specialty Xoco salad! ��The torta (mushroom/goat cheese) was good. ��We tried Frontera Grill ��the night before and it was really delicious! ��I think that's why I was so disappointed with Xoco.
cool vibe. ��along the same line as purple pig and gilt bar in downtown. ��Love the cocktails. ��a great stop in logan square
"Hello, I am writing a review of the Wilde restaurant. ��I went to the Wilde restaurant on Friday and it was okay. ��There was a line but it was not too long. ��I had a beer. ��The beer was a little too cold, but it tasted good. ��Way to go Wilde!We got a table that was small, but cozy. ��There was also a big menu. ��I don't know about Shepherds pie, but I did not see any shepherds! ��Ha ha. ��I had a burger, it was a tough burger. ��Janet had pasta--yuck! ��Garlic. ��But yum for the salads, delicious! ��Bacon and cheese, I guess are not a salad, but tasty!The bathroom towel paper zooms! ��I dried my hands.So the food was okay. ��Wilde restaurant is a very big place, dark and full of oak wood! ��There are books, Oscar Wilde wrote books, and a fireplace. ��No fire, though, spring is here! ��Ha. ��Janet liked t"
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE NUEVO LEON.I've been going there since I was little.Whenever I become extra hungry and I want to be full...that's the place I go to.That's the only Mexican place I will eat at. It's GREAT for family get togethers.
"i love this place! the cocktails are so original. i thought the ice specific drinks were a bit pretentious at first, but after a chat and sample with the owner i realize my first inclination was completely wrong. also: the water is the best water ive ever had. i know its ridiculous. but honestly. best. water. ever. the interior is way chic, super speakeasy like. must try peanut-butter-banana-whatever-they're-called."
"Went to the Purple Pig on Friday night with my girlfriend. When we got there around 7:30pm, we were told that the wait time was approx. 1 hr (note: they do not take reservations). We decided to get a drink at Watershed (Ohio and State) in the meantime. We went back to Purple Pig after about 45-50 mins, and were seated a bit early. The place is not as loud as other reviews say, and we didn't mind close quarters because the atmosphere was relaxed and fun. To start, we ordered a bottle of Cote du Rhone, which was reasonably priced, and the sommelier was hysterical (but knowledgeable). The first dishes we ordered were the roasted bone marrow and brussel sprouts. Keep in mind I would never have ordered bone marrow in my life had I not gone into this dinner with an open mind. The bone marrow was"
"Been here a few times. ��Average food, good salads and appetizers, ok service. ��It's a good spot if you are looking for a huge variety. ��The atmosphere is the best thing they have going for them"
"This place may have fallen victim to it's own success. ��I used to eat here whenever I hit Chicago in the late 90's and I'd rave about it wherever I went.I've been going back lately, and I considered another meal at Giordano's unfinished business.The pies are still first-rate; fantastic crust, thick as dessert pies and loaded with cheese and savory toppings. ��But the experience overall was really damaged by the service experience, which has devolved to that of a really busy roadside diner.Giordanos is crowded - people love the pies and if you go, count on a long wait. ��This bothered me not at all, but to be hustled from the front door and deposited in the to-go line and rushed into ordering in assembly-line fashion was pretty lame. ��The staff is harried and impatient, and they are so motiva"
enjoyed the drinks food was okay
"Just wanted to give a shout out to one of the new waiters, Nic, who made the high price more bearable. Admittedly, our bar bill was double the food tab; we had two Absinthe & two Death's Door martinis. ��Excellent cocktails, worth every cent. As for the food: Mac n Cheese and Sweet Potato fries, definite B. The decor is elegant and warm. ��Maybe when I get a job ($$$) I'll go there to celebrate."
I like this location a lot better than the one on ��Western simply because they still have the cheaper old menu. They also have the best margaritas I've had in Chicago and only $6.50. Great food.
"The visually disjointed interior doesn't match the incredible food. I was told a friend of the chef who is a chiropractor wanted to be a designer and had done the space. The young staff were knowledgeable, pleasant, and attentive. I ordered three courses and all were amazing. I'll be back for the incredible food. A shame the overall aesthetic fails to meet the high bar set by the talented chef."
"My first impression of nueva leon was excitement. It had a very lively atmosphere and everyone seemed to be enjoying the food. I was a little discouraged about how dirty it was. The floor was very greasy and I almost slipped a few times trying to walk on it. The dishes were not very clean and the table had crumbs on it. The nachos I ordered were presented very nicely but the chips tasted very awkward, like the tortillas had been fried in old oil. The chihuahua cheese dip was very tasty along with the tacos. The meet was a little stringy for my taste and not as tender and char grilled tasting as I am used to having with carne asada. The meal was alright but nothing to absolutely rave about. I got home that night ��and had stomach cramps, the next day I was not feeling well, low and behold I "
Nice selection of beer. That's why I go there.
"The vegetarian burrito, all 6 glorious pounds of it, will make you want to become a vegetarian full time. YUMMMM!!"
"My friend and I have heard a lot about Hop Leaf and wanted to try it. We were there on a slow Monday lunch. We sat ourselves, waited for service and nobody ever came.. The bartender told us to sit anywhere so I assume he was suppose to take care of us but completely ignored the table. He only had 2 patrons at the bar and was on his phone for most of the 10 minutes we were there. We walked out and will not return."
"Hands down, my favorite place to hang out with the guys after a night out. Its great that they are open til 1 am. Love their Nescafe frappe and raspberry mouse cake. The service here is always so pleasant - especially the Romanian waitress with short black hair. A sweetheart."
I can keep this short and sweet - I loved Gibson's and I loved Joe's but now I LOVE Mastro's. ��Melt in your mouth steaks and seafood. ��Unbelievable! ��MJ and Kerry as servers are entertaining and hospitable.
"My wife and I just moved into the neighborhood and have walked by the restaurant several times. ��It looked very charming from the outside so we decided to give it a try. �� The interior is very nicely done. ��The food was fantastic so was the service. ��The owner of the restaurant was very polite, personable and attentive. ��He was walking around giving everyone in the place a shot of, well, I don't know what it was, but it was strong. ��Everyone in the place was having a great time. ��I'd recommend this place to anyone. ��It's a gem."
"To Nick the waiter. Next time a group of people come in after the Ovarian Cancer walk don't ask if "" anyone caught cancer at the walk?"". Chances are that there is a person with cancer at the table (there was) or cancer has affected the lives of the people you are about to serve. If 18% gratuity was not already included in our bill ,this is the only tip I would have given you. You are an idiot."
"I've been coming here for over 3,000 years, so I feel particularly qualified to pass judgement on this establishment. It's truly heart-warming to think back to the days when Sultan's was a decrepit little corner shop offering a full selection of canned goods. How far they've come. In general, the outstanding quality has remained despite the increased attention to the glamorous surroundings, but I do have a few complaints. 1. Food servers and cashiers: you don't need to fake like you've been dying to see me since I last came in a month ago, but at least say something to me. Or grunt in my direction. 2. The assembly line operation that Sultan's has become is indeed a marvel of 20th Century industrial science, but just as with Ford, more ends up being less. The quality of the now mass-produce"
"We decided to go to Coast on a whim on a wednesday night and as we walked through a silent bucktown we got a little nervous that they might have closed ealry. Wrong! this place was packed and thought we had to wait 10 minutes for a table it was worth it.The sushi was top notch, I have not had better in a very long time(try the eel, volcano, and wasabi rolls) . It was also affordable; we had 7 or 8 rolls of sushi for the four of us and our bill was under $90. The BYOB policy didn't bother us either. We had two bottles of wine and they lasted just fine. so why only 4 stars? the service. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't terrific. All in all a great time, great food and worth the trip."
"I went to Hot Doug's for the first time a couple of weeks ago and it was amazing! I didn't even get one of the exotic dogs, I got a regular steamed hot dog with mustard, relish, and onions. It was delicious! I also had the cheese fries, YUM! I tried the Duck fat fries too, which were also tasty.It is so cool that they have different kinds of sausages every day. Even though there is a giant line every day, it is totally worth it!"
"1st time I came here, I was in love. ��Only mar to the dinner was a not-so-good beer, and very limited/nonexistent wine list. ��Since, no meal has quite lived up, but still excellent. ��Kinda pricey. ��the menu & the concept seem to have changed multiple times - I'd expect the menu to, but the concept went from eclectic with a strong shot of Southern to almost exclusively Southern. ��FABULOUS corn bread. ��Atmosphere will carry off a special event dressy dinner to casual meeting friends. ��The brunch has been getting a lot of press, but I've only been for dinner. ��Knowledgeable helpful wait staff."
"This is a really unique place. ��Came here last night with some high school friends and didn't think of having to wait at all on a Wednesday night, but there was an hour long list ahead of us. ��We stayed and it was worth it. ��Although I'm not a vegetarian/vegan the choices of awesome things to order were plenty. ��The Reuben was amazing and I orderded both sides of the spicy black beans and kale salad. ��The spicy black beans were definitely tasty. ��My friends ordered the avocado tostada and black bean burger which they both were happy about but I think mine tasted the best. ��We ended up going through facebook on our iphones about old high school people, reminiscing on the good and the bad for awhile and there was no rush to move us out of the table. ��Good times!"
"In terms of steak places where you can stuff your face, this is it!I loved everything at the joint. Hardest part is not stuffing your face too much! ��I need to wear sweatpants next time I come here! Good job fellas!"
"I love this place, them dipping sauces are the best. ��Great place to take a date, but they can be busy. ��Food is great and did i mention the dipping sauces are great. ��Food is just wonderful, and staff is great and kind...all the thing i look for a restaurant."
"I had some coxinha, totally awesome!!!Oh and they also carry pints of Bobtail ice cream!"
"On the weekends we like to drive into the city and hang out with friends and boy are we glad we walked into this place!They have a colorful and cozy little place with this awesome outdoor enclosed and heated seating section decked out in lights. The best part is that they're BYOB. I went with the Casado, a delicious dish with grilled onions on a bed of Costa Rican rice and a cracked egg. That's right, juicy yellow egg goodness drizzling on my rice and plantains. And it's $12. A giant plate of meat and grilled peppers, onions, rice, egg, plantains and cabbage salad. I want to go back every weekend!"
"YELP REMOVED THE REVIEW BELOW FOR SOME PHANTOM REASON SO ILL SAY IT AGAIN. ....ok well totally bummed that i just wrote a fantastic review for Lockdown and it got lost in yelp waste land.So now it's a quicky note. ��I ��had a great experience here with my hubby. ��so much that we were back the next day for more of the same. ��the burgers are phenom and the room is a must see. �� if you like burgers.... don't waste your time going to the ""other place"" ��go to Lockdown and get the ultra-burger experience. �� ��I really wanted to add more to that review because a review on this place deserves detail. ��But I had already given the previous review ��that was mysteriously lost in yelp wasteland heavy detail and then there was no time to rewrite. �� Let me underscore....

A steakhouse with budget options but a connosieur's atmosphere. ��Well done! ��(Or medium rare)
"Frontera Grill .... ��What to say, can't explain how it was a great meal we got there. ��There were so many cuisine mentioned in the menu cards which I've never tried it before, �� though it was quite expensive but they met my recommendations on time."
"To call Hot Doug's a Hot Dog Stand is an insult. It's an encased meat emporium filled with some of the most unqie tasting meats on the planet enclosed in thick sausages. If you come here for just a Hot Dog you're going to dissapointed with the 30 minute wait.Spend money here, it will be worth it. $12 for something that looks like a sausage might seem like a lot but you're getting some of the most unique taste in all of America. Not 100% what mine had in it but I know there was Crayfish. I also tasted my buddies Foie Gras and another buddies Boar and both were great. Hot Doug's lives up to the hype and it's honestly one of the best places I've ever eaten in my life. Duck Fat Fries are great as well.Hot Doug's is a treat and with it's long lines and limited hours you need to plan your trip i"
"Was in Chicago for a convention and everyone said, ""you have to try Gino's Pizza, it's the best"". Seven of us went for dinner and were not impressed. ��The artichoke spinach dip was the best item on the menu. ��The pizza was not at all what we expected and ended up feeding the leftovers to the homeless. ��I am a pizza addict but this pizza was the worst I have ever eaten. ��From now on, it's New York style for me! ��The service was poor and the waitress seemed irritated when we had to ask for refills of our drinks. ��Couldn't even get a pen to write on the wall. ��Oh, well, won't be back."
"I've been coming here since they first opened in 1991, got hooked on the first bite!Great fresh, local food, I can't stay away!"
Ok!1 so I went back with my friend for his birthday and there was a crowd of us again. This time it was a million times better. I didn't feel uncomfortable being there. It was a Tuesday night and the Lady playing the piano and singing with her very fun band was amazing. I think they play there every Tuesday night. I will go back to see them again. This time was 10 times better and the bar man was such fun and a delight to talk too. I can't remember his name but he had a beard and glasses I think. He opened the hatch to the down stairs so we could lean over the bar and look down into some history. So cool!!
"Wow. Truly the dinning experience of a lifetime. I have a lot to say about the meal I had at Grant Achetz's Alinea. I haven't stopped talking about it for the last three days. However, so much of the fun comes from the surprise that awaits you with every course I wouldn't want to spoil anything with too many details. I'll just say; the food is art, it's theater, it's emotional, it made me laugh out loud several times, it was epic, and worth every penny. Cheers to Chef Achetz!"
Definitely a fan of that little place! I've been there quite a few times before and never was disapointed with the food I had. The service is usually great too. If you have never been there in the summer I suggest you give it a try and have one of there smoothies.
"i use to love this place but one cold day i was craving their crab cakes, so i went there 10 min before opening and the hostess was soooo rude. she was like umm we arent open yet. (ok i get it its can be annoying when your rushing to open and someone is breathing down your neck) i apologized. my friend and i walked around went to reckless and came back 15 minutes later. she walked up and huffed "" its you again?! we still arent open"" i appoligized again thinking i was wrong on time. and was waiting outside. and in ear shot she talked about how she hated her job and hated putting up with customers... i put my craving aside and went else where."
"The food looked real pretty but....I'll start with the dessert. ?I ordered a piece of carrot cake that looked like it was going to be something that stopped my heart with bliss. ?Well, no real eggs in it and no milk and no processed sugar - oh my god, it tasted like crap! ?I almost cried.Radichio salad is good, though the dressings have always been rather bland to me-pretty disapointing. I don't ?know how they managed to mess up oil and vinegar but they did.I had a very pretty but disapointing lasagna in there once, and a noodle with mock beef dish - again, oh so pretty but so disapointing in taste! ?So bland!Here's what I think: ?If you are a diaabetic or you have food allergies, okay, I can see you eating this stuff. ?But if you don't have a problem like that, don't do this to yourself! "
"I've been here at least a dozen times and every time it keeps getting better, sure a Chicago style hot dog is the same everywhere you go, but the different varieties that are offered, the Duck dog, the wild boar, the crawfish, and all other rotational dogs are great. Only problem I have is that it's cash only and there is always no matter what time you go a line that you have to wait for at least 30 min. Really sucks if it rains. Other than that the food is great, the owner is always in a good mood and it's very clean. I always recommend this place to my friends"
"Love, love this place. Wines are excellent, good labels and extraordinarily inexpensive for the neighborhood. Well thought out flights if you like those- and not just of the wine.The cheeses are excellent too- if you aspire to gourmand status, you could do worse than to train at this place. The Chef, John Caputo is excellent, hospitable and always in the Tribune for one or another of his restaurants, knows his stuff. Great place to just meet people, everyone friendly, especially around the circular bar...oh by the way: swear their burger is better than Kuma's!"
"First, the food here is pretty good. ��The service, however, is absolutely terrible! ��They have no idea how to treat their customers. ��Given the number of excellent Chicago area Korean restaurants, this place really should work on fixing this problem. ��We have been loyal customers of this restaurant for many years, but we will not go here ever again. ��If you are unhappy with anything, they will basically disregard you and ignore you for the rest of the evening. ��Not good. ��There are many great choices in Chicago for excellent food and this restaurant and all others that do not appreciate their customers should ��not be rewarded for their bad behavior."
"We were a group of 9 celebrating a birthday a little after 8pm. ��We got seated all the way in the back in front of the kitchen near the bathrooms. ��We approached the hostess and requested a better table and she explained that we would have to wait 20 minutes which I think should have been told to us from the beginning as oppose to after we were seated again in area that seem isolated. ��Our waitress looked confused and didn't really attend to us. ��I think because it was a given she was going to recieve a minimum 18% tip because we were a group of over 6, she didn't have to attend to us. ��The food was outstanding though and that's why it gets three stars. ��Also, I am not racist but a member in our group noticed that everyone seated in the main dining area were white and we were the only hisp"
"I LOVE this place! My boyfriend and I live nearby and we order out the chicken noodle soup (pho) at least once a week. It's not too salty or too greasy and it really fills you up. It ends up being a lot of bang for the buck for $6.50 plus free fruit for dessert too. Also, the people who work at the restaurant are the nicest I've ever encountered. They remember us and they often throw in a free smoothie or appetizer to show their appreciation for our continued loyalty. Even better if you want to eat at the restaurant it's BYOB."
"The best Greek food in the city. ��I love it. ��The seafood is great, and I always have a fun time. ��I always make the trip to the city for their cuisine, IT IS THE BEST!"
"We have been to LaVilla many times for dinner, showers, rehearsal dinners and weddings, but they outdid themselves on our last visit. ��We were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary and had a wonderful meal, the best service and pleasant atmosphere. ��They even suprised us with a yummy platter decorated with ""Happy 40th Anniversary"", hearts and singing after our meal. ��We loved it! ��By the way, their New Year's Eve parties are terrific."
Everything here is just delicious. Love this place.
"This is my favorite place to have a great drink in the entire city. ��I am not talking about a beer with friends but a great drink. ��That is what these guys do, they take their drinks seriously. ��Want an unbelievable cocktail with house made bitters, fresh ingredients and a staff that is incredibly knowledgeable and friendly? ��Come here. ��This place isn't for everyone and that is the point. ��That is why they don't have a sign outside. ��You come here to enjoy yourself, have amazing drinks, listen to great music and not have to worry about someone taking Facebook photos of themselves on their camera phone. ��I like dive bars, Milwaukee St. bars and I even like going to the bars/clubs on Rush/Diversey and River North. ��When I want a serious drink in a relaxed place though I come here. ��If you w"
"I've been here, probably 7 times, and it's a great place to bring out-of-towners. Their pizza is pretty great, and the home brewed draft beer selection is quite amazing. I try to go there on an off night as the weekends are just silly. The customer service is ok and the prices are reasonable. Enjoy a night a Piece!"
"If you loved purple pig then youll looove this. same idea new twist. very good food, and i truly recommend going their for dinner. I lived the pizzas and the risoto. yumm!!See lucas at the bar for some cofee patron cocktails sooo good!"
"Lunch menu is small but good for it's price. Dinner salad bar and meat is alot better. the only thing I hate about this place is that they seat customer by race. I was seated way in the back conner in the ""asian section"" so the good meat rarely make it to us. May be it was just my imagination but it is way too obious. Request a seat if they try to take you too far from the kitchen."
"The best pizza in the city for thin crust especially. Also...the absolute BEST artichoke dip.Cheap pizza, great food, good service if you dont feel like getting dolled up and going somewhere expensive that night."
A very nice places with superb baked on premises goods. I come here at least ones a month. At this point I tasted qutie a few things and loved everything. NIce ambience make it a nice date spot too.
"Let me just start by saying that this is my first Yelp Review!! ��I am way excited because I always use this website and I finally decided to become a yelper. ��On to the review................So I went to Spacca Napoli last night for dinner with my boyfriend. ��The place was cute. ��Casual inside, nice and clean, and very nice outdoor seating. ��The outside was full (of course) and we opted to wait for a seat rather then eating inside. ��We ended up waiting about 10-15 mins which wasn't so bad since there was 2 other groups in front of us. ��After we were seated the experience went downhill.............First of all, we sat there for a good 10 minutes before we were even approached by a server. ��When she finally came over she was very friendly, and she took our drink order. ��We also put in an app"
A perfect restaurant! ��The food is glorious and the staff is so welcoming you feel like you are at a friend's house. ��Wines and beers are well chosen and they use a lot of organic and local foods.
"I absolutely love this place. I'm a huge fan of the coconut mango beef (served in a real live coconut!), but I'd have to say, I've never had a bad dish here (lemongrass beef app and curry chicken entree also rock). What's more, the place is cozy and adorable AND byob (no corkage)! My friends and I often come here on a night out with several bottles of our good friend Charles Shaw in tow, and use it as our pregame before heading out to the bars on Lincoln (I know what you're thinking...how recession-chic). I'd recommend a reservation on the weekends, since it's smaller and tends to get a bit crowded. But the service is great, and they are super accommodating when it comes to getting you seated. Last time I was there, they even took a table from the front room and created a place for us to s"
"I was starving one day and as I was driving by I saw this place. ��There were cars everywhere, people hanging out the doors. ��And I decided to stop, no matter how many people were waiting for food, the service was quick. ��The hot dog was probably the tastiest hot dog I have ever eaten, The fries were okay but the hot dog was worth a stop there any day."
"I used to love coming to Frontera but the food has gone down hill in the last year. A group of four went on a Friday night. We waited about 45m and were seated. The drinks were great and the apps were good not great. Something was missing, not sure what. The main courses were terrible. I ordered the flank steak, med rare, it came out fully cooked. I tried it and it was like what shoe leather must taste like. I sent it back. The braised brisket was hard like it wasn't braised long enough. He sent it back. When the dishes came back, all they did was heat it up. They didn't cook a new steak and the brisket was just microwaived. I sent mine back for good. My friend was so hungry he just ate the brisket. Also, the chicken enchiladas my gf had the tortillas weren't cooked properly because they w"
"I think that if you r looking for the place to have dinner and want to be sure to leave the restaurant satisfied with the taste of food , this place is the nomber one to consider. last night I had the best wild salmon and it was really fabulous. and my huspbent ordered his favorite steak , he loves steaks there, but this time his ""midium rear"" was a little bit overcooked..and first time we were not happy with the service of this place : the waiter-David was very arrogant !!! that's why I give this place only 4 stars.. ��to the waiter i'd give just 2"
"amazing atmosphere, very fun, romantic, if you are going for a cute date, ask for a booth, it's def a perfect date place. be aware it's expensive, so be careful who you are taking out, not a good place for a casual date, unless you are ok dropping 150 bucks. If u are going with a long term gf or your wife, I recommend only ordering one main course, with salad, cheese fondu and chocolate fondu at the end, it's way too much food to order 2! Good food, great sea food, awesome beef, delicious dessert. It's got a better, more romantic environment than melting pot, but melting pot has a better selection and more choice and cheaper prices."
"Boyfriend wanted to try this out so I complied. ��We went there last night and it's all I can talk about today, telling so many people. ��We shared the smashed red potatoes, the cauliflower, ahi salad and by far the best thing was the cornbread. ��I know, cornbread? ��But seriously, it's the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. ��My bartender (we sat at the bar to eat), was so informative (Zach) ��He knew his stuff inside and out.....go there, try for yourself!!!"
"I think this is the best churrascario in Chicago. I tried Brazzaz and Sal Carvao (which is closed at this point) and liked the meat at Fogo de Chao better. two negatives: 1) even if you have a reservation, you end up waiting upto half an hour 2) I don't eat pork and although I say that when I sit down they keep bringing pork."
"Well, I would love to give this place a 4 or 5 star because their food is pretty good. ?However, there service is a complete joke. ?My fiance and I order delivery from Sultan's frequently. ?They take forever and when they finally get to you, your order isn't right. ?Mine has been correct once or twice out of a dozen times. ?All I order is the Lamb Shwarma with hot sauce and tahini. ?They always, always, always forget the Tahini.So, tonight I decided to call. ?The service I received made me so mad! ?The phone guy begins by saying I take customer service very seriously. ?After I explained that I was sick of my order getting wrong, he says Well, you have to understand. ?We get busy and we offer cheap food. ?What the hell does that mean? ?I'm a server. ?I work in the industry and I think that "
Simply the best pizza I have had. I don't know their secret but it's all in the crust. They are worth going out of your way for.
"If you're looking for real Chinese food - not American ""Chinese"" takeout food - this is where to find it. ��I'm not Chinese but I've spent a lot of time in China, so I know what I'm talking about. ��The majority of customers were Chinese when I went - that's how you know it's good. ��There were a number of non-Chinese people there too though - it's sure to please no matter what your background is.It is quite big and can be somewhat crowded. ��Tables and chairs are nothing fancy; it's very typical of the average place you'd walk into off the street in China. ��If you insist on a quiet or more upscale ambiance - or if you're going on a first date and don't know your date's preferences - I'd look elsewhere. ��But if it's high food quality and affordable price you're looking for, this place can't be"
"I am not a huge fan of the entrees here, but for appetizers and cocktails, there is no place I'd rather go.Raspberry mojitos and Horchata drinks with some ceviche and guacamole = heaven.Plus, there is always a good crowd to watch and the decor is colorful and fun."
Very interesteing place. Has a unique atmosphere. Like the champagne drinks/coctails. The mini hotdogs are terrible but all in all I like the place. I'd go there again with a few friends. This is not a place for big groups or shooters...definitely.
"I went here with my family.. and the service was TERRIBLE! they ignored us and when they did deliver the food, it was missing a lot of stuff that we ordered. Sigh.. this place used to be the BEST few years back.. what happened?"
I visited sushi X for the first time last week and I am definitely going back! ��They have some of the best rolls in town and I heard the Sushi Chef is one of the best in all of Illinois. ��I ordered the Godzilla and a philadelphia roll and a bowl of miso soup. ��The service was prompt and the sushi was mouthwatering and very tasty!
"After reciently moving to the Divsion/Damen hood I fially got to try this place. I herd great things, and they were right. I stopped by with a buddy just to grab a drink and catch up. The place was busy but we got lucky and got a few bar seats right away. The bartender was a super cute girl who was really nice and attentive, even though she was alone, and we weren't regulars. After a few sodas we felt the need to look at the menu. Since niether of us were starving we wanted something to split. Didnt have to. Our bartender pointed out the sliders and also recomended the mac and cheese, as a side. Most places want you to spend money on too much food. We each had a slider, one was an angus burger(buddy said it was good, and not over cooked), I had the crab cake slider. Totaly different than a"
"Love this place, not for carnivores but the food is the best"
"The food was really good, and the price not that bad for the location. ��The wait staff was amazing and friendly, something that was totally unexpected!"
"I took my girlfriend here last night for her birthday. She is all about food presentation and I heard great things of Alinea from close friends.I was surprised at the decor being more casual than expected. But anyways, the food was incredible. All the dishes were perfectly mastered on the plate and it made for a great experience. My girlfriend is the artsy one but I really appreciated the talent of the chefs.My business partner has also mentioned a list of celebrities he's seen here, so this should be a place to add to celebrity hot spots in Chicago!"
This place is amazing. Great food and drinks. :)
"I'm ashamed to admit that I used to think Reza's was the best Persian in the city. My husband heard this place was good and we just moved to the area, so we went a couple nights ago. Wow! Their menu is almost the same as Reza's. But Noon tastes better, and is a little cheaper. And, you know that if you go to a Persian restaurant around sunset during Ramadan, and the place is packed with Muslims, it must be good.When you first sit and they bring the water, they also bring warm fresh pita bread with a plate of onion and feta. We ordered the hummus, which was some of the best hummus we've had. My husband is not really big on hummus but he ate a lot of it. I had the chicken and lamb kebab combo with dill rice, and my husband had the lamb kebab and shrimp combo with dill rice. The rice and the "
"The cheeseburger I had here was delicious and the salad bar was very extensive and it featured chopped chicken liver which I tries for the first time here and it was delicious. Overall I would definitely come here again, the atmosphere was very welcoming, just be sure to order the salad bar."
"Ummm - should have been called Bad Burger. ��This place is a hole and the food was whipped up with no care for quality or presentation. ��The beer list was decent, but not worth coming back for. ��Pass."
"Well, I went to Fogo de Chao for lunch today. I believe Fogo de Chao loosely translates from Portuguese to campfire in English.The food is excellent. Keep your disk to green and the meat is non-stop. The hostess was excellent and the manager introduced himself to ensure everything was alright.I thoroughly enjoyed the lamb chops. Each slice of beef I requested was medium and cooked perfectly.I would highly suggest going during the lunch hours.Cost per person with tip included was two shy of $50."
"I gotta say, I'm shocked that there are people giving this place 3 stars or lower. I grew up in Chicagoland and have tried all of the ""Famous"" pizza places. It took moving away and coming back to discover the Art of Pizza. Every time I'm in I can't help but admire the diversity coming through the door, everybody loves it! Yes, it's not the place to bring a date or enjoy a lengthy meal at the table, but it's not supposed to be! Best pizza hands down, great daily specials, and no tourist bs clogging up the joint."
Absolutely awesome pizza at a great price. Will definitely be going back.
They do not have the best deep dish here as claimed. I've had it plenty of times before and even the kind from Connie's is better! All the other food is fine and I always am treated nice by the waitstaff.
I've been to all the restaurants in greek town. I like this one a little more than the rest. The food is always fresh and delicious. They really know how to cook octopus! The ambiance and atmosphere are remarkable and inviting. Its like taking a trip to greece in your car...with free valet parking!!
"i watched people move around to the sounds of people sitting. ��i tried a couple beers and they seemed adequate enough to do their job (like most of us, right? right). ��i engaged a dessert that was well made, built up, but fell slightly in it's actual performance. ��i may come back soon if the crowd dies down. ��also, much like the airport, this place features a family bathroom in which private parties can share intimate time in. ��a drinkingman's staple."
"I took a friend of mine to the Violet Hour on my sister's recommendation, and I'm so glad we went! ��The Violet Hour serves fantastic drinks and great small plate food. ��The atmosphere is completely original yet completely welcoming. ��You need to take a friend, wear a snazzy outfit, and go enjoy The Violet Hour!"
"Food this good and this cheap should NOT be missed!! ��A neighbor suggested my husband and I try Nuevo Leon for its authentic mexican food and great hospitality-- and we were very pleased at her suggestion! ��We eat here at least once a month- and it's always less than $25 for both of us together. ��The BYOB also helps for the budget minded who want to have a couple of Modelos with their Carne, and not pay double the price for them!!I almost always order the Carne Asada- which is such a large portion that I eat half and save the rest for a steak sandwich the next day! :) ��My husband tries out a new pork or beef dish everytime, and has yet to find something he hasn't devoured.We also took my brother and Colombian sister-in-law (who is a fabulous cook!) there for dinner twice, and Nuevo Leon go"
"Simply It is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. ��Located in the heart of Lincoln Park, it has wonderfully delicious, authentic Vietnamese food. ��My favorite dishes are the summer rolls and the beef pho, but everything is made with the freshest ingredients and tastes amazing. ��The servers are all very nice and helpful if you have any questions about the menu or need any recommendations. ��The restaurant is BYOB and the prices are very reasonable. ��I have gone to the restaurant by myself, on a date, and with large groups of people - and the restaurant is accommodating to tables of any size. ��Everyone that I take always leaves happy, full, and excited to go back for seconds!"
"Yum! ��Never had a bad experience. ��Always get your money's worth. ��Usually get the falafel sandwich, but just tried the chicken shwarma (spelling?) yesterday - delicious! ��Filled with hummus, fresh cucumber salad, and lots of chili sauce"
"I live close to Longman and have eaten here many times - more often than at any other restaurant in Chicago. The first few times were in the spring of 2011. I thought this place was really great - I liked the interior, the mix of people, secondary cut centric menu... it made me so happy that this was in my neighbourhood. Flash forward to 2012 and I have to say, I wish the michelin team would do a surprise visit. It should not have a star at this point. A year or two ago, perhaps. The downhill trajectory began for me in October 2011. That meal was - ok. I tried all the interesting cuts like lamb heart, etc. things I am normally excited to try, but it was kind of bland and the temperature lukewarm. Salty and fatty, as some here have commented, but without much flavour. The food didn't taste "
"I love this place!I had my first oyster at the Shaw's Bar (never actually ate at the restaurant) and I have been a regular ever since. I probably go once a month (it gets pretty expensive once you order a bottle of wine and few dozen oysters), but it is well worth it.. I always order the smaller oysters, I discovered they usually are tastier. Be aware that sometimes it gets very crowded, there is a waiting line, and also I don't think they take reservations (at the bar). Some nights they have live music, which gets loud and barely able to communicate. So if you're not into that kind of stuff, make sure to call and go when there is no music. I can't wait to go back next month!"
"I've been coming in every single day for the past week for lunch, that's just how much I love this place!Their lunch combo meal of the sandwich and what you get with it is unbeatable. The first two days I just had the beef sandwich, and in the days following that I'd thought that I should change it up a bit. Tofu, chicken, fish they've got all kinds of sandwiches here for lunch.Also by having such a filling lunch here, I've noticed that I tend to eat less for the rest of the day. It makes me feel healthy :) I'm coming back for more sandwiches and probably won't ever get sick of it for lunch. 5 stars for awesome food, value and service!r"
We hosted our son's rehearsal dinner in the upstairs private room at Mia Francesca's. ��WOW it was amazing. ��From the 1st phone call to the event coordinator to the actual event I was treated so pleasantly and so accomodating. ��The food was incredible and very generous portions. ��On a 5 star rating I would give a 6.....The atmosphere was quaint and the staff so pleasant. ��Would recommend highly.Jan S
"I have food allergies, and this place is wonderful! Never before have I had so many menu options. This place is not only great for Vegans, but for anyone avoiding dairy and/or lactose. I trust that they know their ingredients, and I love coming back here! �� The soy milkshakes are phenomenal, and the Titanic BLT burger is my personal favorite."
"The cuisine at Calo is pretty freakin' solid. I had some gnocci dish that was excellent. It loses a star because of their decor; it is some cross between a lovely Italian restaurant and a sports bar. Their kitchen is open fairly late, making it one of a few options available to me after getting off work at my serving job. The waiter was pretty decent, seeming to try to rush us a bit because he wanted to get the hell out of there. Who can blame him for that though?"
"I'v been here a couple times now, and cant tell you how much i love these tortas. Forget any torta that you have ever had, these are the best! I have tried just about all of them. You cant go wrong.I dont care about the size of the place, long lines, or the price of the menu but they do need to improve upon the food delivery system and overall communication. The last time I was there they lost our order ( ok whatever, it happens) once we flaged down one of the bussers the food came out in 10. same thing happened with out churros and the hot chocolate. After we ate, the Hostest came to us and appologized and offered us free ice cream. Nice gesture, but that also didnt come and we had to leave. Also, just about every employee is glued to their cell phone which can be slightly frustrating whe"
I really enjoyed the food and would definitely go back.
i went to this place couple times service is really really bad i never seen this kind of bad services i wish there do better over all worst restaurant
"Disappointing experience: ��WARNING....do not let them seat you in the ""back room"". The area of the restaurant in the far back, behind a half wall, is small and much louder than the already very loud restaurant. Our party of three was seated there between two large group parties---even though there were available tables in the large room. (And, yes, we were dressed very nicely and arrived on time for our reservation.) The two large parties in the back with us were talking over each other, shrieking, and laughing at high decibels all evening. We were stuck between them and found we could not even have a conversation at all with the terrible acoustics of that small area. As we exited the back room, the sound in the main restaurant seemed almost quiet in comparison. We politely told the manage"
"Went there yesterday with my beau. ��I ordered the shrimp po' boy and the beau ordered prime rib sandwich. ��We both split the tomato/red pepper bisque...AMAZING!!! ��I couldn't finish my food and the beau was too hungover to eat his....I enjoyed mine and he enjoyed his later. ��We've also been there for breakfast. ��It can get pretty busy, but the wait is never really long. ��The servers were fast moving and friendly. ��Our server yesterday kept forgetting the hot chocolate we ordered...it was actually kind of funny, since we saw another server throw the first one away, then our server made another, but she forgot again...not holding that against her though. ��I am a server too, and sometimes you just forget.great place for breakfast!!"
"Quite recently, my friends and I were having a huge party! We rented out a huge space, invited all my friends, had a DJ, and everything setup. Until I realized we had no one to cater food. Calling up the owner Tuan two days before he agreed right away! I've been into Simply It 5 times before and every single time has been a blast. So I thought why not? Vietnamese after all, is one of my most favorite cuisines.Tuan immediately took my order asked what I'd like and even gave me a free bubble tea just for ordering with him. We ordered quite a few things, lemongrass chicken, beef short ribs, chicken fried rice, dumplings, avocado wontons, beef and asparagus, sate shrimp and they all came with enough white rice!!! The price was probably the best part, it was all such great value. All this food "
"Maxim named this best pizza in Chicago. ��I'm going to have to agree that i was very impressed. ��You can smell its awesome aroma from outside. ��I've only had the non-stuffed, thin crust pizza. ��It isn't your typical thin crust, it's more like a handtossed or pan crust. ��I recommend double the cheese and sausage!!! Outstanding!!! ��Great service, even when you are arguing about what toppings to get on the pizza :-) ��It's moderately priced."
"This place is really good. I tried the fried chicken which was crisp on the outside and juicy throughout. I had one of the many rice bowls they offer and it was delicious and fresh. If you don't know what to order, the owners are really nice and helpful, so you can't go wrong. Trust me, this place is great!"
"This is the second brazilian steakhouse I've been to. ��That said, this is also the second best brazilian steakhouse I've been to. ��The service is great, and as far as comparing it to Fogo, it's right on par, good service, attentive, polite, very helpful. ��But, the meat, just wasn't as good. ��Actually, not even close, it was extremely salty, which usually means, a lower quality of meat, with a feeble attempt to mask it with salt. ��I couldn't eat as much as at Fogo, because all the salt, literally dried me out. ��If you liked Fogo, but need more salt, you'll love Brazzaz!"
Excellent!
"My wife and I always come here for special occasions as well as just for a night out on the town. This place has great food, but especially known for their steaks. I like the blue cheese crusted filet and my wife always gets the walnut crusted halibut. We usually split a salad or appetizer. My wife likes the desserts, which I sometimes will dabble a little in. The drinks are always good here as well. I've also planned a bachelor party dinner here as well, which turned out great. The service was awesome and couldn't have had a better time."
Wonderful experience. Great food. The beef sopas ��were to die for. Just wish it wasn't so dang crowded.
"The place to go if you enjoy rude service, cold food that wasn't what you asked for, and hipsters glaring at you."
Great BYOB Italian food! Warm environment that is nice for a date or small group of friends. The service is a little speedy and they do not go out of their way to be overly attentive or friendly. Be prepared for a big plate of yummy pasta with lots of sauce that is just as good the next day for lunch at home.
"Just the best Vietnamese food in Lincoln Park, and pretty much the city. We've been to many Vietnamese places, and it's genuinely one of the best. Cozy small setting with excellent, friendly service to top off the fabulous food. We had a large house party recently so we thought of Simply It. They put together an array of appetizers and large dishes that wowed the crowd. Everyone commented on the food and asked where to find the restaurant. Eat at the restaurant, cater a party, whatever. You'll like it."
"I would not recommend. Too many other great restaurants in town.I was there for their opening and was not too impressed, but I figured I would give them time to work out the new restaurant challenges. Well went back this weekend and..well...what a waste of money. ��Don't get me wrong the restaurant looks very cool, but I went there for good food and service.Also, I read the most recent review that gave them 5 stars and it was obviously written by the management to try to elevate their dismal 3 stars. When I went to the opening they used words like ""sexy"", 'harvest table"" and that is a dead give away that the review was written by them.Sad when a restaurant is so bad that they have time to write reviews about themselves, but not fix the food and service.Good luck Zed...and what kind of name "
best pizza in the city hands down. maybe the best in the world. their homemade brews are delish. Their white pizza is out of this world. great place to catch a game. great place for huge groups. only problem is no reservations and you have to wait a while for a table but well worth it every time.
Not coming back after suffering food poisoning from the baked snow crab hand roll. Two out of four in our party ate it and we both got food poisoning.
"Love the atmosohere of this place. ��It is very bright, open, and can put anyone in a good mood. ��The food is awesome and they have a solid drink menu that is full of different mojito creations. ��My favorite menu items are the skirt steak and the ahi tuna... but everything is good. ��There is also a beef and plaintain appetizer that you can not miss. ��This is a fun place for groups. ��It is my go to spot if I am planning a work dinner or a celebration with friends."
Good food. Fun for groups of people.
"Thank you Zed 451 for a great time on Friday night. ��We had a party of 15 and everyone had a wonderful time. ��Thank you so much to Sammy for setting up the Zed bus to pick us up, it was nice that we could all ride together! ��The dining experience was really great. ��The food and presentation was fantastic and price points for all budgets. ��We really appreciate all the attentive service by the entire staff, but a special thanks to Jennifer and Katie for taking good care of us. ��We will happily come back. ��Thanks again Zed!"
short and simple.goooood sushi.
"The food is half-way decent, I've honestly had better. I've been to this location on many occasions and its always the same.Rude, rude R U D E!!! Worst service/discrimination I've gotten A N Y W H E R E in my life. If you come with a man, or korean friend, you'll be fine. It you're used to the service and have been a long time customer, cool. But for people who want to enjoy their food a nice welcoming atmosphere DO NOT go here."
"Best moussaka EVER! Trust me, i've tried it in pretty much every restaraunt in Greektown."
"omg this place is to die for. i like, dream about it. european-style eating, communcal tables makes it fun and adventurous. ate marinated fried chorizo stuffed olives, an amazing panini, goat-cheese and eggplant tapenade (more please!) and somethng with a fried quail egg- crazy eating made with love. great location too. expect a wait!!"
lucky to get a booth!
Service is excellent. Love the fish and chips at lunch. Just tried the olive and pickle appetizer-little salty!
"An experience unmatched. ��We dined at Trio when Grant was the executive chef there and were blown away. ��Alinea is somehow even better. ��We found the staff to be extremely gratious and educational which is necessary if you want to get the most out of this experience. ��And the food is fantastic. ��The presentation is entertaining, to say the least. ��The creativity of the chef and his team is unparalleled. ��And everything tastes amazing! ��Even the dishes I was convinced I wouldn't like melted in my mouth. ��For those without huge expense accounts, it's worth saving up for!"
"OMG, this place has the best Italian food in Chicago. I went here on a whim with my parents one night and have gone back 3 time since. They have the best meat-free lasagna that I have ever had. Also, they are amazing at birthday reminders. I got a 15% off coupon right before my birthday and then a 1/2 birthday coupon after!!! So great!!!!"
"Absolute deliciousness! I'm half Korean and grew up with Korean food. ��However, my mom sure didn't make fried chicken this good. ��I was so excited when Crisp opened a few years back. ��It has definitely become my go-to place when I'm craving some spicy bi bim bop and am too lazy to make it myself. ��When my brother visits from Michigan, stopping for lunch is de rigeur. ��We ��split a half chicken with Seoul Sassy sauce and a baby buddha bowl. ��Allison's Atomic sauce and the mushrooms are quite good too."
"So, I'm pregnant and found myself at Coast after work with a friend craving an avacado roll. ��I knew Coast had a reputation for great sushi at a hefty price so I was a little worried about how someone obviously going vegetarian would be preceived. ��Well, our waitress (Debbie, I think) was amazing. ��She was so sweet and very patient. ��She made suggestions and even told me about a fab vegetarian roll that was seriously so delicious. ��The friend I was with had tons of questions about sushi and she went through each without any hesitation and didn't make us feel silly at all. ��After all that, she even came back after the check was given to let us know she charged us a dollar too much! ��I was so impressed by the service - I think I would go back just to have Debbie as our waitress again. ��The o"
"The bongo room is the jam. ��Food was about 30 bucks for the 2 of us but honestly, well worth it. The coffee was good, the staff was promt and on their game. Hands down... blows yolk out of the water. p.s. coffee was damngood as well"
Worst service I have had in a LONG time! Better service at Taco Bell! Davanti Enoteca is a place that makes great traditional food TOO COMPLICATED and messes it up. Our snooty waitress was too busy cleaning wine glasses to bother with our service. She took our lemonade and didn't return with a refill until we had our check. What a mess this place is! The food was bad....BAD! Do they pay people to give this place 5 stars? Will NEVER return! Horrible food and worse service. My review in one word.....YUCK!
"I have to say that this is was the best ��and freshest fish I have had in a very long time. ��A friend and I had gone there on Tuesday March 17th it was busy ��for a weeknight,so right there I knew it was going to be good. ��The waitress was great she made suggestions which is great. ��She was also on top of filling our glass with wine. ��I had yellow tail tuna that was amazing. ��I will be going back there sooner then later."
Love it! Everything there is great except the hour long wait to eat.
I have eaten here on multiple occasions and have never once found anything wrong with any of the dishes. ��They are always amazing and full of flavor. ��I have taken many visitors here as well and it's always a crowd pleaser. ��The current Mahi Mahi special is to die for!! ��Great atmosphere and service as well.
The Chi-Town bowl is the greatest ever! And always add an egg to it for some extra flavor. We live nearby and usually end up eating here once or twice a week. I actually get sad on Monday's when they are closed and I have a craving for chicken!
Had the porkchops and thought they were fantastic!I also had the coconut shrimp...best I ever had.My only complaint would be that I came a 2nd time and had the pot roast and it wasn't all that great. ��Overall I love this place and I will be coming out often!
"Our waitress was very friendly and did a great job at telling us about the various specials and at recommending items on the menu.Food delicious ��(but not cheap by any means, especially if you get drinks), great service, and very nice atmosphere (great place for a nice romantic date!). The portions are on the smaller side, which I suppose is often the case at a restaurant of this standing. 4-1/2 stars."
"I been coming here for many years, since i was 5 years old. ��As the year goes on, the service at the front counter have gotten worst year after year after year. ��It seems as if they are a little over confident with the client tell they got here and finally they don't care about service at all. ��The food have been ok, and the peking duck isn't as great as people describe it nor is it even worth the price. ��Highly don't recommend this place, not even worth the wait. ��I feel like the only reason people come here is because there isn't much other Chinese BBQ around. ��Don't come here Hon Kee don't the street is a much better place, more of a Chinese feel restuarant."
"Bin 36 hosts a series of Wine (and Wine & Pairings) classes. Last week I attended their ""Wine Speak"" class, which was led by Jan Henrichsen. Jan is an engaging and extremely knowledgeable asset to the Bin family. She packed this 30-minute course with innumerable wine facts. I can now expand my wine assessment beyond ""Yum"" or ""Yuck""! I can tell you if my wine has legs, is fruit-forward or mineral driven, if it's an honest wine or if it betrays it's nose! Can't say enough, LOVED the class & will be taking more of them."
"I really dislike this place. ��The only redeeming quality is the pickles, and they aren't any thing special they are just made of zucchini instead of cucumber. To me this seems like food snobbery at its best/worst- ��there is no advantage to making brisket out of kobe beef other than to be elitist. Brisket is cooked slow and low because its making the most out of the cheap left over cuts of meat- making it out of kobe only adds expense. �� The corn bread is tasteless and dreadful- it feels like chewing on saw dust. ��OH I almost forgot about the Pretzel Roll!! Good lord I hate their pretzlel roll! Firstly, it totally overpowers the pulled pork or the brisket sandwich-all you can taste is bread. ��Secondly, I am not sure how they manage to consistently serve these things stale. ��The crust of the"
"Art of Pizza lives up to the name, I moved to Chicago from South Carolina and this was the first Chicago style pizza that I tried, and it's the only place i'll order from now. They have a great selection pizza by the slice and their daily specials are unbelievable. The daily specials are simply just too much food... Wednesdays and the Chicken Parm are a must!!Easy to get to by car, nice eat in experience, and the customer service is top notch!"
"In the beginning we ordered several tapas, but bacon wrapped dates were especially great. As main dish we chose a paella, but it looked like a deconstructed one...chicken was on top not incorporated. It tasted good, but was not what I expected. Sangria was not good...the first one that they brought us had so much ice, it tasted like water. The ambience was very nice....overall, I would say was a nice experience."
I live close to the Bad Apple and after one so-so experience decided to give it another try yesterday. ��Unfortunately the Bad Apple food is still Bad. ��The beer list is respectable but the burger was once again pre-fab and nothing special. The turkey sandwich was lunchmeat on bread. ��To top it off they make their own ketchup -which tastes like marinara sauce at room temperature. . �� Yuck. ��With Jury's and the Daily Bar and Grill a short walk away...I'd suggest you take the walk.
"Warning warning-Absolutely awful experience!!The ambiance is nice with cute chairs and a beautiful bar. ?Unfortunately the nice words stop there. ?This restaurant has amateur written all over it; from the napkin fold to the management to the absolutely terrible food.The food: did I just enter a catering facility or a restaurant? ?Oh wait, my bad. ?Smoked salmon pin wheels a la 1995 wedding, pasta with your choice of sauce a la all you can eat buffet, and a bun less burger a la Atkins 5 years ago. ?They are extremely unorganized and apparently not trained. ?The server didn't know the answers to any of our food questions and said, sorry but they just finished the menu yesterday and I haven't tried any of the food. ?When we asked why there isn't any prices on the menu she said that they were "
"I've never had a bad meal here either, but it's the most over-rated restaurant I've ever eaten at. ��The prices are great and the food is good, but like I said, it certainly isn't great. �� On one occassion, I had the enchilada plate and it was very good, and about $6, which is hardly worth complaining about. ��Then, I gave them the burrito test. ��Not that great. ��But nonetheless, it is cheap."
"I eat out 365 lunches and 350 dinners a year. ��This was by far the worst food I have eaten. ��For those of you who are used to Prison Grub, this place may work for you. ��Great decor, terrible service, Disasterous food. ��Real expensive, real bad. ��Everyone (or at least 75% of respondants) who has written a positive review is employed by Zed. ��I warn anyone reading this, don't waste your money and time. ��Stay far away. ��Drinks on the roof could be nice, but still, very over priced."
"Best Italian in Chicago - Service is top notch, the food is amazing and the wait is well worth it! ��This has become one of my fav. restaurants in the city. ��They really did a great job."
Very good food! ��Good vegetarian options as well just in case. ��The only down side is service can be slow.
"I visit the 3rd Coast every time I travel to Chicago. ��I love the flavor and the service is great. ��My favorite dish so far is the Cajun Chicken Penne, and the carrot cake is awesome. I always leave happy, and the 3rd Coast is a must if you're in Chicago."
"Great pizza long time patron, best mozza sticks! ��That said, the guy who answere the phone this evening doesn't serve your business well."
"Extremely disappointed at the overcooked crab and lobster which you would expect to be the best dish out of the entire menu giving that it is the crab house. Broccoli sidedish did not taste fresh, mac n cheese sidedish was made of dried up PENNE pasta (need me say more?). Got medium-well filet mignon when I ordered medium filet mignon and the beef did not taste fresh. I've had seafood that taste ten times better than this with half of the price. I sure will never return to this restaurant."
This place started the entire lounge/hand-crafted cocktail experience and it STILL is the best! From the speakeasy feel of the place to the staff and the amazingly refined drinks---it does it all right! ��Worth the wait if you have to wait as the experience is one you will never forget. Every time I have gone here I have been pleasantly surprised by how much the place continues to charm me and never gets old.
"Had an amazing dinner here last night. Have always been a fan of Rick Bayless and glad I was finally able to eat at one of his restaurants. I had the suckling pig torta, guacamole and a churro topped off with a nice Goose Island Matilda. The pork in the torta was amazing. Tender, juicy and very flavorful. I can easily say that it was not only the best torta I've ever had, but it may have been some of the best tasting pork I have ever eaten. The habenero salsa that came with it was fiery and delicous.The guacamole had great flavor and was seasoned perfectly. A lot of times I find guac to be bland, but not here. Very flavorful and delicous. The service was great and the people working there were very knowledgeable about the food and friendly. We waited about 25 min for a table on a wed night"
"Having worked in Uptown for a while, I always suggest that visitors stop by Demera for lunch or dinner. The staff is always very attentive, the service is quick and the food is excellent. The spice combinations in Ethiopian food are unlike I've ever experienced before- but delicious! Best of all, the waitresses are really patient and totally willing to walk you through the ultra-unfamiliar menu. Great for lunch or dinner and plenty of room for large groups!"
One of my favorites in Chicago!
"Wonderful experience. Food was inventive and fresh, beautifully presented, and aALL of the staff, from bartender to busboy was exemplary. Very informative about what was on the menu and the sommelier was amazing."
When does food take your breathe away? When you eat at Alinea. I brought my husband here to celebrate his big promotion. We both had the tour and I'm pretty sure it's changed our lives forever.
"This is where you take a date for drinks as a last stop before bed. Outstanding bar man (Michael?) knows his chops and knows how to be with the people. ��I've taken my wife a couple of times and we recover our dating spirit. Go there after a film or dinner, or get dressed and go out at 11 or midnight early in the week (no lines and crazy waiting to get in). Take a cab so you can make out in the cab ride home."
I use to like this restaurant...but sum of the girls there arent very polite and nice.the food is GREAT and so are the hot drinks but the service is the WORST!!!!!!!!!!!
"Went last night with some friends, went to El Cid's for some guacamole while burning the 1 hour wait we had to deal with (no big deal, the place is new and awesome, so of course there's going to be a wait).The chef sent our table a little taste of something - I forget what it was, but it had sliced apples and was beautifully presented and delicious (being a pescetarian, I gave my portion to my husband). ��Our table of four split the olives, rabbit pate, and kobe meatballs to start - no one was complaining. I had the gnuddi and the scallop bisque soup which were both delicious. ��Honestly, the fantastic smells coming from everyone's food made me consider eating meat again. �� My husband had the half chicken, which he enjoyed, my friend ordered the same as me, and her fiance ordered the pork be"
This place rocks! Get the chef's tasting menu and you cant go wrong. I'm upset it took me so long to get over there. We waited downstairs at the bar for 30 minutes but it was well worth the wait.
"Always great, love the service too. We eat here quite often and are never disappointed. Sangria is tasty, generally classic Margarita on the rocks- refreshing."
"This place is simply terrific! My only regret is people are finding out about this gem hidden away on Broadway! Now its hard to get a table even with the expansion. The sushi is great, the seafood madness is to die for and the prices are just right."
"the Dogs are definatley good but the fries are not fresh they even taste old , price has somthing to desire i think 7.00 is high for a damn HOt Dog and fries......"
"I know some people reserve 5 stars for fancy restaurants, but I must say this place is awesome for a finger licking Friday night. ��Some might argue about the most delicious sauce...I am true to the Seoul Sassy, but my boyfriend is obsessed with the BBQ....either way - it will become an addiction. ��Try it for a concert in the park or Ravinia - they have a whole chicken meal for like $20. ��It's delicious - you will not be disappointed. ��At worst you will regret reading this review because it will lead to a new addiction. ��We knew it was bad when we had worked out for 2 hours one night and still ended up with a whole fried chicken..."
"**Horrible Service**pizza ok**wait time horrific**If I wasn't so determined to have some dinner...I should have walked out. Ordered a standard sausage pizza, was told it would be 35-40 mins....we waited an hour & 45 mins four our pizza!!! ��We were being VERY patient and watched,three other groups delayed, and their evening ruined too.Deplorable!!!No apologies from staff either. ��And to top off the night...we waited 15 mins for the valet to get our car...AR finally tracked him down outside the garage talking on his cell phone!!DEPLORABLE ALL AROUND!!!"
good food...innovative...nice staff
Nice staff & great treats!i'm also a fan of the tea selection!
"Great salads and great greek food. It's a perfect lunch spot. Don't let the ocassional long lines stop you from trying it out, the line will go quickly and the wait is worth it."
I have been here once and cant forget the French Macarons here. Thumbs up!
"This is my second visit to Sunda. I remember having a great experience here the first time also. I had the watermelon eel appetizer dish last time which I thought was kind of strange but it ended up surprising me in a good way. The sweetness and freshness of the watermelon mixed really well with glazed eel.Anyway, back to last week. I ordered an Asian-style bbq pork which tasted better than the ones I normally get from my Asian joint in the South Loop except that it's 3 times more expensive here! I also had the Chilean Sea Bass, which tasted really fresh and cooked to perfection. This place rocks!"
My boyfried took my here recently. He is 5 yrs older than me and had talked about this place for awhile. I really think the outdoor deck upstairs offers something nice in this area. I also like the selection of food and wine. I did like being able to go up and my own food at the salad bar but sometimes it got a litttle crowed up there. We went on a Saturday at 8 so I guess that's to be expected. One thing I would say is the waitstaff is one of the best I have been around. Super friendly yet knoweldgable. I did not feel funny asking about different wines when I was not familiar with them. I think all in all this was a very good experience and would come back. It is just a little pricey for my taste.
I love love this place!! The honey roll is to die for! The godzilla roll is a must try too! It's so huge and satisfying! ��And it's byob!!!!!
"Summary: beautiful place, but owner's son cursed out a whispering girl and her friend. Went to see Chuchito Valdes on Saturday and it was an amazing show! The venue is ?nice. The place was intimate and a perfect place for such an amazing show. I don't know how the cocktail waitress was able to make sure we were taken care of and she was phenomenal and attentive. I have seen Chuchito multiple times and he is very interactive with the audience. He asks the audience to interact and was so excited to see him!Problem: ?A man who claimed to be the son's owner was verbally abusive and cursed myself and ?a group of females, telling us individually to ?Shut the f*** up. Mind you, if he thought we were loud he could say, Hey, please stop speaking until the set's over  ?and we would have been like, a"
"This was our second visit to Sunda and it was as great as the first time, if not better. ��We celebrated the 15th annniversary of our first date--and the food and atmosphere were just perfect. ��Service was terrific, the food was unique and yummy, and the personal service was unforgettable--particularly the Ridiculous dessert we were surprised with from management in honor of our big day. ��I highly recommend Sunda to anybody who loves food and a great atmosphere that showcases Chicago culinary at its fineset."
"I don't think I ever left this place dissapointed.And I had a lot of different things.A couple days ago,just out of curiousity,I got a corn dog.I despise corn dogs with all of my heart,and I can only remember having one corn dog that I actually enjoyed (that was back when I was a kid).Goddammit,Hot Dougs.I'm addicted to your corn dogs now."
"Every holiday and birthday, my 3 sons, husband and I make our regular jaunt to Wildfire Chicago for the most delicious and oh-so-cozy ambiance of Wildfire. I always get the coconut crusted shrimp...a must have. The desserts are always delicious, but the sweet potatoes could be dessert in themselves. Say hi to John at the host stand, he's the best!"
"This is definitely a bar that I would classify as hip and for the cool crowd. I went here with a bunch of my friends one Friday night and it was a great place to hang out. The bar is reasonably priced and has more selections of beer than I ever thought could exist. Some of the customers at Hopleaf were a little sketchy. That night I went was also one of the most bizzare nights of my life when a party of about 10 little people, all of whom were guys, ?kept hitting on all of the girls in the bar, occasionally attempting to grope. They were kicked out eventually but it was pretty disgusting for the time that it lasted. I think they all were drunk. Otherwise, a great place!"
Wow....try their Italian Beef and Giardiniera Pizza......out of this world. thats all I have to say.
The Ultimate Hot Dog Superstore. ��Love it!
"This place is delicious. ��I loved that my server was well inclined on the home brews. ��I told her what flavors I was looking for, and that is exactly what I got. ��Got some great zas and a salad. ��The salad was not too good, but the beer and pizza were outstanding!"
"A veggie burrito for under $5. Are you kidding me? And BYOB. Are you serious? I love this place. I have dreams about this place. The food caters to the most voracious carnivores, yet also offers a wide variety of authentic Costa Rican food for those veggie lovers. The empanadas are some of the best around!"
"4.5 hours of my life that I won't be able to get back.For some context, I was with a party of 6 sitting at an upstairs round table. ��We dropped roughly $140/head and are a fairly laid-back group of people. I'll get through the positives first, then on to the real story:1) Pleasant architectural setting2) Cool rooftop bar3) Unique drink selection4) Items at the serve-yourself Harvest Bar section were solidNow...the stuff you should know. 1) Service was horrible. ��I'm not even really sure why we had a waitress b/c it took over 1/2 hour to deliver a simple drink and she had absolutely no control over the food being delivered to our table. ��Seriously, at one point I just went downstairs to the bar to order. ��She smiled. She was nice. ��But she really made things worse rather than better. ��Oh, a"
"Mmmmmm. ��I love a good hotdog, but a hotdog is not a Superdawg and the word great is saved for a Superdawg. ��By far the best dawg in Chicago, I highly recommend to anyone who has not been to this Chicago landmark. ��When you see the huge dawgs on the roof, you have made it.Superdawg offers the rare experience of a drive-in, food brought to you by carhops, and a way to keep unruly kids distracted by a dvd and out of the public eye. ��The Superburger/Supercheesies make it as much a burger as a dawg place, and the fries are the best I have ever had. ��Luckily for all of us, they come with every meal ordered. ��The shakes and malts are amazing as well, but amazing describes everything i have had there. ��It is really no suprise to me when I regularly see Superdawg on the Travel Channel and Food Net"
Best Pizza in Chicago hands down...their house salad also has an awesome dressing. ��Check out their lunch deal on weekdays...amazing bargain...just 4.95 for a personal pizza and a beer!
So nice to have a yummy Vegetarian restaurant with vegan options as well. ��Entrees are full of flavor and great portion sizes! ��I am not a strict vegetarian but appreciate the different options instead of everything just soy. ��The Gyros is my favorite!
This is the only place in the world where I can eat eggplant. My fav is the Salmon and Adass Polo and Kash-ke. The selection of wines is awesome too. The Riesling is gr8! They don't take reservations but if its a big group and you call in advance the staff will take care of you. Love this family owned restaurant they made us feel at home!
Outdoor patio is lovely. The food very underwhelming. The antipasto special was average. The prosciutto was not very flavorful and vegetables were only ok. The risotto special was very good but the pappardelle was bland. The atmosphere is really nice but for the price the food was disappointing.
"This was a huge disappointment. I did not have any expectations because this a gathering to celebrate a special occasion and I was just along for the ride, but we had a party of 9 with a reservation. The place is extremely dark (what are they hiding?) and tight. They pack you in there and I seriously can't imagine they have not had any lawsuits with all the flames and oil flying around. The prices were outrageous. I find it amazing they charge $40 + for them to put the raw food in front of you so you can cook it yourself. They seem to pride themselves on the premium seafood and meat. It's too bad that it gets ruined by having to cook it in oil. And it's so damn dark that you can not see if your food is actually cooked or not! Nice effect. Beside the horrible seating (chairs look to have be"
Fantastic location -- great food too. I admit I'm not much of a fish-freak but I almost always get a cup of chowder with any entree. The spinach salad tends to take care of the rest of my tummy on my behalf.One of my favourite haunts -- and when it's summer and the patio is open -- ah! I could live at Glenn's :)
I have been going to Nuevo Leon for over 20 years and must say that the food and service have gone down hill. ��I made the trip to buy 3 orders of steak fajitas and found that 1 of the orders did not have the steak just veggies. ��When I called they made me feel like I was trying to cheat them. ��I won't be going back.
Great neighborhood brunch spot. Be prepared to wait but well worth it! ��The menu has so many unique options - the pear french toast with vanilla sauce was phenomenal.
"This place clearly does not need another review. ��However, I'll add my two cents because this is the best sushi I've had in Chicago so far. ��I eat sushi everywhere I go, and I recognize that sushi is not the highlight of the restaurant scene in Chicago. ��But Coast is definitely an exception to that rule. ��I usually lean towards more sashimi than rolls because the fish is so good at Coast. ��They do, however, have their fair share of more complicated rolls. ��Both ends of the spectrum are great. ��After eating great sushi for several years, I'm rarely surprised. ��Coast surprised me. ��I always thought red tuna was always superior to white tuna. ��That was before I had some melt-in-your-mouth white tuna at Coast. ��Maybe I got lucky that day, but it's a testament to the quality of fish Coast gets,"
I did the call in/pick up and knew from the moment I walked in the food was going to be exquisite. ?Tea was offered as I waited and the wonderful staff went out of their way to make sure I had reading material and was comfortable for the 5 minute wait. ?Once I got home we couldn't believe how thoughtfully the food was prepared/packed. ?But once we began to enjoy the food we kept looking at each other and saying Mmmmmm! ?This is THE ONLY place for for wonderfully delicious you won't be disappointed food!
One of the best places to grab food at if you have a morning hangover. ��Great pho is a cure it all.
"Hipsters Haven and Phenomenal! ��Myself and a couple of my buddies dropped in here on a Friday night...the thin crust pizza is quite tasty, all fresh ingredients...paired with the best brew in the city (Go Dark N Curvy), you can not go wrong with this place!"
So finally we tried it. What people say about Demera is true.The food is so good. a Bit pricey but definitely worth it.We order from them on a busy saturday. They came like 15mn late (an hour instead of the usual 45mn). They gave us the food for free!Now that's what I call customer service :)
atmosphere was great and ��in addition the food was great! although i had to wait an hour with my friends it was still a great place!! pretty good cuban food ! the food was a lot similar to one of my best friends mom back in LA ... her mom (cuban) was a great cook !!
"Too crowded, no reservations taken, rude waiters, waiting time to get a table over one hour, attitude, snobs. You can get better service in so many other places. Customer service sucks. Would not recommend this place."
"Perhaps we went on an off night. The decor is amazing - so fun, and inspires a party atmosphere right away. The staff are polite & the hostess made a point to check on our table a few times. They were out of guacamole, however, which seemed amazing. How can you be out of guac when half of your menu includes it? The waitress said they couldn't find avacados anywhere...The entrees and sweets were tasty, and the drinks were ok. I ordered a mango papaya thing and it was pretty fibrous. Overall, fun place with good food.Great for a large group."
"The salad bar is my favorite part, so fresh!"
I love yolk and always take guests when they come visit from out of town! Its a great deal for the amount of food you get and the quality!
"One of the best low key breakfast/sandwich places! They have an amazing yogurt parfait with their own home made granola!They have a really good french toast if you don't mind gaining a few extra pounds, but it isn't overwhelmingly sweet either!Really great baked items and super sandwiches! Try it out!"
"I love everything about this place. Awesome food, good serving sizes, and wonderful drunk inducing drinks. All the best you could ask for from a vegetarian restaurant. On top of all of this, the service, even when slow, is among the nicest and most genuine I have ever experienced. I find most of the other reviews here shocking, as all are completely contrary to anything I have ever experienced. The only downfall would be that they mopped the floor around my table the last time I was there and covered my coat in bleach mop water, thanks."
Living in Chicago I love to try all the pizza places. ��For thin crust this is by far the top pizza in Chicago.
"Love this place, ��beer list is incredible. ��They even have my favorite beer on tap Little Sumpin Sumpin which was best beer at beerfest in Madison Wisconsin last year. ��Love mussels also.Only drawbacks are getting a table since its always packed, and also no tvs (I know, I know some people hate tvs but I am into sports)."
"I'm completely baffled by all the good reviews for this restaurant. ��I've been to this restaurant three times and I never had good food there.I came here last week for dinner and decided that it would be my last time there. ��We ordered some very standard Korean dishes - jap chae, yukgaejang, and ddukguk, and they were all really disgusting. ��The jap chae looked like it had been sitting all day. ��It was very limp and not fresh. ��The first thing we noticed about the yukgaejang and ddukguk was the rancid smell. ��I can give a bit of a handicap for the yukgaejang because there are many different ways to make it and most places don't make it well. ��But the beef obviously was not fresh. ��The smell was very bad and the soup itself was mediocre at best, though it's hard to really gauge since the sm"
"Unarguably my favorite place ever. I have been here over half a dozen times, and will always bring someone from out of town here for an incredible dinner. Everything is cooked to perfection. Service is amazing. Well worth the $50 per person. Personal favorites include: Bacon Wrapped Filet Mignon and the Rack of Lamb."
"The Appetizers were awesome. Flat Bread and an unusual Mushroom dish. The main course that I tried was a vegetarian dish - Ravioli stuffed with some kind of sweet (Pumpkin?) paste. Was wholesome and tasty, may be a bit too sweet for my taste.Overall I felt very good about eating here.. will definitely go back and will bring out of towners whenever!!Wish they had more vegetarian options!"
"Ever so delicious. Just as incredible as they say. Best service I've had, made me and my wife feel like king and queen. Like royalty. Well worth the bill."
"Love this restaurant! Everything they serve is delicious! I often order the combination plate which comes with tons of excellent rice, white or dill and chicken, koubideh and shish kabob! Yummy!Can't wait to come in again. Try the persian salad!"
"Different, fun and most importantly delicious. The chocolate desert at the end is amazing!"
"The entrees are deeeeeeeelish. The staff is about as wonderful and accommodating as staff could be. Deserts were a little mediocre but above all I had a wonderful first experience. I am also glad someone else paid because from what I could tell it was pretttttty expensive. If someone offers to take me, I'd definitely return!"
"new oatmeal stout is amazing. ��We had a party of 8 and they found a way to accomodate us even though our full party was not there for quite awhile. ��Food was fantastic. ��Great hamburger with creamy gorgonzola and fried onion. ��Everyone else enjoyed the food as well. ��Love the selection of beer between there crafted brews and of course the guest beers they have as well. ��Great energy, fun place. ��5 for beer, 4 for food but overall with the energy and friendliness they deserve a 5."
Had a nice lunch here. But have had better Mexican at small authentic places. Service was a little uncomfortable.
"First and last time here. The food is decent, but as soon as you sit at the table you can notice how uncomfortable ��the chairs are and the ��tables are tiny. ��We had a server which was very polite but he pushed us to give him the full order when we ask to start with some appetizers! We said, sorry we don't know yet, can we start with some appetizers? And he said, sorry but the chef would like to have the full order! Wow, who is the customer here? At the end we eat, feeling a little uncomfortable, the food was OK but not ��great, and the final check was way too high for the quality of service and food. Definitively not coming back"
"a week ago, this would have been a 5star review. i really dig their pastries and i'm a closet-NesCafe-drinker, so that's all good... but the dinner food....... ehhhh.... where to start? who has a dinner menu, but doesn't have the food listed ready by 6P? they do... ordered the goat cheese appetizer (totally acceptable, btw! ask for pita instead of the toast that comes with it!), and for dinner, my guy asked for no dairy to be served with his meat; our illustrious server proceeded to ask - in all seriousness - if he knew that goat cheese had dairy in it... people, let's try not to flaunt sheltered ignorance, no? the chicken raganatti = meh; it was edible, but i wouldn't order it again. sorta dry, sorta bland actually. breakfast? NesCafe? yeah - i will be here again; dinner - nah. there are "
"I am a huge Brazilian steakhouse fan and frequent to one of the main four (Chama, Texas, Brazzaz, Fogo) on a regular basis. When it comes to service and quality of the food, Fogo stands tall above its competitors. The menus in all of the steakhouses are very similar, but the taste is distinctly better at Fogo. It is slightly more expensive, but definitely worth the extra penny."
Fantastic. Thats all.
"i love this restaurant. ��it is amazing, everything is good there. ��it is nice to know that you can have different kind og meats to choose from. When you flip your card to greent food is coming your way. I am not one of these people that like to check all the restaurants, but I am glad I went to this place. In my opinion this is one of the best restaurants in Chicago."
"Interesting place - Here's my opinion...Went there on 1st date and was very happy with atmosphere and overall vibe of room. ��The place is beautiful. ��As far as the food, it's not an easy menu to order from and I didn't have a real good connection with the waiter. ��I started going with a few of his recommendations and was not happy.Very strange that our coats were tossed on top of the hostess stand -Bottomline I had a nice time - glad I went, doubt I'll go back."
"Quality Mexican cuisine - tasty and spicy, and delicious desserts (fortunately, they are not spicy:) )."
"Slippin! �� Just went here the other night with some friends, I was craving the Ropa Viejo that I had last time but it was not the same. ��The overall experience was...... AH-just ok. ��The service was just ""alright"" and the food was mixed all around. ��Even the empanadas, which I was really looking forward to, were soggy and kind of bland."
this is simply the best mexican food that you will ever eat. hands down the best fajitas ever along with the best beans in pilsen . dont forget the hand made flour tortillas . if you want good mexican food this is the place ( alot of other restaurant owners once worked at nuevo leon )why not check out where the learned the tricks of the trade. ohh dont forget byob.
"Pretty good.......for vegetarian food!I came in here not knowing that the vast majority of their menu is vegetarian. I got hummus for an appetizer (great!) and the buffalo wrap as an entre (very ok). However, being a vegetarian place, I was surprised at the variety of food available on their menu. I'll definitely suggest this to my vegetarian friends and take them here whenever they visit! I'm not sure I'd come back here in the near future, due to my love for the meat but i thought i'd push it to 4 stars for being vegetarian friendly!"
"If you've tasted REAL pizza napoletana in ITALY, this is the only place that comes the closest. ?Great environment, the owner is nice and so is the service. ?A little on the pricey side BUT very worth it. ?Ingredients are fresh...OOOH the mozarella!! ?This is not AMERICAN pizza, so don't come here expecting thick, fat, a la Giordano's style. ?This place is phenomenal!! ?It's always busy but choose your hours or call for a reservation."
"I only take the time to write a review when a place either amazes me or ticks me off ... you know how it goes.This place amazes me!! The food is ridiculously authentic. Great great service. A great value and beautiful atmosphere. Usually Mexican restaurants leave much to be desired when it comes to decor and cleanliness unfortunately, but The Palace (I like to call it) does not. It is so so clean and the decor is very cool and appropriate.If you like Mole' or even if you don't this is the place to try it. MMmmmm. Just like it should be made .. finally! ��The Margaritas are stupid good and the simple lime is my favorite. Why complicate a good thing? Really, I travel to Mexico and lived in New Mexico - these are authentic drinks.The service can be a bit shy, probably due to some language barr"
"Let me start this review and say that I LOVE the food here. The ropa vieja is especially delicious--very tender compared to the other Cuban restaurants in that area. If a review was based on food only, I'd give it an enthusiastic five stars. However, I have to warn people not to bring a group here. I reserved a table here about three weeks in advance of a group outing. We arrived and the table had a messy scattering of forks and a few random glasses. We had to practically beg to get silverware and wine glasses for the whole party. We also had to share menus. The waiter pretty much avoided our table most of the night. It took over an hour to get our appetizers and our entrees arrived about an hour and fifteen minutes after we had ordered them. We had to bolt our food and get out for the nex"
"The service at Fox and Obel is terrible. ��One employee at the bakery section always pretends to be busy so she does not have to slice my bread. ��The customer service counter has rude employees who don't listen to what the issue is. ��They seem to like to talk amongst themselves rather than work. ��One cashier is out of tune to what is happening. ��She can hold up the line for 1 customer while others wait and has no sense of time. BTW, the sushi is fake. And the prepared food section is essentially high priced left-overs."
"I come here to get away from my usual's in Lakeview. ��You only have a few choices if you're looking for a place to study, sip coffee and surf the internet for free around here. ��You have Alliance, Lovely or Ballou to pick from. ��I'm thankful some places still provide free wifi with their coffee. ��Alliance is a bakery, everything else comes second. ��The study room next door is not really a cafe because you'll be stared at or hushed if you talk out loud. ��Make sure your notebook is fully charged before you head here because outlets can be scarce. If you want to chat with friends and don't need free internet you are better off going to Milk & Honey further down, or Starbucks across the street, or better yet, try Letizia's."
"Such a bad service,Slow, unhelpfull, unkind, without supervision.Don't bring here someone you want to impress about Colombia's restaurants.We just went yesterday for lunch, 5 persons.* waiter never came to our table to ask ""is everything ��ok?""* when we needed to order more (drinks,deserts,etc.) have to wait too long to call their attention.* They don't know how to say ""would you like more coffee?"" (neither english nor spanish)* We requested an extra fork and the answer was ""another??""* My sister in law asked the waiter to describe their stake and he say ""is �� stake, that's what the menu says""* There is nobody overseeing the operations on the floor to make sure all the patrons are having a good experience.* Our menu didn't have the prices printed, we paid over $100+ tip* Had to wait too lon"
Worth the wait..great dogs
"Fifty's got a great sidewalk seating section, good drink deals ($1 bottles on Mondays!), friendly (and hot) staff, and far-beyond average bar food. ��Everything on the menu is pretty good. ��Three unique levels, and Playboy covers in the bathroom. ��The only downside is the clientele runs toward the fratty / douchey, if you let that bother you."
"We've been Frontera fans since it opened in 1987. Our most recent visit last Saturday - a surprisingly warm evening in Chicago and we sat outside in the early evening. The experience, as always, was exemplary - we had a new server but she was extremely solicitous and knowledgeable. Jill, the sommelier, recommended a spectacular Chilean cabernet that actually made a great match with the wild B.C. salmon dish on the specials roster. The little Mexico City quesadillas to start are basic but terrific as were the taquitos. Frontera is loud, bustling, a bit chaotic from time to time but if you surrender to the experience you will have the time of your life. If you're familiar with Americanized Tex Mex -go beyond the basics (enchiladas, tacos al carbon), and try whatever Rick's doing with duck, p"
"By far the best, most authentic chicago hot dog experience in the city of chicago. i love knowing that everytime i bring friends to dougs - i see the man himself - doug taking our order. you MUST go on Friday for duck fat french fry day! ��the line looks long, but moves fast. if you can get there before 11...you won't have a wait."
"Good food, but in a few words: TOO MANY KIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ��What is with parents these days. ��I pay good money for a quiet, comfortable breakfast and instead I am bombarded with the loud offspring of rude parents. ��I probably won't be back. ��If you go, request a QUIET area away from the screaming brats."
"I took my husband and his best friend out for their birthdays last Saturday to Brazzaz and boy was it great. The food was great ��and the services were fantastic. These are two guys that is hard to fill up, but this place did the trick. The atmosphere was great and my server, I wish I could remember his name was very attentive."
"The amazing cocktails are works of beauty. Hush and Wonder is my signature drink now, so much so that a bottle of Creme De Violette is my go-to hostess gift, thus ensuring a Hush and Wonder knockoff from those who know me well. Dark and Stormy is another favorite and inspired me to use more ginger in my own creations. Juliet and Romeo is a fail proof summer fling drink; relaxing, unusual, a hint of flowers and the comforting kick of gin. The phone free ambiance and spare sensual decor are well worth the visit, but once you've sipped these cocktails, you'll thank yourself for forging through the hipsters out there to the sanctuary inside."
"i am strictly referring to the turkey reuben. ��i have been eating here for ten years, and although i wish other aspects of their menu would change, i am thrilled that they have not changed this sandwich. ��it has never once disappointed. ��worth driving across town to get. ��i prefer the thousand island on the side, but what do i know."
"This was the single best, most memorable, eye-opening, and flavorful culinary experience I have ever had. As a teacher, my salary does not allow for frequent dining splurges, but I try I find a way to visit some of the country's best restaurants when I can (Chez Pannise, Fench Laundry, etc.). My visit to Alinea was SO worth the penny pinching needed to go there. So if you are like me and wondering if it is worth the money....DO IT. Also, for so upscale a restaurant the service was friendly and playful, not stuffy at all. We ordered the smaller tasting menu, which did not include the truffle explosion. When I called in advance to see if I could add that dish (indicating I would be happy to pay more) they said it was no problem. Not only did they include the extra dish, they didn't even char"
"My favorite sushi in Chicago. Period. Some of my go-to's are....spicy miso soup, sashimi plate, spicy creamy roll, and spicy tuna."
"seated 30 minutes after reservationsecond course took 30 minutes after first coursefish was dryroasted vegetables looked, felt and tasted like soggy french friessalad not any better than what I could have made at homemusic loud enough to drown conversation$70 - not including drinks obviously won't be back here."
"It's not often that I describe a burger as melting in my mouth, but the Slow Burn burger did just that. Even as a spice lover I was a bit intimidated by the list of peppers topping the burger but the combination of flavors was perfect. So perfect that I stuck around and let a dozen exotic beers melt in my mouth too."
We went there with good friends at 6pm on a Saturday night. There was an open table and we were told that they were keeping it open in case a larger party showed up. We waited and watched. The table stayed empty for the entire time we waited for a smaller table. The host and and the manager were two of the most obnoxious people EVER. Arrogant and rude doesn't cut it in the restaurant business.AWFUL. AWFUL. AWFUL.
one of my favorites in the entire city
"love the concept, hate the place! I am sure the one in NY suits its neighborhood better! Overpriced. Under deserving of many stars. Good staff. Mike is an excellent bartender! I live down the street and have not had a desire to go back! Gimmicky in my opinion and trying just a little too hard. Maybe they could have gotten away with their theme and goals in Lincoln Park, but I am just so over overly pretentious people!!! We are breathe and defecate the same thing, so why must there be a set of rules prior to entering the place?!? Money is green regardless right?????? I shouldn't be complaining, because they treated me like royalty, but I just can't respect discrimination in any form, whether its covert or not and I really have a problem with their rules. The place isn't conducive to sociali"
"This whole in the wall is classy and has a great menu. If I just want a small plate or just want a simple glass of wine, this is the new place on Michigan Ave! Beets and Beers, they have a great menu hands down!"
"I've only been here once, but my experience was fantastic! We were immediately seated and our waitress always tended to our drinks whenever needed. When I went we got the roasted duck meal where they slice it right at your table. The duck was absolutely amazing and it is now my favorite meal. I have never had such a fabulous duck. The meat was perfect and the sauce it came with made it ten times better. I definitely would like to come back here soon!"
"We love this place! ?So let me breakdown the main course part of the menu... there are two sections De Cuba and Estilo Nuevo. ?I'm not gonna pretend to know what they mean (though I'm venturing something from Cuba and something new...hehe). The impression we got was the De Cuba list offered more authentic, home-cooked type dishes. ?If you're in the mood for something a bit upscale and unique, order from Estilo Nuevo...and you won't be disappointed.The Honey Jalapeno pork chops are fantastic and generous portions would be an understatement. ?They give you two HUGE pork chops where one of them would be enough (leftovers!!).The Blackened Duck is probably my favorite dish. ?Though, not quite as large as the pork chops, it is simply delicious. ?Tenderly cooked meat packed with tons of flavor.Th"
"I am writing this months after i ate here, but this was the most perfect meal I have ever had. ��I went with two of my friends and we all got the tour menu. ��Service was spot on and more importantly, the flavors were spot on. ��Of the 26 items that I ate, i liked all of them except for one, and that's because it had white asparagus in it. ��I just personally don't like white asparagus, but i know enough about food to know that the flavors in the dish work well together and taste good together. ��I did drop a bundle on the meal, but it was well worth it. ��Don't worry about the price, go to Alinea for the experience."
"Las Tablas is a very appealing place to dine. The food is amazing decor is simple,and the prices are reasonable. I dine at Las Tablas whenever i can."
"What the....?!?! Brunch buffet only on Sundays? Seems like they're missing a good opportunity by not having it on Saturday as well.That said, the buffet is great! Try the French toast. For lunch or dinner the fish tacos are great."
"THE best pizza in Chicago. We dont even bother with any other deep dish places anymore. This is our only option.Love everything about it. The carmelized cheesy crust, sauce, toppings...The upstairs area is so much more appealing now after the renovation. They have plenty of seating now and 2 full bars. Perfect place to go before a movie at Webster Place!"
"Not sure why my review wasn't posted, but I like this place so much I wanted to repost it."
"tea was great, cheap food with large portions. It was average taste wise for the curry chicken."
"Nuevo Leon is a Mexican restaurant in the heart of Pilsen with lots of 'sabor' (flavor), a nice selection and excellent prices. ��We ordered the enchiladas suizas ($6 per entree) with the fried beans and the rice and they were delicious. ��One can taste the fresh ingredients in each bite. ��The waitress was very welcoming; she brought us crispy tortilla chips, a bowl of fresh salsa, and a bowl of pickled chilles and carrots. ��We were also served a complimentary appetizer that was very delicate in flavor and very delish! ��Are we going back for more? Absolutely! ��So should you."
"Every time we go, I can't make up my mind and want to try at least 4 different things. ��The wild game sausages squick me out a bit so I don't get those. ��Sure, waiting in line is sometimes a pain - but it's also part of the fun. ��If you don't want to wait in line, don't go here. ��Plain and simple - it's not for everyone.No matter how crowded it is, they always manage to help you find a place to sit. ��The staff is friendly and I like that Doug insists on running the register and interacting with customers."
"I just came back from a terrific culinary experience at this Cuban restaurant, and I wanted to express my sincerest appreciation for a delicious meal in a wonderful atmosphere. Upon entering I was immediately greeted and was offered seating both indoors and outside. The ambiance is 100% Cuban, with ethnic music being played in a perfect manner (not to loud, not too soft). My waitress, Sarah, was both professional and down-to-earth, and we had great conversations throughout our visit. The owner, Alberto, was present, and he made his rounds, checking to see if everything was satisfactory. I thought it was an excellent touch, because he was very humble and appreciative. Naturally, the food itself was amazing! It is prepared with care, and it is served proudly. My sandwich and appetizers were "
INCREDIBLE. By far the best pizza and chicken in town owned by the nicest people. Keep it up.
"Had the bbq chicken pizza here on friday and it was delicious. ��The pizza here is thin crust only and the menu is exstensive. ��Whether you are feeling reserved or really adventurous they seemed to have everything to fit any taste. �� �� We went with the x large pizza between two people and finished the entire thing so if you are bringing an appetite dont go with the medium as the pizza itself is light so going through multiple slices is no problem. ��Definetly recommend. ��One thing if you are planning on coming here, the dining space is small so carry out or delivery is you're best bet."
This place has great food but watch out they will trick you on your bill in every which way. Oh thy hate Groupons! One day they told me they wont accept Groupon unless we pay with one card. Ya there was 12 people in our party. Another time server said Groupon is for cash paying customers only. Today my wife tried making reservations & they are all booked but they will grant us the use of our Groupon on take out but will charge us extra 18% gratuity. 18% GRATUITY ON A TAKE OUT???? I'm staring to hate this place!
Love the place...Go there anytime..u'll get a good selection of Beer.Few of friends were visiting from out of town...so I took'em to Hopleaf.. As always..great times!! I am sure 500+ reviews say it all.I am a big fan of this place!!Highly recommended for beer lovers!
"I had a bad experience with delivery here a few weekends ago and got a cold, soggy pizza. This was after several orders of hot delicious pizza, so we blamed it on being a football Sunday and decided not to order it again.They saw my negative review on Yelp and offered a full refund on the pizza, no questions asked. My faith was restored. This is definitely the kind of personal service you won't get from a big chain.We'll definitely be ordering again, but maybe not during such a hectic time because we do know their pizzas are delish, but the place is small."
"On the plus side, food was great, so good that I didn't mind the price too much. We had reservations so we were seated immediately. The service was also good, not particularly attentive but quite adequate.Negative - the reason for the one star rating - the nauseatingly loud music. You can't hold a normal conversation even across your tiny, wobbly and cramped table. What is the rational for music that leaves you ��with ringing ears and a headache? I'll not be returning, which is too bad because I would have enjoyed exploring the menu."
"Love, love, love it. Gotta go when in Chi-town"
This place is so good. Order the pepito! ��It can be well worth the wait
"I'm not a thin crust kinda girl but the pizza here doesn't need a thick crust. It can stand on it's own two legs!Great pizza, great beer, great service! Sometimes you have to wait awhile to get a table but it's worth it. I hope to catch a game here sometime soon."
"My husband and I go here whenever we are in the area. ��They have a great selection of beers on tap, and the wine list is fantastic. �� We usually order the scottish egg to start, and sometimes the oysters, which are always fabulous! �� The entrees are always delicious and the service is just short of perfect. ��I love the atmosphere-clean, with dark wood, ceramic tiles, soft lighting."
"I wandered in here for breakfast one day, and lived to regret it. Nothing against the waitstaff, but the food was worse than mediocre, and the prices were extortionist.I ordered the tofu scramble, which came with tortillas, black beans (tasted like they were straight out of a can) and veggie chorizo (again, straight out of the package, by flavor). At one point, I asked for extra corn tortillas. Big mistake. When I got the bill, those two tortillas cost me $2. Seriously? $2 for two corn tortillas? No restaurant has even ever charged me for extra tortillas before, they're so cheap. At Cermak, you could get 40 tortillas for $2... And, speaking of extortion, the bottomless, diner-quality coffee is $3. What if you just want a small coffee? Too bad, you will still pay $3, and there's no decaf av"
"The waiter was great......attentive, but not pushy at all. The food was absolutely delicious and I loved the ambiance. the only problem was the water from the cups dripping on my dress(due to where I was seated at the table), but I mean, no big deal! Overall, a fantastic find!"
"Absolutely loved it. Amazing food and perfect service. We weren't crazy about the first bottle of wine we ordered and the waiter insisted we find another one without being charged. The antipasti were fantastic- peppers with breadcrumbs, caponata, and the grilled octopus was hands down the best I've ever had. My boyfriend marveled at how much I ate, given my propensity to pretend I'm some sort of eating disorder afflicted supermodel while we dine out. Let me assure you there was no trips to the bathroom for cocaine and purging this night! But I digress...My ball and chain had spaghetti amatriciana which was simple yet flavorful, and I had the goat cheese ravioli in a light buttery sauce with orange zest and fennel pollen. Unusual and unbelievably delicious.We had to dash before desert, whic"
My family went here looking for some good Chicago deep dish pizza. ��This was the best deep dish pizza I have ever had..!!! ��We went on a week night and the service was excellent. ��Very friendly staff. ��It does take a little longer because the pizza takes about 35 minutes to cook. It was well worth the wait.. Will be returning on are next trip to Chicago.
i have been going to gejas for many years. i enjoy the different sauces that accompany the food and also the nice wine selections. i always recommend it to family and friends as the primary place for authentic fondue.
"I was pretty excited to score a Groupon to Fox & Obel because I knew my foodie husband would LOVE it. ��Sadly, F & O just isn't what it used to be. ��Once upon a time, they were the only gourmet food show in town, but now there is just too much competition and the folks at F & O just don't seem to care a whit.We came to buy 'picnic' food for a family outing to Lincoln Park Zoo and were really happy with our purchases: Olive ciabatta rolls, roasted turkey breast, gypsy salami, gruyere, rosemary and olive oil chips, cookies and drinks... yep, for $50.00. ��The service was mixed - the young African-American man at the deli was rude and acted like we were inconveniencing him by ordering. ��Sorry for asking you to do your job, pal. ��None of the random store employees in the near empty store greeted"
"If you like crowds and overpriced Dominick's deli fare, by all means drop by The Purple Pig. There was not a single meat or cheese on the menu that stood out as unique. �� I could put together a better charcuterie spread at home with a quick stop at nearby Fox and Obel. ��If you do stop by, skip the deep fried deviled egg. ��The deep fried brussel sprouts were the highlight of this mediocre, over-priced meal. There is nothing special about The Purple Pig."
"Wow... this place was absolutely incredible!! We just walked in, the hostesses were very friendly to us, sat us right away at a booth along the wall. We both ordered cocktails (I got the Deaths Door Daisy!! mmmmmm) and our server treated us better than we could have even asked for.My boyfriend and I started off with the shaved salad, which must have been the best salad I've ever had. I especially loved the beets! Who would have thunk? Then we tried a couple different dishes: the blackened cauliflower was great, with the garlic mashed potatoes. Then we tried the purist pasta (simple, but delicious),and ?the maple bourbon pork roast with lentils was seriously heaven on earth (I could eat that for every meal of every day forever).So when our server asked us if we wanted dessert... what were w"
If you're young and you appreciate good asian fusion you should definitely come here! the only bad thing about this restaurant is trying to find a reservation! Their food is excellent and their sushi is also quite good! Very hip and young crowd! servers are generally nice.
"piece out should be called piece of sh..............I have never been so disgusted and offended in all my dining experience in my life. Not only by the general manager bob, but also by the owner bill jacobs.......I was there having lunch with my family, mind you this place is a sports bar, not fine dining..it was loud , that we could barely hear ourselves, with the soccer games playing and people eating and drinking , when the gm came up to our table and asked us to keep our baby quiet because he was making too much noise..My bay is 1 and a half yrs. I was so offended by thier rudeness. not only are they not kid friendly, they are rude as hell and the food is horrible....they will never get my business and will pass the word on. not to mention me and my fiance both work in the restaurant i"
"I don't need to say much about this place - it's totally ��tongue blowing. The place is clean, ambiance is real great. Plus my favorite would definitely be the food. Just remembering it right now makes me drool. You can try it out but I have to say to not come on the weekends. It's full and a little crowded."
"This Place is Great! One of my Favorite Italian restaurants. They have ��awesome ribs special Sunday - Wednesday. ��I mean its pretty reasonable and you get a choice of soup or salad and a side of pasta with your order.Lasty, they have a huge Free Parking lot, which is kind of a rarity for a city restaurant."
"we went on Sat 5/29/10 as walk ins and had to wait over 1 hour to be seated. the best thing our group of 4 did was walk to Havana bar, literally the next block south on Clark and had our Mojitos there with a small appetizer. the server seemed like he was impatient with our order and would roll his eyes when we would ask to repeat a question b/c we were unclear about some things and even when we chose to not order dessert. the trio ceviche was definitely worth it. the icing on the cake for this awful rating was when my husband was eating the left overs the next day, he almost broke his tooth biting on a ROCK! seriously, it was a medium size pebble, and makes you wonder how it got there. so after all that is said and done, we can check Rick Bayless' restaurant off our Chicago to-do list, but"
"Went here a couple months ago and fell in love with the gnocci pasta! I went back a few weeks ago, only to order the gnocci pasta and find out it was completely different! It was no where near as good, I was very disappointed. I could hardly eat any of it it tasted so bad.Other than my horrible gnocci experience, the bread with sweet vinegar is to die for, as is the St. Germain lemon drink. I also love the ice cream!"
"French/ Vietnamese cuisine!!!?? Even though I had read pretty good yelp reviews on this place, I still was a tad skeptical. However I always have an open mind and I enjoy trying new/unusual places. My fiance took me here for my birthday. I was absolutely impressed with the decor and ambiance... Beautiful and romantic! Candles EVERYWHERE! : ) I felt like I stepped back in time and was in some tropical/exotic place. Our server Angela was very nice, informative and helpful w/ recommending items from the menu. I ordered the lychee sangria, very tasty. For appetizers/entrees we ordered the Pho soup (very very good), Seafood bouillabaisse (ok, but I prob wouldn't order it again. It doesn't live up to all the hype it gets), and the BBQ pork (my favorite out of all the things we ordered). For dess"
"I have been to Sunda three times and each and every time it was fantastic. ��The impeccable service, the amazing environment, and the out of this world food make Sunda my favorite restaurant. ��Each time I go I try something new (while still getting some favorites) & am always impressed. ��The wait staff go out of their way to make sure you know exactly what you're ordering and really take the time to make you feel like you're their only client. ��I've been raving about it to friends for months & it honestly lives up to all the hype and expectations!"
"Met up for lunch here with a buddy while on a business trip. ��If you want their deep dish (which is what I've been told their famous for, you'll need to plan some time. ��The deep dish takes 40 minutes to cook, but definitely worth the wait. ��Be sure to order right when you get it.Haven't been eating a ton of pizza lately, but this was totally worth the splurge."
"This was my first time eating here, as it was recommended by a security guard at the sear tower. Omg,...i cant thank him enough! I absolutely LOVE this place. The pizza was deep dish, the tomato sauce was not to think and not to thin, with a great flavor. the chesse was stringy, and im a chesse lover! this was the best pizza i have ever tasted. ��You may purchase pizza online,...visit http://www.giordanos.com,..travelled in 2008"
"Simply put, the best Vietnamese food I have ever had in Chicago. I was a fan of Pasteur, and Simply It follows veteran owner Tuan's signature style of inventive, delicious food. Conveniently located in Lincoln Park, the restaurant's decor is warm contemporary. BYOB and close proximity to nearby bars makes this restaurant a great start to a night out. Still working out a few kinks in service, but overall outstanding value and great food. Highly recommended."
"This is a really good Restaurant. It can be hard sometimes to find decent vegetarian food but everything on the menu at the Chicago Diner is really good. The place is kind of small, which means you have to wait for a table, and the service isn't always all that fantastic. But the food always makes up for any other problems I come across. Great place, I definitely recommend it"
"While the food was good, the service was worse than terrible. It started with the host and continued on until after we left. �� I have never encountered such a rude server, who so obviously wanted my party to leave from the moment we sat down. ��She made it distinctively clear by dropping off no fewer than seven checks, starting from the time we were still chewing our dinner. ��She got increasingly annoyed when we continued to order drinks, and once we settled the bill followed us outside to show her outrage at her tip. ��Ironically, half of us didn't feel she deserved much of a tip, at all, we still put in more than we should. ��When she realized that she miscounted, and in fact was tipped well, she said oh and went back inside. ��Nice. ��Please avoid this place and give your patronage to one of"
Receptionist was super rude trying to turn away customers for Rick Bayless. ��Feel sorry for the restaurant. ��Bad first impression.
"This is one of my favorite places in Chinatown. The food and service are above average for sure, and they recently got some new, more modern decor! I always order the Fish fillet with chili bean sauce, and Mongolian Beef, which is always a good combination with rice! But, when I ate there recently, I noticed that the food did not taste the same as the last time and it was missing a certain zing. Perhaps it's just of their chefs cooking it, but I could still taste a difference. Comfortable place to just relax and look out the window (not much of a view) and chat with whoever you're with! Also, I just remembered, that I ordered a smoothie from there once but I wouldn't recommend it. I felt a few ice chunks and had a hard time sucking it through the straw because the smoothie wasn't smooth en"
"One of my all time favorite pizza places. Come with an appetite, all the pizzas are fantastic . The place gets crowded and it is usually a long wait for the seating and for ordering so if you go give yourself some time."
"This place is such a hidden gem! ?One of my ABSOLUTE favorites in the city!My first time here was about 6 months ago when a friend recommended it. ?After we trucked it to waaaaay out of my comfort zone (the place in on Ravenswood) and walked into the strip mall looking entrance, I was instantly thinking....oh great, this is going to suck. ?But that was so NOT the case. ?I was greeted by a super friendly guy who escorted my boyfriend and I to a cozy little 2 top table. ?We had heard it was BYOB so we were fully stocked on wine and someone rushed over and poured it for us right away. ?Then they bring the bread and dip...it's AMAZING! ?We looked at the menu ooh-ing and aah-ing for a few minutes unsure of what we wanted to order when the friendly guy came up to us again and asked if we had dec"
"Im in love. Cheap, and good eats! Awesome shakes..."
"The BEST deep dish pizza I've ever had, without a doubt. I know Giordano's gets labled as a tourist-y restraunt, but I am a Chicago native and no deep dish pizza will ever beat Giordano's for me (except maybe my mom's homemade deep dish). Nothing compares to walking blocks on a cold winter night and swooping in the revolving door with a blast of warm air and the delicious aroma of pizza. If you hate long waits, call in and order ahead of time or preorder and head to the bar. It takes nearly a half-hour to make your pizza if you're ordering a deep dish, never mind the long wait for a table. But it will all be worth it the minute you take that first cheesy bite. Every time I have visitors to the city, I always take them to Giordano's to have their lives changed, and they always leave happy."
"If you've got a few hours to kill and some cash in hand, one hell of a retreat to nestle up in for the night and pretend you're Hemingway."
after drinking here i will never be able to enjoy another cocktail as much. love love love love love love love love love love!!!!!
best restaurant in US. ��wine pairings not very good. �� only had 12 course instead of the 24 course. ��2008-02-17
"I was forced by my girlfriend and friends to visit and dine again at this Brazilian wannabe steakhouse, I don't know why I listen to them, the service was the worst in Chicago AGAIN, servers didn't care about tables it could be because the gratuity was included ? I don't know. And an Asian American manager got the attitude to high pitch his voice to the host of my party (my boss !!!) .... Ew ZED"
"This place is like a Golden Corral for people with money. We had no idea what we were walking into when we went here. We had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, we were just hungry and wanted a nice meal without have to wait for a table. This place served that purpose. Service was great, cocktails were good, and the food was, surprisingly, phenomenal. I will say that it is all you can eat, so it is overwhelming. My advice would be to just get the salad bar. There is MORE than enough for a meal on the salad bar, and it would save you $40 (which is the price for the endless meat - the salad bar is an extra $20, I think). We were also amused by the acrobat in the wine storage area. Very neat addition during dinner hours."
"I enjoyed the Purple Pig. ��The hype may be a bit much, but well worth a visit indeed. ��The tourists are a little out of control at the Pig but try a late weeknight for the best results."
"Yes..so I went back (not on my dime mind you) and the experience was awful. The waiter was so annoying...He was always pushing stuff on us too, it was very uncomfortable, unlike the first time"
"Went here on a Saturday night ! Beautiful restaurant, great service, good ambiance. the kebabs (chicken, lamb and kourbedeh) were amazing. Portions were good too. Great place to go be it on a date or with the family. I wanted to give 5 stars but can not because they have a lack of sauces to serve with food. Authentic Persian Food always serves homemade yogurt with food, this was not the case here and no other sauces were there to add that kick in the flavor. Everything else was just great, Do try the Tea after your dinner. Bon Appetit"
"Oh, Crisp. ?You teasing temptress. ?If I had known the power you would wield over me, I don't know that I would have started my flirtation with you. ?A flirtation that has now become a torrid love affair. ?A fixation, if you will.My friend, Adam, turned me on to Crisp. ?I remember him saying that when they first opened, he went there every day for a month. ?My friends and I tend toward extremes, so I just sort of sloughed off his talk as sort of a throwaway remark. ?Months later, we ended up in Crisp. ?I followed his advice and ordered a Not So Common Crisp fried chicken sandwich. ?(I just had a Freudian slip of a typo that read: sandwiSH. ?That's beause i *wish* I could have one right now.)He raved about the chicken, but I wasn't really expecting that much. I mean, how much can you really"
"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Honestly, nothing beats it! It is very classy and very cheap, and you always leave here stuffed! The food is also really healthy and everything is made fresh and all natural. And it tastes amazing! Everyday they have fresh cut flowers on the table, soft music, and the waiter service is excellent, they're on top of their game here, and aim to please! Their lunch special is a huge deal. For around eight bucks you get a drink (unlimited), salad, soup, a huge entree, egg role, rice, and dessert! For dinner it is just as good of a deal at about 10 bucks, and you get more! Just be sure to get a reservation and BYOB. It is a very romantic place in the evening with lit candles and is very swanky. Might be okay to get just a little more than casual."
Very impressed. Food tested fresh and full of flavour. The service was very friendly. Atmosphere was very chilled out and the background music was very relaxing. All in all a pleasant surprise.Definitely worh a try.
"I was only in the city for a few days, but was told I had to go there and eat. ��I was really glad the lady told me that the single dinning was cafeteria style, so didn't have to wait there for over 45 mins for food to be prepared. ��Just came back with my ticket and ate the entire pizza!"
Some of the best bbq chicken I have ever had ! I went there on their opening weekend and have been back many times . They have stayed consistently delicious and anyone I have recommended it to has loved it.
Our wedding cake was super yummy! ��The only complaint I have is that they did not completely follow how I wanted it decorated...but no big deal. ��Flavor is muchmuch more important!
"Exceptional service. Phenomenal food. Overall wonderful experience. The ""toast and jam"" is my favorite dish. Definitely make a reservation, especially if you're going on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night. It's a great atmosphere and is good for going on a date but also going with a group of friends. I recommend Sunda to anyone and everyone."
"I think I just had the best meal of my life. It's Sunday night and I walked in pretty late. ��The host sat me on the patio and was super sweet. No one rushed me or said the kitchen was closing, even though it was 9pm. My server, Matt, guided me through the menu so I got exactly what I needed. ��He was very knowledgable and cute! ��Try the green bean salad and the burger! It's to die for. ��And the Brunch Menu looks Fab. I'll be back for sure."
This is one of the best places in the city to find amazing thin crust pizzas. ��We'll go back any time we're in wicker park neighborhood!
"We hit our favorite pizza place Sunday. This was after a very busy weekend, and we were just starving. We did our traditional Buffalo Chicken that we almost never pass on, and tried something new called Morumbi(spelled right I belive..don't know what it means).....This might be my new FAV pizza..lots of portobello mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, and a garlic pesto sauce..IT is just an AWESOME pizza...(othe stuff too) ��We did delivery, kicked back, watched a film, and stuffed ourselves with the best pizza in the hood..Great way to finish a great weekend"
"WowWowWow!!Where to start!! I have nothing but great things to say about Texas de Brazil, located just a hop skip and jump from State Street in beautiful downtown Chicago. ��This elegant restraurant is a meat lover's heaven. ��The experienced servers journey their ways throughout a maze of tables with their eyes open for your card. If you flip it to green be ready to be bombared with almost all thirteen of their different meats (try the Picancha!!!) and they will continue to come until you flip it to red. With the gochoes roaming the restraurant with thier sword like skewers it is an amazing experience. This family friendly restraurant is begging for your reservations and when you do I suggest requesting Antonio as your waiter (He was as good as they come.) If your looking for a quick and ef"
"I had a couple of drinks at the bar tonight. They had the tvs on but no volume. Since it was 11 years after 9/11 and there was several news programs on about it. I asked if they could turn on the captions.The bartender and manager said the owner doens't want the captions on. Wow, on another anniversary on 9/11 and another immigrant pushing us around. I was told they only put the captions on for special and gay event.s. As a disabled veteran and on 9/11 I have to ask myself what serving and what those brave souls gave on 9/11 what it is all for. It must be horrible to put the closed captions on, unless it's for gay and special events."
something is different....not as good as it usually is.
"My boyfriend and I came here one night to try something new. We waited a little bit to get seated, but we found seats at the bar in the mean time. The wine was good, the people at the bar were nice, and the people seating us came back and checked on us to make sure all was good.We had the tom ka gai soup (with the coconut broth) and it was great! We also had the firecracker roll and one of the tuna rolls that I can't remember the name. They were so good that we got the daily special roll as our ""dessert!"" I will definitely recommend this place to people and will come here again!!"
"Recently, we had catering from Simply It for a company party. Half of our attendees were vegetarian, the other half being ravenous meat-eaters. I called about a week in advance to work out everything with the owner to make sure that it worked out smoothly for both groups. Thankfully, it worked out splendidly!For a group of 30, we got 5 different appetizers: avocado wontons, chicken puff pastry, shrimp spring rolls, seafood egg rolls, and the chicken avocado. Within the first hour of mingling and eating, all of the appetizers were gone. With the help of a couple employees from Simply It, we were able to change out the appetizers quickly with the entrees. They were extremely helpful and made sure that I was left with as little to do as possible regarding all of the food.Our entrees included "
"Sapori is simply one of the best Italian restaurants in Chicago. The interior atmosphere is excellent, although if you're planning to hang out in the bar for a while before your table is ready, there isn't a bar seating area. In the summer go for the outdoor seating, and remember the restaurant is much larger than the front makes it appear, with a large back room. The service has always been attentive, with good recommendations without being overbearing. Recommendations: Lobster Ravioli, Wild Mushroom Risotto, Shrimp and Broccoli pasta. After several visits, we have yet to come across an appetizer, dish or dessert to avoid. Chef Anthony consistently delivers."
"I remember living across the street from Sultans Market when it was a mini mart over 10 years ago..... oh the changes that have happened.I love that his Mother's food is still being served but on a grander scale, the baklava is to die for. ��I will be chowing down there every week, oh thank you Sultans Market!"
"Great granola and great sandwiches. I particularly like the one with avocado, tomato, smoked gouda on multi grain bread. ��They also have amazing fresh brewed ice tea. It's the perfect place to have lunch with the girls on a sunny spring day. I also reccomend the soup and desserts."
"Well then - they should rename this place Piece of CrapI went there last night for the live band karokee. You pick a song from a playlist and the band plays it, you sing. Sounds fun.The band showed up late and after they got going it seemed like they were taking a long time to play my song. I went to check the list and to my disdain found that they had crossed out my song as well as few others that I knew they didn't play. Is not the the point that they play what people want and we sing? Its not like I picked some random songs - these were from their playlist. Very disappointing.In addition we got a seat in the back of the the bar and were singing along to other songs. This isn't a quite lounge to whisper amont your friends, but a loud bar to yell and make new friends. Despite that, I was "
Dined there this past Friday night. Service was arrogant and unwelcoming. The food was good but the servings were so small we had to go to the sushi restaurant in our hotel after dinner. The wine and food were also over priced. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
"I have only been to this place once and at the recommendation of a friend, I had their soup #39 (if you go for it gotta go big!). ��I am not too familiar with this type of food, but I really enjoyed it! ��I liked that they let you season the soup with basil among other things, and that it seemed very hardy. ��For the price I think it was worth it."
One of the best korean places in Chicagoland. Served with many appetizers (best way to go). I ordered the cook at your table bulgogi and kalbi. I've never left unsatisfied.
This place is great. Although it is a bit pricey it is a nice date spot especially since they have live music there. Its okay to treat yourself every once in a while. I don't eat steak so I usually get the scallops which is excellent. Love the asparagas and the butter cake is to die for. Try it!
"Amazing, worth every penny! Definite destination for a special event."
"Well, I decided to write a review since I've been noticing that most of the servers here at: ""1132 N. Ashland Ave. Chicago, il 60622"" are not the same as it was before. My bf and I always go here for late night snack and most of the servers that we had were very friendly and accomodating. However, I ordered for pick up and when I had to get my order the cashier/server had some attitude. Man if you are dealing with a customer please don't show that you're getting irritated. You are there to show a friendly service and not to give attitude with your customers. Very disappointing. Hope the manager is reading some of these comments here on yelp......."
OMG soooooooo good. We ordered the Chef choice w/wine pairing. I have meat allergies and the chef was absolutely accomodating. He prepared me side selectios of seafood and veggies that were fabulous!Highly recommend!
"Excellent restaurant! ��We have been to Tru for dinner and for dessert. ��It is a great place to go for dinner, but I loved the dessert tasting. ��Who wouldn't want to enjoy course after course of dessert? ��Such innovative desserts as well as grown-up versions of childhood favorites. ��(Such as a miniature root beer float made from their own root beer). ��Lovely!"
"Tried the restaurant for the first time Saturday night with my wife and daughter. ��Had a reservation and was seated immediately even though the place was packed at 6:30. ��Service was excellent, food was delicous and portions were very generous. ��Definitely a fan and will return often."
Best salad bar in the city hands down! Parking sucks but they do have valet!
"I just ordered a medium, THIN crust pizza with green pepper and sausage toppings and I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM LA VILLA RESTAURANT AGAIN!I'll admit that I've ordered pizza from here before. It was decent, not great but I decided to give them another shot. I have no clue what happened this time. The dough wasn't cooked all the way through and was way too thick for a THIN crust. I ate a piece and called the restaurant right afterward. All they could say is ""sorry."" I can't even think about taking another bite. What a waste of money. For the first time in my life (20 of which have been in Chicago), I had to throw out a whole pizza. TAKE MY EXPERIENCE AS A WARNING. DO NOT ORDER FROM LA VILLA. There are too many pizza joints in the city to waste your money on them."
"The food is amazing. I've been to Sunda several times now, always trying something new. Definitely recommend the Rock Shrimp appetizer and any of their sushi. The last time we were there, we sat at the sushi bar. It was great to watch the artistry that goes into the rolls and the sushi chef even sent over a couple pieces for us to try! The Chilean Sea Bass is a 'can't miss' as well. Great service, too!"
"Delicious food, �� I am definetly going back, just a little tiny attitude from the waitress but it's ok...Tried chicken pad thai, was sooo good, and also tried a salad with beef and cucumbers in it, next time going with my husband and a bottle of wine..."
"If you love nostalgia, this is the place to be. My gang and I go on a Thursday night when we can arrange our schedules. We love Alan G's orchestra, the radio spots and the patrons who come dressed for the era. Maybe I'll invest in some vintage clothing when I get nerve enough to dance. Then, when someone compliments my dress I can really mean it when I say, Oh, this old thing? We are going back in a few weeks. I can't wait!"
"I live just a few blocks away from Nana, and before they opened I alway curious what will they do there -- and now I love the fact that I live close to them ! Last Friday me and my friends ( who came from another state to visit me ) had a not so nice brunch from Nightwood, I decided to treat my friend to a better breakfast place, and it was NANA .I really like their decor, their dining room arranged to be sch a nice homely environment , with big windows and lot of sunlights ,it gives you a morning boost right the way . I had learn from my past experience from NANA that their potions are ��somewhat too big for me , so I ordered only the side dishes -- Smash Squash -- YUMMY !! IT's so refreshing , with a hint of pumpkin and spices ! Side Salad -- I love the dressing ��, and the greens are exce"
"I wanted to go to a Mexican Restaurant, but instead we came here. ��It was very good."
"Whether it be the smiling faces that great you the moment you walk in the door, ��the delicious and flavorful dishes like the claypot chicken or the beef pho, or the bounty of complimentary fruit (Yes, that means FREE!) ��that comes with each take-out order, there are many reasons to try and then frequent Simply It. Since it first opened I have been consistently impressed with the food and service that I have experienced here, whether from dining in or carrying out, or for lunch or dinner. ��Dishes are very reasonable in price, but they don't skimp on fresh ingredients or quality. ��The owner is the nicest man on the planet and if I didn't have a father, I think I would want him to be mine. ��In a city where the choices for dining out are endless, know that eating at Simply It will never be a c"
"So I have been going to Wilde for brunch for months now and finally got a chance to write a review. ��Truth is I took some friends there for the first time and one of them said they were going to yelp about it and I didn't want to be showed up.The restaurant itself is great looking, it is so cozy and comfortable, especially the library. ��I always ask if there is a table available in the library, sometimes you get lucky!The staff is always attentive and efficient and most of the time they are super friendly.and the food...I love the pancakes here! They are my favorite item on the menu. ��They are lighty and kinda fluffy, but they have this amazing eggy taste to them that makes them really unique and delicious. ��No matter what else I order I always get a short stack on the side.I have never or"
"If you like meat and want a great experience, this is your place. There are more than 10 cuts of meat and a salad bar out of this world. fresh mozzerella, ham. beef steak tomato's, smoked salmon, and more. Besides the good food the the dinning room and the service is top notch."
"very classy, great food, fast service."
"Could this be the best, valued restaurant in Chicago? ?Well, if ?BBQ is a cuisine of choice, it just might be. ?That's a heck of a statement given the reputation and the current perception of the restaurant scene in our city, but let me point out some observations and realities that just might persuade your consideration.High quality organic meats. ?Detail in preparation. ?Savory tastes from top to bottom of menu. ?Exceptional wine pairing list (Zin + BBQ = Fun) ?Friendly/knowledgeable staff. ?Great ambience. ?Deference to the competition. ?GREAT value. ?Lee Ann Whippen.You're probably like, it's only a BBQ place, dude. ?Chill out!Well, you'll have to check it out. ?

"Being French and living in vietnam the food at le colonial has nothing to do with both, do not expect to eat french or vietnamese there. The atmosphere, the decoration, the service make you feel confortable unfortunately we lost the cigar area."
"Great food . We had the serrano ham and a seafood entree.Drinks are great, but a little expensive . Good Service."
"While visiting in Chicago last weekend we came across Big Jones in Andersonville. ��I had heard they had really good breakfasts. ��They did!! I LOVED the bloody marys, so spicy with horseradish and a slice of pickle. ��I wish could remember the exact names of each dish, but I can't. ��I ordered an eggs benedict with blue crab, delightful! ��My husband had the usual eggs benedict. ��He enjoyed his dish also. ��My son ordered corn cakes which I tasted, very good. He is a bit of a picky eater and he enjoyed it also. He especially enjoyed the cheesy grits. ��It was very busy and a bit noisy, but we didn't wait for a table. ��The servers were also very pleasant. ��I will be back when on our next visit!!!"
"LOVE this place, and I'm no pork lover--I'm a vegetarian. ��The vegetable dishes are fabulous and certainly no afterthought as they are at many restaurants that focus on meat. ��Wonderful selection to choose from, especially loved the salted beets and whipped feta smear. ��Bread is great, waiter kindly brought more when we ran out. My husband loved the tuna, I ate the spinach that came on the side which was very very good.For dessert we had the nutella sandwich, perfect ending to great dinner. ��We will definitely be back sooner rather then later."
"Been here a lot of times, food is always good to very good. I like the buffet options. Gets busy but they are super fast."
"Every time I come back to Chicago I have to eat here at least once. ��This place is better than Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, or Uno's! ��Art of Pizza wins hands down in both the pan pizza and deep dish pizza categories. ��The crust is buttery and crispy and the sauce has a slight sweetness. ��Plus I like the complete informal/casual atmosphere: Pick up your pizza at the counter and then sit down wherever you want. ��The guys behind the counter are friendly and easy-going."
"Service was acceptable for a high end place, though to be honest I find it awkward when people try to push in my chair or replace my napkin anyway.The decor is nice, especially the entrance. When you step into Alinea, the hallway shrinks towards the far end producing a very Alice in Wonderland type effect. Appropriate considering the highly creative dishes that are served.If you really love food, have the money to spend, and want something adventurous, I highly recommend Alinea. Otherwise, don't go. Many of the dishes are definitely hit or miss, and it's not fun to spend a chunk of change on twenty small courses, only a third of which you like. That said, I had a good time. I had the touring menu. Although I don't think this always happens, Chef Achatz came out to my table and painted the "
I'm not going to bore anyone with yet another review of this place. ��I think its pretty much established that it ROCKS. ��Three words: duck fat fries.
"I went here w/ the BF for Vday Brunch. The food was so tasty. I ate at least 10 oysters, not mention 5 mimosas. Highlights: mini crab cakes, lobster bisque, banana foster French toast, oysters, cold shrimp, white peach mimosa. The service was great John David was our server and I will request to be seated in his section next time. Old school tradtional type of buffet brunch, hipsters need not apply."
AsianNachos!! GoodGood vibe
This place is amazing!!! The service is amazing. The servers are very friendly and the setting is so inviting. Its a great place for a date. Full drink selection great choice for dinner and very relaxing. Its a nice place to set down and have a few drinks with dinner before a night out on the town. I will for sure return and ask for Mike to serve me!
"Good place to go. I have been here couple of times . Excellent atmosphere, Great Italian menu great food good portions and tasty, Fair drink prices, fantastic service."
"The first vegetarian restaurant I can actually say that I love.I've been to several vegetarian restaurants back in Colorado, and I've always felt that a lot of vegetarian food winds up lacking flavor when placed in the wrong hands. Not so with this place!I had the sweet potato quesadillas, and they were amazing. I sampled some bites from my friend's dishes as well...meatloaf, country fried steak...both delicious as well.From a former skeptic, trust me and give the Chicago Diner a chance."
"I am not sure what all the hype is about. I've been here plenty over the years (most recently because my fiance insits that we go). The food is good. But, you can go to other guero friendly places in the city that are cleaner, have bar service, and is overall much funner to be at. My test for restaurants is how clean their bathrooms are. The times I've ventured in--they are generally not clean and over-crowded. (stay away from the back room of the room where the bathrooms are-why? it smells like bathroom! Overall, good food but overrated. There are nicer places out there!"
"There are MUCH better places for brunch in Wicker Park. ��Fine, but overrated.I don't understand what they're trying to do, exactly. ��There's no table service, but you have to be seated by the hostess--THEN (and only then) you can go to the counter to order. ��The food came without silverware (we tracked some down in a basket over the fireplace). ��No one came to offer us refills or ask how the food was until we were about to leave. ��Even though you have no wait-service, they still expect a tip. ��I left one--but I'm not even sure who it went to. ��Don't even *try* to order before you're seated--the cashier went bat-s**t crazy on someone ahead of us in line when they misunderstood the convoluted ordering system. ��It's hard to mess up breakfast food, really, and they do the requisite extravagant"
"I'm a regular of Tuan's who gets carry out from this place several times a week. Let me tell you, this is one of the best places in Lincoln Park. The manager Tuan always has me sat down comfortably while I'm waiting for my food, I always get some hot warm tea to sip on, or water when it's warm in the summer.I'm a huge fan of the Basil Jalapeno beef, shrimp springrolls and chicken fried rice. However, what made me write this review was that Tuan recently told me he was trying out a new item on the menu and sent it home with me. It was a new variant of his simply it sandwich, it had fish, mayonnaise, cilantro, carrots, radish, some peppers and delicious it was down to the very last bite! I'm not usually a big fan of fish but this was just absolutely amazing and I think I will order it with m"
"Was very lucky to be invited to Revolution's soft opening!! The interior looks great! Warm and welcoming with a touch of modern melding well with the traditional. Re-use of beer barrels is creative and cool in the decorating. I tried many things on the menu and they were all great. Without exception. So I'm impressed. The deconstructed beef stew is super-delish, the brick oven pizzas were authentic and tasty, the mussels with mint were to die-for, and the fish and chips were very solid, although the side of slaw with honey and jalepeno stole the show on that dish. And, oh yeah! the beer. Okay, so I'm a girl and found the piney Iron Fist Ale to be a bit too much, but the Eugene Porter, the Cross of Gold and the Workingman's Ale were all really tasty. Rumors have it that carbonation has been"
"If you crave thin crust pizza from Rome, then this place will provide you with a quick fix. ��That's about it. ��We got there about 45 minutes before closing on a weekday night and were seated inside, in the room just west of the entrance. ��The place was spacious, but they sat us in the corner, next to two other couples. ��After the couples finished their dinner and left, the staff started breaking down the outside patio seating and bringing it inside. ��The door was kept ajar, so the cool restaurant air left the room. ��The place got warm and the ceiling fan didn't help. ��I felt like I was being rushed. ��How can you eat and drink when staff members are moving tables and stacking chairs right in front of you? �� ��We ate our pizza and gulped down our wine. The dessert menu came. ��We decided to pa"
"I am disappointed with my fellow yelpers. Zed is a great place! It's new and it's theme isn't about stuffing yourself to the max, it's about trying new selections and making the ""menu"" work for you. The price is comparable to any other place in the area and what you can get is amazing. Items are always changing due to what is in season and what the chefs deem desirable. I have been there twice and left completely satisfied. The staff is pleasant and it seems like they are having a great time! Of course there will be kinks but come on! It's a new restaurant...let's give them a chance. The drinks are unique and the outdoor deck is wonderful. I had the opportunity to try some of the bar menu items and was blown away. For all of you out there that don't like the meat selections order off the b"
"First visit, we went spur of the moment for a late dinner. Would go back in a heartbeat, and will make a special trip to catch the luncheon buffet. The tasty bits-o-garlic naan with the creamy/spicy tomato dipping sauce are like appetizer crack. They gladly refilled both the basket of naan-lets and the bowl of yummy, no charge, no questions asked. When I wondered if it were possible to get a smaller order of a veggie entree to accompany my (what proved to be) heavenly chicken makhani, the waiter was quick to suggest a half order. Which we used to get aloo gobi (a personal fave.) It was quite tasty, and the potatoes were not cooked to mush. We also had the veggie samosas (potatoes and peas) which arrived with a 4-pack of condiments. Beware the salty balls...not sure what all was in there, b"
"My wife and I arrive at Shaws around 4:30 P.M. on Sunday 6/12/2011. She ordered a beer, bowl of clam chowder and a lobster roll. I ordered a beer, bowl of clam chowder and the fish and chips. The clam chowder was great. The problem arises as I watch an order of fish and chips along with her lobster roll with fries and coleslaw is placed under a heated area to keep it warm. At this time someone takes the fish and chips and delivers it to another table that had been shorted an order due to someones mistake. All the while my wife's lobster roll and coleslaw (which should be served cool) is setting under a heat lamp. Fifteen minutes later another order of fish and chips along with the lobster roll and coleslaw is delivered to our table. The 3 pieces of fish were about the size of my fingers an"
"A fun place but not a jaw dropping italian meal. The noise level is part of the ambiance. I always feel like I have been to a concert when I leave... a little ringing in the ears. The food is solid but very basic. The food is good but not sophisticated. You don't eat here and think, I couldn't cook this at home. Service is fast and friendly. The bus staff works like mad and everyone is friendly. To sum it up. It is a great place to go with a group of friends where table wide conversations are not important. You will all have a good time, but don't expect to catch up with anyone. It is fine for casual dining but I don't think I would call it a date place unless you are not interested in getting to know the guy you are with.That said, if you go late on a week day, it doesn't sound like a tra"
"I really loved this restaurant and wanted to give it 4 stars, but our experience just didn't reflect it in the end...We had reservations and were seated on time (which apparently, is rare). ��The mojito I sipped on while waiting was fabulous. ��The atmosphere was open and festive and I loved the music, though I do agree with one diner that they need to turn the lights down a notch or two. ��All in all, I thought we were headed for a perfect dining experience.The extensive wine list was impressive but our server's knowledge of what was on it was not. ��He made generic suggestions (albeit with flare) and then brought out each bottle of wine (15 minutes later) separately. ��Thankfully, I had not yet moved on to my second mojito so I realized that each bottle he brought was wrong.We tried the cevic"
"I heard about this place through a bartender at another restaurant in my neighborhood. ��He recommended the Tuesday night special of fried chicken, but I couldn't wait that long and chose to visit Big Jones on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. ��I made reservations because I figured the place would be busy, and I'm glad I did. ��We were seated immediately. ��At first I was a little skeptical since I had a reservation but was seated right next to the kitchen, however, this turned out to be a blessing indisguise. ��Since I was right next to the kitchen I was able to watch all of the delicious food come out and even discovered that they had fried okra, an item that wasn't listed on the menu! And since I LOVE fried okra I immediately placed an order for an appetizer! ��At $4 you can't go wrong. ��It was"
"Best Restaurant in the city, best service, fantastic meats Thank You so much Stefan @ HDInstalls"
"I tried this place twice over the last three weeks. The first time, I really liked it. Our waitress was really sweet and crepes were flavorful. So, on our second visit there, we took a friend with us--wasn't impressed at all. The place was crowded and the seats were badly arranged-while the booths that sit 4 were all occupied by couples, they made us squeeze on a two top, which wasn't enjoyable. After a long wait, we got our food--though the ingredients were definitely flavorful, my crepe was cold, and the soup bowl that came with it was 1/3 empty! I also didn't like the fact that they charged $1.00 extra for the bread, and $1.50 for the olive oil to dip. Keeping the prices of the menu items reasonably affordable and then charging for those small things that should be complimentary is just"
Wildfire is one of my favorite restaurants hands down. ��Their salmon is so flavorful and well cooked. ��Their scallops and sauteed spinach dish is one of my favorite dishes...those scallops are *kisses fingers* magnificent. ��The steaks are wonderful and the surf and turf is excellent. ��Oh yes. ��I will be coming back....definitely.
food was great and best of all its so close to me. One thing i didnt like is that it closes in between hours.
"I went there on a Friday at 2 pm and it was packed. Waited an hour and twenty minutes.  �� It was worth every second. You get in there, and one side of the wall is the menu and all the specials, and the other side is pictures of sausage and hot dogs. And when after all the time spent in line, Doug is there to take your order. I ordered a large drink, and he politely told me that there is free refills on the small drink. I got the Alligator Sausage (which I split), The Apple and Cherry Pork Sausage w/ dried fruit, some manchego-esque cheese, and sweet curry mustard, with an order of duck fat fries. My friends got the corn dog, bratwurst, hot dog, and regular fries. ��Everything was off the charts good. I would never imagine mixing shrimp sauce with a smoked alligator sausage. But the stand-ou"
"1st time at Zed451 and the great experience began as we walked through the entrance to a fabulous ambiance and welcoming host. ��We were seated immediately upon arrival and provided with an informative explanation of the seasonal signature dishes and harvest table selections.The harvest tables had a wide variety of items that included an amazing seared ahi tuna dish. ��The selection of cheeses was also more than satisfactory.After enjoying the harvest tables, the Zed451 experience got even better as the assortment of signature dishes were brought to our table by the chef. ��Among the most succulent dishes were the Buttermilk Sirloin, Amaretto & Pistachio Duck Breast and Fire Grilled Ribeye. ��(Wow, my mouth is salivating thinking about it as I write this!) ��The service was superb and friendly "
Chicago's best pizza! The carmelized crust is delicious! The sausage topping was delicious! WELL DONE!
"This place is a joke.Over priced, cheap cuts of meat, without any flavor. ��Served with bland potato and yucca, that was so unimaginative, it was simply over done in the oven. If you are looking for any sort of flavor in your steak, other than the salt licks they serve here, go elsewhere. ��If you enjoy cheap cuts of over priced meat, soaked in oil, make your reservation now.Sometimes I wonder how some places as bad as this, last so long in Chicago. ��Then I remember that most of you come into this place, see how the skirt steak is the house specialty on the menu, then the waiter reiterates this, and you sheep lap this up."
"I've been here three times, each with a yearning hope of greatness. I want to like it so bad, but I think I settled on giving up this last time around.I want to mention that other than the 15 minutes we waited for a server, the service has always been consistently great and accommodating, even when they are training someone. Always very knowledgeable and friendly :-)Though the burger was great, cooked nicely at Medium Rare, loved the pickled onions. Also a fan of the sweet potato fires with goat cheese fondue, but the fondue is hit or miss, salt-wise. Usually severely under seasoned.This has echos of a place I was a cook at back in the day where the chef had what seemed like an allergy to salt. The steak was average, no hint of horse radish in the condiment it is served with, the basic fri"
"I love this place. ��Great for romantic evenings or for just a fun meal. ��Great wines and the veggies and meat are always fresh and great quality. ��They also half half bottle of wine nights and if you sign up for their mailing lists on their webpage you get a buy one meal get one free for birthdays, anniversarys etc."
"Wow! That place is beautiful. The theme definitely keeps the attention of the costumers. The first time i went to Carnivale, the food was great, and it came out pretty quickly, considering how many tables were seated. However, during my second visit, ��the service, i believe was horrible. Lets just say my waiter didn't do his job well. My food came out cold. I don't know maybe he was just late serving it. In addition, my friends and I never received bread and when we asked he rudely told us they were out and left. ��He made us feel very unwelcome when we were ordering our dinner too. ��I hope this improves, if i go back again."
Way over-rated.It's so dark inside we had to use the table candles to read the menu. And the tables are packed so tightly together it's like flying coach. Not a chic crowd -- the beautiful people have moved on. Hostess was so snooty it needs to commented on -- but I will say the server was better. Food was mediocre -- not value for money. There are too many other restaurants in Chicago serving better food for the same dollar. I had the ginger marinated duck -- it was pedantic. ��My companion had the salmon vermicelli -- it was a $12 entree for $23. There are better options.
"WOW, What a wonderful time we had. Were do I start. The staff is AMAZING. The bartender made us a new drink we had never had before and she (Jenn) explained how she prepared the drinks. Very fresh and delish. She also suggested a nice bottle of wine for our meal that was outstanding. Now the food. We live in Missouri and raise cattle so we are very critical when it comes to beef and the preparation. Had the pot roast, the best you will ever taste in your life the flavors blended well I had the pasta w.homade panchetta, again the flavors were outstanding. GET the fries. Best dining experience I've had so far in Chicago. We will be back again and again"
"One of my favorite little restaurants in the city. ��Try the gnocchi or anything that says Piedmontese next to it (cream porcini mushroom sauce, YUM!). ��Can get packed on weekend nights. ��No corkage fee = good cheap dinner w/ friends!"
"Depends on the day and on the cook...I use to go to the old location before it moved. It was real rough lookin' then, but now it's larger and cleaner. However, some things never change... the service! It's a deal killer!!! Sorry folks. The waitresses were terribly slow to non-existence. I don't mind ��waiting usually; I'm patient gal. But, how long is too long?!! I tried to leave, but unfortunately, I was with two knuckle heads (my brother and mother). Or else, it's see-ya!!!So, let's get to the grub review: The duck is always good. When in doubt, go for the duck. My brother ordered: lobster, fried rice, kai-lan (chinese broccoli), beef with black beans, and half order of roasted duck. SHOCKED... and mumbling @ssHOLE 'cause I had to pay, AGAIN. I just ordered some soup with wontons. We shar"
Amazing destination on Clark street. ��Wait staff is knowledgable and friendly and the food is pretty amazing. ��If you have a sweet tooth it is the place for brunch!If you have a taste for some southern flavor (specifically SC and LA) their locally sourced menu will amaze. ��(Gumbo...Yum!) ��I personally to make it there at least one a week.
"While out shopping Belmont this weekend me and my party decided it was time to grab some dinner. A person in our party for the evening suggested we try 90 Miles Cuban Caf�� for ""some of the best food Chicago had to offer"", so we gave it a shot. We called a few hours prior to the time we would arrive and tried to make a reservation, we were told they did not take reservations, when we arrived after trying to park for an hour we were asked if we had a reservation. We explained to the host that we were told they did not take reservations, she said whoever told you that was wrong, so we could either wait the 45 minutes or come back some other time. ��The person who suggested the place persuaded us to stay. My party chose to sit outside since it was a beautiful night but I decided to take a look "
"Poor Management. Will never return. Valet parked my car as it was snowing. When I left, gave the valet $12 and he handed me my key. Didn't back it up away from snow or clean my windshield. Manager refused to refund my money, just said sorry. Well, sorry, I will never return and will shoot down any recommendation of this place. If I did that at my job, I would be fired."
"Great Italian restaurant !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, Food was excellent , fresh, the server Nick was outstanding and the chef came out to greet us and check up on us( what a great guy ) Atmosphere was great and service was 5 star!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ask for NICK the server, he will walk you through the whole menu and recommend a great wine !!!!!!!!!!!!"
The breakfast is amazing every time. Coming here is part of our regular diet. :)
"Today I experienced an over the top culinary experience. ��I went to Graham Elliot for their Sodapalooza dinner! ��Can I say: ��Sheer Ecstasy! ��We started the meal with lobster that was paired with Ginger Ale. ��The soda was also integrated into the dish. ��It was delicious. ��The second course was halibut that was paired with an orange soda (again utilized in the sauce as well). ��Quite possibly one of the most delicious taste sensations of all times. ��A pork dish followed, paired with Root Beer, and then dessert which was a popcorn gelato, and house made sweets that recalled reeces and milk duds. ��Unreal! My new favorite restaurant in Chicago!!!!!"
This placew was pretty good. Im not a vegetarian but my friend is and I went because she always ends up sitting there eating bread everytime we go out with friends. So I really though I would puke up whatever I order and run screaming to the next steakhouse. Surprisingly the food was really good. I was not expecting the taste to be so well seasoned and flavorful. Way to prove me wrongKudos!
"It's all good. But $4 for the almonds fried in pig fat, with rosemary and garlic? Divine."
"I know places are difficult on a Friday night...but this place goes out of it's to make you feel uncomfortable. Bashed by wait staff as they scramble to get food to tables and 10 minute wait at the bar to get served whilst we waited for a table. So pint in hand of their own brewed beer my husband and I eagerly took are first sips. The beer was very lively one might say, having lived in the UK and traveled to many fine pubs...this was unusual and I thought fairly difficult to drink. A fizzy ale is a strange sensation. We waited about 30 minutes and finally got seated at our table and then waited another 15 minutes for a waiter to appear. He was nice but highly stressed as he manned a small poky corner of the restaurant. The appetizer arrived a spinach dip with very little spinach..it was OK"
"I love this place!1. The pizza is amazing. As a die-hard Chicago-style fan, its hard to admit, but Fogo's tasty flat wins out over my deep dish cravings more often than not. The veg ingredients are the freshest I've seen, and the meats and cheeses are of such high quality and in such large portions that you really notice the difference.2. The service is amazing. Brad, the owner, is the friendliest guy ever, and everyone there makes an effort to know my name and what kind of pizza I like. They're fast, too. �� 3. The place is clean. I'm a food-industry person, and I can honestly say Fogo is among the cleanest places I've ever seen. Only issue: when they're busy, the ""no-touch"" (read: sanitary) trash bins get really full - and I feel bad leaving my trash on the counter! I recommended you shov"
"Awesome hot dogs! ��Friendly staff all around. ��A little bit of a wait depending on when you go, but its worth it!"
"I went here after hearing wonderful reviews, ��but walked away with saucy leftovers I ��never ��ate again. I was excited to try this place because of my friends raving about it. I went with some of these friends and my boyfriend around 8:30PM. The pizza smelled good, but ��it did not ��taste very well or look appetizing. The pizza dough was more bread-like, which is OK in my book, but the sauce looked like tomato soup on top of bread. ��It even sloshed around when the waitress placed it on the table. And where was the cheese? I don't know. ��My boyfriend and I both were trying to find it under the soupy sauce. ��The sauce reminded me of watery tomatoes with extra seasoning to compensate for the lack of cheese and thickness of the sauce. One of my coworkers, who had gone before and enjoyed the pizz"
"Zed was a great experience. I went with a group of friends and it was perfect. I love their funky decor which is modern yet provides a chic-lodge feel. On top of the great rooftop bar, their food is delicious and is great for groups since there is a large selection even for vegetarians.Definitely a great and fun place to go with friends whether for a cocktail or an entire meal--you won't be disappointed!"
"New to Vietnamese cuisine - now a lover. Fresh ingredients and bountiful. I couldn't stop eating ��- it was so good - and the courses kept on coming!What a deal for lunch! For $6.95 I had a salad, soup, eggroll, big plate of beef pasta, a plate of fruit, and a large fresh squeezed lemonade. Yum!Definately will return~!"
"The best sushi in Chicago, period. You can try to beat it, and I hesitate to ��say ""for the price"" because it seems to convey there are better if you pay a lot more, but I don't think there are. First, a sushi restaurant should be busy to be good, fish spoils, it makes sense. Wakamono always has good traffic and thew sushi is always superb. The take out and dine in are both great. This restaurant and ping pong across the street (same owner) are awesome!"
This is a good place to take a date for a romantic evening. The pasta is awesome. I had New York Strip steak there and it was great. It was moist and cooked to my liking. Their food is well prepared no matter what you order. The wait staff are super friendly and on top of things. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!
"first time having the Chicago style pizza...what was i waiting for??there was a bit of a wait to get it, expected that...but it went fast...atmosphere was cool, watching the guys spinning the dough...prices were very reasonable...appetizer plate was very good, the pizza was so filling we couldn't finish it...our family of 4 are pretty good eaters and it was more than enough, and exactly half the price of our meal the day before at the Cheesecake Factory"
This place is a huge disappointment! ��The costumer service at this place does not exist. Period. One would put up with this if the food was great but it is really below average. I will not be coming back as I went with a few business associates and it was embarrassing. Unfortunately.
"I thought this place was horrible... the managers / owners totally suck. They thought it was more of their own personal playground then a business that needed to be ran. Instead of having managers on the floor working they are touching all the girls that come in. I actually saw the managers grab a beer from the bar when on the job, then start ��trying take care of customers. Then we had a server that never smiled I think her name was Sarah... very unhappy person. She made 2 of my friends feel very uncomfortable that they actually wanted to leave earlier than we had planned. I've been working in restaurants my whole life and never saw such unbelievable things happen in a restaurant before."
"Finally revisited this restaurant after a number of years and was glad to see that it's going strong. It's definitely a youngish, hipster crowd with a very laid back vibe. The food was good overall, but I have to say the potato skins were a significant disappointment. I guess certain things just don't quite translate to vegan. They could stand to add a few original menu items, rather than relying almost exclusively on meatless approximations of traditional dishes. That said, it's probably worth a return visit at some point to explore other parts of the menu."
"best experience in Chicago out of 5 places in a 24 hour period, mostly for the ambiance. the dog is really quite average, but it a fun joint and the toppings are different, so it would be cool to try it out. DONT expect a culinary accomplishment, though, it is just a good dog with new toppings. So much for the tv shows."
"Pizza is simply amazing! TWO THUMBS UP!!! It's all the sauce, so gooooood!"
"Makes me feel like home.Peking duck was MAGNIFICENT. This is as close to China as you can get in Chicago. There's side table service where they slice the skin for you. THe duck soup and fried rice that comes w/ it is marvelous, just nice. We also ordered steamed fish, pork ribs peking style. There were 5 of us and it was only $16.50 each person for all those feast!Cheap, reliable. If you dun mind the place looking a bit asian standard (not much decorations). It's awesome"
"Great food! Try the vegetarian and meat combo (2 of each) to get a sampling ��of many things. The service was good, the food delicious, and prices reasonable."
"Wow!!! ��I can't get enough of this place!! ��I'm there at least twice a month and it hits the spot everytime I go!!! ��I was there this past Saturday and I'm craving for more!!! ��Lamb Chops are my Fave!!! ��I know that there are other places that are similar to Fogo, but none of them compare to Fogo!!!!"
Love this place!!
"As with the other Brazilian steakhouses in the city, this one has tons of fire roased meat, seared to perfection. What does this have that the others don't? Amazing service. We went there for the first time on VDay and were absolutely blown away by the level of service. The server called us by name, made suggestions (like, Try the sushi bar!) and took great care to make sure we were satisfied. Not only the server, but all the gauchos as well. The decor is dark and homey, a very large space broken up into many smaller dining areas, so you're not overwhelmed by noise even when it's crowded. This was the best experience we've had, after visiting the other places many times, we will now only return to Texas de Brazil."
Great Chicago Style. And one of the only places I know of where you can get Chicago Style by the slice. That is awesome. ��Check this spot out for sure if you haven't tried it yet.
"Food was just OK. The restaurant has an oil smell, and the food doesn't justify the price. We had better fondue on the Melting Pot. Stay away from this trap.In addition to at most an average experience on the food, the most unacceptable and disappointing thing happened to us. At arrival we used valet parking. My husband left his sunglasses in the car. When we arrived back home he noticed his sunglasses disappeared. We called the restaurant right after getting home and their response was that their employees are honest and would never do that. Well, they did and probably will do it again. Don't be the next victim and don't support business that don't respect their customers."
"Really great. We went here for our anniversary. The service was outstanding. We had the five course tasting menu with the wine paring. We were going to go for the 10 but one of us is allergic to wheat so the waiter checked with the kitchen but unfortunately it could not be adapted to wheat free. That's ok though because the 5 course turned out to be perfect. They even specially printed a menu of what we had to eat, for our anniversary. Lastly the cocktails were superb. Would definitely go back!"
India House is one of the better Indian restaurants downtown. ��It's got a great lunch buffet and is a nicely decorated restaurant for its River North location.
"I grew up on this stuff. So, the can really do no wrong. They make a great pizza."
"This place is just gorgeous! The decor details were absolutely classy and really reminded me of the scenes in The Quiet American: ceiling fans, banana trees, antique oil lamps, etc. We sat at a table on the balcony upstairs and enjoyed watching the busy street and elegant people socializing below. The food was excellent. I wanted to have all of their appetizers as I hadn't had them for a while but we only got Betel Leaf wrapped beef and lotus root salad. The Vietnamese-styled beef steak I had tasted like homemade. Overall, excellent food, great service, and unique atmosphere. I'll come back for more to cure my craving for mom's food!"
yukkie garbage!
"I visit my sister every Thanksgiving from San Francisco ?and was so delighted by our first experience at ?XOCO ?last week., we decided to take the kids after the circus this week - Day and Night. ?The hostess was quite rude. ? XOCO is very popular but we decided that it would be a perfect treat after our annual Barnum and Bailey circus show. ?We patiently asked for a table and were willing to wait 35+ minutes, because of the superb torta, churros, chocolate experience the week before. ?We lived in La Jolla and Del Mar for several years and our palates were ready.First the hostess demanded to split our group of four in two separate counter areas, we asked to wait for table service - but she kept insisting that we split up? ?We pleasantly suggested that we were there to enjoy as a family. ?S"
"I almost slipped and fell twice!! The floor is so greasy, an accident waiting to happen. ��My dad told me it's because they cook their food with lard, and the waitresses bring out the grease from the kitchen on their shoes. ��After that I was utterly disgusted, if that's the dining area what must the kitchen be like? I wish I would have known this before hand."
"Went into Milk and Honey last Sunday with friends and it was PACKED. ��Now, the space isn't exactly the biggest, but every table was taken nonetheless. ��That's always a good sign.Onto the food -- my friend and I split the Bagel with lox and cream cheese and it was really great. ��The cream cheese looked like it was homemade with chives and came with red onions, tomatoes, cucumbers and capers -- all of my favorite things! ��My friend got the huevos rancheros and we both really thought it left A LOT to be desired. ��It generally lacked seasoning and flavor which was shocking from such a would-be flavorful dish!We would definitely return for coffee and the bagel and lox but, although the waitstaff was friendly, we felt service could be improved."
"Breakfast is my favorite meal to go out for, and this was great. I have been there a few times and have had a great experience every time.They have so much to choose from it was hard to decide what to get. We did allot of sharing at our table. Every thing I have had there I would have again."
What a great place. Seafood done well. Great service! Neat decor. One of my favorite places!
"We were group of 5... non of us had nice food and will not go back. Food was just ok - like I made it myself at my place for the very first time.... bland.... not sometnihg Italian places are famous for. Believe me I have had way better lasagna or pasta than food they serve!!!Im giving one star for nice looking restaurant, ambience and decor... but thats not the reason for me to go back!"
"Fantastic! ��Meals were affordable, service was great, atmosphere was phenomenal. ��It was a quaint restaurant with high quality food. ��Highly recommended. ��We went here on New Years Day and it was open! Hours are consistent and convenient."
"I love that the restaurant offers tiny sample sized dessert offerings (made in-house) like raspberry pie, Key lime pie, chocolate layer cake and cr��me brul��e, so you can have your five desserts, and eat them too. Especially after stuffing yourself with crab legs or the delicious crab sandwiches!!"
"Been here twice. ��and I shouldn't have because the second time was just like the first. ��Not good in any way. ��I guess the service was not so bad, but it could have been a little better knowing that there were not many diners at the restaurant. ��The food was nothing special. ��I don't remember what appetizers, maybe because it wasn't good. ��I had the braised short ribs and they were not moist and if they pretended to be, it was only because of the salty over reduced sauce they glazed on top. ��The vegetables that were served were the only thing i guess worth eating.The second time was the same, if not worse. ��I can't even remember what I tried that time around, except for a coffee. ��This place is lucky it's on Mich Ave for business."
"I only eat at the small red building on the east side of the street. Was coming since 1982. I used to passsionaleyly recommend this ��resaurant to everone I could tell.but not now. People who are giving good reviews must not have been able to compare the burritos and tacos to the earlier years. I've been there 6 times in the last two years and the quality of the meat is a shadow of what it was. Previously the steak used in the burritos and tacos was jucy and alway a bit chewy. It was the best. Now I don't find any of that, I could hardly chew the meat on the last 6 visits and not juicy at all. I can't be the only reviewer who feels this way. The food quality has definetly cheapened which is why I won't revisit or recommend."
Made reservations for 8:30 pm but had to wait til past 9:00 pm for a table. The wine list was extensive and the waiter helped make a selection. It was just ok. Had the antipasti (sp?) appetizer shared at the table. Some items were ok but overall nothing great. My pasta dish was very good. Black linguine noodles with seafood (mostly calamari) in a tomato broth/sauce. I'd order it again.
"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday, from the moment we walked in we were treated like family. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. ��I had the vegetarian goulash ��(sp?) which was awesome, my boyfriend had the skirt steak which was equally as good. ��The service and entertainment a guitarist and violinist were great, very friendly and fun. Although the food and staff were all excellent there was one thing that stood above the rest, the owner Bronco, he made our night something we will never forget. ��You're the best Bronco and we WILL be back. P.S. watch out for the holy water."
"I know the place has a huge beer selection, but to be honest, it was a bit of a let-down. ��I thought it had too many Belgians and not enough of other types for my taste.As far as the other customers, they were friendly and polite when we were trying to work our way through the place (it was quite crowded). ��It was not particularly easy to get to the bar, due to the crowd. ��I'd suggest checking out the upstairs to see if there's more room up there. ��As for the bartenders, they seemed a bit pretentious and aloof to me. ��I had the unfortunate experience of dealing with a short guy that had a striking resemblance to The Fonz, and he was quite rude. ��Almost as if I was annoying him by asking for a couple beers.Good for groups? ��Only if you can snag a table. ��My friend and I had a hard time find"
"Do you love paying for pretension and bland food? well have I got a place for you! After hearing rave reviews and how friendly the staff and wonderful the food was I was underwhelmed. ��Admittedly we sat at the bar and ordered a bottle of wine with a couple of first courses, however, considering the place wasn't full and they were fully staffed AND it was the night before Christmas Eve - well what can I say- the staff seemed bored the former reality ��star chef refused to come out of the kitchen - apparently he was extremely busy to step out for 2 mins - but whatever...the food was bland and unmemorable - how on earth can you do that to Foie Gras? Well Chicago you're my home town but this sad attempt at being NYC is not working - Greek Town, Little Italy I will never forsake you again. ��Spro"
"Yo I'ma write dis review in hopes that I get it printed on a napkin or somethingErryone's mustaches is too big and dey whiskey needs to be poured by a hottie wita body lyke at soundbar am i rite. WHO EATS PIG FACE WTFLIGHT'S OUT - long live skittles 4everit's the best restaurant in chicago get off yelp and go. and shut up about the wait, that's what people do for good things."
"I am Korean, and love our way to cook meats with charcoal and table grills, went there with my Korean frd, we both agreed the meat is so tender, the BBQ sauce was great, the marinated Kalbi served with little side dishes & veggies( think more than 10 different kinds) is most recommended, service is not as good as the food, but always nice to ask refill the little dishes as much as you want, that's the best thing in Korean culture, too! but don't forget good tips...the Korean little-old ladies ��were little scary...."
Best Brazilian steak house in Chicago !!!Liked it better than Fogo De Chao and Texas de Brazil
I love hot dougs. ��I love hot dougs. ��I love hot dougs. ��I love hot dougs. ��I love hot dougs. ��There are my five stars in five short sentences. ��This place is brilliant!
"Me and my girlfriend went to this place for the first time today. The shakes are amazing and so is the food, however the 4 star rating comes in the fact that it costs a small fortune to eat at this place. The hot dog's from what I know are custom made solely for this location, which is definetly cool. I would go back again, this time prepare to spend 5.50 for a hot dog and friends."
"I discovered this place on a whim. There was a man handing out menus outside. Some of the best Vietnamese restaurants I have tried were in Washington Dc. My favorite is 2 soups, Pho and a tamarind soup. The Pho was good but it came with red onions that were raw. I get bad heartburn from raw onions. the tamarind soup was good but needed a ittle hot sauce. This made it better but was more broth than anything else. Not as good as Dc but worth a second visit."
"Garcia's is great -- best Mexican rest. on the North side, I think. ��It's particularly good for the price you pay. ��The margaritas are a bit on the weak side, but whose aren't? ��The steak burrito has been great for decades, and the tacos are worth the $2."
"Good place to get a beer and pizza. Their beer is really good, and its fun to sit and watch the game."
"Always fresh and delicious, this italian treat deserves special attention. ��In true neighborly form, ��owner Johnathan Goldsmith treats diners like welcome family. For example, while I was soliciting business support for a school fundraiser, Johnathan not only supplied a generous Gift Certificate for our event, he fed my ��2 kids a snack- each got a 1/2 a pizza to munch on. . . the aroma was too much to take, and we were back without the kids a day later to ��gorge on fresh, delicious mouth-watering italian pizza. . . ummm. . . think maybe we need to head back tonight:)"
I have made this my go too as its blocks from my house but I am never ever going here again and I suggest a boycot. Asked for 2 cups of cheese and they bring us 2 big bowls and charge 5 bucks a pop ( for dipping a few fries?) ...combine that with the super bad attitude of the woman manager and her waitress made me sick....this place sucks. �� The time before last they put me in a hi traffic area and after 20 min I had to ask to move cause it was the worst seat in the house.i tip very well and i refuse to give these horrable service a cent..I would rather have mcdonalds than deal with this horrable service...I highly highly recomend superosa over la villa any day of the week....your staff needs a major attitude adjustment and I will make sure to let everyone know it. Worst service I've ever 
"Wow, what a great place. ��The Hostess was polite. ��The waiter/waitresses were efficient and knowledgeable of the menu. ��My food was wonderful and the the dessert was scrumptious. �� ��Five stars for this place!"
"I don't know if I just went on a horrendous night or if some of the other reviewers have low standards, but my experience was awful. ��My wife and I went with another couple and had a reservation (12/2). ��Things didn't start off well with us being seated over 20 minutes late, but grabbed a drink and didn't let that bother us. ��Had I known that was going to be the highlight of the experience, we would have left for another establishment. ��Upon being seated, our served notified us that there were a few adjustments to the menu. ��No salmon, instead walleye. ��No wagyu, instead short rib. ��There were one or two more, but these adequately convey that the substitutions were for much cheaper and inferior products. ��The people walking around with the meat were also very scarce. ��Normally when dining "
"When an offer for Geja's came up on Groupon, I decided that it was finally time to try this Lincoln Park institution after ignoring it for the 7 years that I was a neighbor of Geja's. ��I took my husband there for his birthday last night and I was extremely pleased with not only the atmosphere but the service, wine list and above all the FOOD. ��The cozy, romantic interior was wonderful and different than many other Chicago eateries. ��We ordered the beef, shrimp and lobster dinner and for $49.95 I would say that it was a deal considering the multiple courses included. ��The cheese fondue was decadent, the meat high-quality and vegetables very fresh. ��The ending of the dark chocolate fondue with fresh fruit, pound cake and marshmallows was heavenly. ��I know this isn't the healthiest choice of "
always happy with this restaurant and taste of food. because so many variety side dishes and bbq meats are superb and waitress are really nice and helpful and glad that they going to open in morton grove soon.
"I have been going to Sultan's for years. The food is great and really affordable! However, I may be wrong but I feel like certain dishes have a bit less of a kick than they used to. I was slightly dissapointed by the soup and the tabouli salad when I had them last some months ago. Not enough spice I thought - it had been a couple years since I had tried them. However, everything else still rocks and the salad bar is a great deal! Everything ��on the bar is really fresh and delicious. You can fill a container with all sorts of goodies and pay very little for variety that would be expensive to make at home. Great food. Great prices."
"WOW! Best tacos in Chicago hands down. The serive isnt all that great but theyre def. people you can sit back and talk to and have a laugh with. This place is especially great after a hard night of partying or after a concert. I recommend the ""carne asada"" tacos with some Jarritos, I def, recommend this place."
"Do NOT go, unless you are prepared to stand around for two hours and then be told that it will be another twenty minutes. ��Not acceptable. ��I became particularly irritated by waiting around while open tables just sat and sat. �� ��The bar was packed, so it wasn't like you could enjoy a drink at the bar while you waited. ��VERY DISAPPOINTED..."
"This Garcia's location is closer to home, so we decided to give it a try. ��It quickly became part of the ""regular rotation"". ��We really enjoy the food and the drinks, as the margaritas are some of the strongest we've had.Typically get tacos (chorizo or al pastor) or tostadas. ��They have been great everytime. ��Also, in my opinion, the cadillac margaritas are worth it ... stronger and not as sweet! ��One knock is the salt on the margaritas glasses; it's a little too fine for my liking (seems like table salt).Otherwise, we enjoy the food, the ��low-key atmosphere and will continue going back regularly."
"Presumably one of the best restaurants in America, I was prepared to be blown away at the cuisine, elegance, presentation and ambiance of Alinea. I was not disappointed.The 18 courses were served throughout the three hour dining experience with impeccable timing, alongside well-paired wines for each. Highlights of the meal:- An entire piece of driftwood presented topped with seaweed and containing some of the best seafood I've ever tasted - Helium-filled balloon made of green apple taffy- Bowl of hardened white chocolate, filled with strawberry, English pea and lemon that was smashed onto the table in front of usMake resos far in advance!"
"Wow! ��What a disappointment! ��Althought the food was good the service was terrible. ��Owner, you cannot charge those prices without giving good service. ��He was very unprofessional and annoying."
"I love this place it's great!I particularly like their tomato sauce; it's the perfect balance between acidity and sweetness, I'd put it on anything!The bruschetta is one of my favorite appetizers so if you happen to stop by you should try it. I'd give it 5 starts but the service has been wishy-washy a few times I've been here."
"First, I must say. This is not a spanish tapas restaurant. This is a fine dining spanish restaurant. Delicious, gorgeous interior, nice service. I loved it! I LOVED IT!"
"I came in here for lunch today and it was fabulous!Prices shocked me at how much I can get for so little money. Beef sandwich for lunch with all the little extras they give you at this place. Since it was sunny today, I also opted for the fruit smoothie, fresh fruits and blended on the spot I've never tried such an amazing bubble tea. I work on a pretty tight schedule, and came in on my lunch hour, I was in and out on time back for work.Food was just delicious, and as I am able to write this from work. I plan on coming here after I get off work for dinner tonight, we'll see how that goes. I'm excited!"
"great palce, great food!"
"I came to this restaurant all excited because of the good ratings it had, but when we got there we experienced very rude and horrible service from the waiters. It was the first time eating korean bbq for me and my friends. We asked the server to teach us, but all she did was said a few words and walked away. When we ran out of water no waiter came by until an hour later. Also, when we were almost done eating, my friend had spotted a �� long brown bug crawling on the counter in the back (we had the last table by the washroom and the counter with the register). It was disgusting. This restaurant might be good for those who are familiar with korean bbq, doesnt mind rude service, and do not mind seeing bugs crawling all over."
"This is not my first review of Cafe 28 and I am sure it will not be the last. Just got home after meeting my daughter for appetizers and a drink on the patio. The cevicheis the best I have ever had , I have given up ordering it anywhere else because I am always disappointed that it is not as good as this place. ��The staff is knowledgeableand accommodating especially with my wine selection this evening. �� I have been working my way through the menu for years and have not had anything I did ��not like. The fact that it is a family ��owned establishment makes it ��even better."
I couldn't decide between 2 and 3. Sushi was yummy but not excellent. Ambiance and atmosphere was great. Service was awful. Our waiter came once to take our order and once to give us our bill (after being done eating for over 20 minutes). Nothing great. Probably will go there again just for convenience. Will give the downtown location a try.
love the food very good grate service and very good humus had the combination plate with rice loved it
"Our party of four visited Chinatown-Chicago on Labor Day, 2012, and choose to dine at Lao Sze Chuan based on reviews of best Chinese in Chicago. �� �� �� ��BAD DECISION !!!!We waited for a table for 45 minutes, were seated and waited another 10 minutes for a waiter to come and take our drink orders. ��Then another 10 minutes before he came back with the drinks, and took our dinner orders. ��He was not hospitable at all and seemed to be irritated with questions about menu items. ��It was then another 20 minutes before any appetizers and soup were brought to (and tossed on) the table. ��When the main dishes began to appear two of us in the party were served, one of the appetizers finally came out for another in the party and the fourth person (my wife) had to wait another 20 minutes before her main "
"Truly the most amazing experience I have ever had at a restaurant. ��It was also one of the most expensive meals I have ever had, but well worth it.The combination of ingredients used in the many dishes are unique and creative and often sound like they would not fit together, but are complete taste sensations. ��The various wares they use to serve the courses are mini works of art and not like anything I have ever seen.As long as you are willing to spend the money don't skimp by not doing the wine pairings. ��It does add to the already exorbitant price of the meal, but the wine pairings truly compliment each dish. ��I have been to many fine French restaurants, but none of the wines in those restaurants complimented the dishes as well as what I experienced at Alinea.This is an experience worth "
"I enjoy a night out on the town but I'm more of a sports bar kind of guy so I was very interested in checking out this new upscale sports bar I had heard about.The atmosphere is great, I like the various levels so you can get some variety without having to venture outside and go to a new place. ��This is going to be a new favorite spot for my friends and I to watch the games.We all tried the hot wings, a favorite or ours and were satisfied with them and the hot towel service when we were finished with them. ��I think the 40oz of the week, complete with its own brown paper bag - will be a big winner too."
"I'm giving this Vietnamese restaurant 5 stars as honestly, good quality and service Vietnamese food is hard to come by. ��They don't serve MSG or preservatives in their food, at least that was what I was told.Cute place, attentive waiter, way above average Vietnamese food. ��Only have not had their noodle soups. ��One thing you should definitely get is the squid salad. ��Texture and flavors gelled together in a totally unexpected wonderful way.I'm Vietnamese and this restaurant has my approval!"
"The food here is very ordinary and if you order for delivery, not only will you wait forever, but you will be lucky to get the items that you actually ordered, the way you ordered it. ��But hey, if you like poor quality and service, this one's for you."
"Always crowded.that's the only bad thing to say about this gem. The city's best beer list paired with really, really good belgian inspired food. Try the perfect mussels, cashew butter sandwich, and seasonal dishes like the rabbit. Worth the drive to Andersonville."
"Went here for a few drinks and good times...Can't wait to go back and try the food...Check this ""tucked away under the El tracks"" place out, tonight!"
"We've been to Pequod's a few times and I am finally writing a review. ��This is Chicago pizza! ��Be prepared to wait, however, because everyone knows about this place. ��I recommend making a reservation. ��You will still wait, but at least there is hope! ��The pizza itself is a terrific deep-dish that comes out hot from the oven. ��The place is beyond packed, but they have a secret upstairs that I just found out about. ��Give it a try for great Chicago pizza!"
"First of all, you can't walk past this restaurant without the scent of Ethiopian food slipping out the door like a cartoon hand and waving you inside. ��And in my experience, if it smells great, it tastes even better. ��The dishes at Demera don't disappoint. ��It's best to go with a friend (or several) and order family style, so you can sample as many dishes as possible. ��Be prepared to get messy. ��You use the spongy injera to pinch from the well-spiced piles of meat or vegetables that come served on a large platter. ��The less adventurous or the germaphobes in the crowd can order single entrees and use utensils, but you'd be missing out on a crucial part of the dining experience! ��Go, stuff your face, and leave happy. ��Just don't expect the service to match the food. ��I've rarely had a server"
"Such a fun restaurant! We were a little intimidated by the wait, but it was well worth it. Great menu, definitely try the cheese and wine. We ordered a little bit of everything for 2, and our bill was around 85."
"It was my birthday and out into the night we went. My wife, my two teenage sons and I, ��hungry.We were rejected in our first two attempts on places to eat, both closed on Monday. Driving around, on a rainy cold night looking for something good. So, third try, ��we drove over to Spacca Napoli. My wife got out of the car to check if they were open and we waited for a thumbs up...open! We walked in to Spacca Napoli and find out there is a private party going on. Sorry, ��not ��open to the public. Almost a strike three for my b-day night and then the owner queries us...After hearing our basic story he offers us a few snacks to try in the waiting area. Then, my wife adds that it is my birthday...Within five minutes we were sitting at a table with a nice bottle of red, a refreshing salad, and pizza"
"We stopped by to check out the remodel. ��The remodel is great...the food is best left for 4:00 am. ��I had a garlic shrimp dish. ��The main issue I had is that they should put the shrimp in a separate dish. ��It was bathed in butter. ��Now I like butter as much as the next guy, but I like the ability to shake the butter off, or dip it in. ��Instead, the butter ran across the surface of the dinner plate. ��So, the iceberg lettuce and my rice were sopped in butter. ��A little harder to shake butter off rice. ��The quesadillas were also strangely, seemingly dipped in butter before fried. ��The side of beans, had oil (or perhaps butter) pooling on the edges. ��The margarita tasted like it came out of a slurpee machine. ��The taco meat on the other hand was lacking flavor and was a bit dry...not buttery a"
"Best Chinese food ever.And it's not just me, plenty of my friend and family agree with that bold statement. ?I've been to other really famous Chinese restaurants in other cities that are must go to type of places and nothing can compare to Lao Sze. ?Salt & Pepper anything is good, eggplant, chili chicken, mayo shrimp, green beans, you can't go wrong."
"The Artt of Pizza is as good as it gets for deep dish. I am formerly from Hazel Crest, and have since moved to Ohio...every time I come back to Chicago for a visit, I order 3 half cooked deep dish pies to bring back home with me...yeah, it's that good! They are extremely friendly, and are very careful to take the extra steps in wrapping up my pies for the long trek back to Ohio. I would rate Art of Pizza 10 stars, but they only give you 5!"
Great Mexican food. Love the burittos.
"I was getting together with some girlfriends for brunch and chose Meli. ��I would think twice about ever going there again! ��The two hostesses at the front could hardly crack a smile at the front door as they took my name and informed me there would be a 20 min wait. ��Once seated, we were greeted by a very friendly and sweet server. ��Somehow there was some miscommunication on my friend's order and she asked for a different omelet. ��The server told us it would be no problem and returned 5 min later to inform us that the manager told her we were going to be charged for the one we sent back in addition to the one we re-ordered. ��Are you serious? ��I could see if it was a top cut of steak - but we're talking 3 eggs and some veggies here!! ��Then we asked for some more butter and were told it woul"
"went here on sunday, it was A-OK.had the sea bass which was on special, it was good, but felt it could use a tad bit more salt to bring out the flavors of the fish.their olive oil that they bring from Italy is nice.They had a house salad that was perfectly tossed in the dressing, not too much dressing and not too little.My wife had black pasta, and she was A-OK with hers also, but not blown away.The other couple that we were with, one of them was not happy about their meal and the other was just so-so.Perhaps we all ordered off things but I think we were expecting a little more, but you know, you hear so much hype sometimes you think angels are going to come singing from the sky or something.anyhow, will I go back ��. . . . .yes, I would go back; and perhaps the next time there will be some"
Please stop reinventing the wheel and use ketchup. The ketchup being served doesn't taste good. House-made should make things better. Just go back to the bad stuff.

"My mom has been a fan of this quaint place for years now. Her and my dad have been known to not only enjoy breakfast but also dinner, on the same day, at 3rd Coast.So, when we were trying to find the perfect spot to celebrate her 55-years on this beautiful Earth, we had to go with 3rd Coast Cafe. After setting up the resevation, I recieved a confirmation call from Janet. She suggested we use their baker of choice for the cake - ��an asbolutely delicious raspberry-chocolate torte.The diverse menu - oatmeal to barbeque sliders to steak - and fantastic wine selection made this the perfect spot for a group of generally indecisive ladies. ��The restaurant is delightfully unpretentious and friendly to all palates. The food, the staff, the ambiance- all beyond excellent."
The first time that I came to eat here was for my friends birthday dinner. Soon as I walked in I loved how colorful it was plus the atmosphere of it all- was great! I tried their chicken--which was very tasteful! The second time I came here I brought my boyfriend along so he can taste the awesome food. He ordered the ARACHERA which was delicious!! It was at least the best we've ever tasted! That is truly THE reason why we keep coming back.
"I love Sultan's Market! ��Their falafel sandwich is one of my top 5 favorite foods. �� Also try the Chicken shawerma and tabboule. ��The inside seating area can be a little crowded around lunch time on weekends. ��They have a large outdoor area that double the seating capacity, but don't expect it to be set up soon after they open. ��It's usually 1-2 hours after before the tables are set up. ��Make sure your bring cash. ��They don't take cards and the ATM inside charges a $2.50 service fee."
"good pizza , you just have to eat it to judge it"
I really don't understand the negative reviews? The pizza is the best. Even the next day cold out the fridge. What can I say the Chicago pizza debate goes on.
"Indie Cafe is one of my favorit neighborhood restaurants. Only a few doors down from where I live, it offers great tasting Thai and Sushi cuisine. I have turned on so many of my friends to this place and they have become repeat customers themselves. The lunch menu is a steal but portions are the right size so you don't leave hungry. In the evening it usually its quite buys. The bigger seating space is a bit more comfortable then the smaller space by the entrance. It is BYOB. Try it. You'll love it! Enjoy!"
"Easily the best saussage i have ever eaten. and no matter what i order, i am always pleased!i tell all my friends that it is worth the 30 minute wait, but smarter people just wait until either almost closing or not friday or saturday. but when you crave it, i'd personally wait an hour.Doug is the hostess with the mostess and a very kind and friendly guy. the best part about hot dougs is that no matter how long the line is, there will always (typically) be a table for you!"
"Had a deep dish large pizza with 2 friends. ��It took about 40 minutes to arrive on a Sunday night; was busy and worth the wait. ��The pizza was excellent, with great flavor and ingredients. ��We could only eat half so come hungry."
I've been coming here since I was 8. Now 25 still hitting up the best hotdog joint in the Chi. Just had it last night and it will never get old! Never had??? GET ON IT A-S-A-P!
I have been going to Superdawg ever since I was a little girl. Every time I go to Superdawg I will always get a Whoopercheesie with basically everything. Superdawg is a great drive in restaurant to go eat at night because you can go with your car and just eat in there or you can go sit out at the tables and just eat with friends and enjoy the night. I was hanging out with my boyfriend one night and I was in the mood to eat a Whoopercheesie with fries at Superdawg. When we went there that night that was his first time there and ever since that night he loves that place and he always wants to go there for a hot dog or a Whoopercheesie instead of going to Burger King and McDonald's late at night. Their service is great their so polite and they don't take forever to make your food. Also if the
"Opart Thai House is a restaurant that is near where I live, however I have never gone there, it always looked really fancy when I walked past and I thought it wasn't really the place for me. One day I went in with a couple of friends and it is a very nice place but it is also casual. It is a fabulous place to go when looking for quality Thai food. They have so many options at Opart that it is sometimes tough to choose something. One of my favorite dishes though is the Woon Sen Pad Thai. I have always been a sucker for Pad in general so I decided to try something a little different. It is not very much different; basically it is thinner noodles and a few more vegetables. It is definitely something that if you would like to stick to Pad Thai but want to change it up you should get. This is a"
this is our favorite place! have been going there for years now and always order kalbi beef. it is fun and reasonably priced. the sides are a nice addition to the beef. can't go wrong!
Great holiday BEER!!!
"The food was really great. Ate way too much which is probably the norm here. I really liked it and hope large scale uber expensive places like this can be profitable (ie. stick around) I thought the wine wall was a really nice touch (re; uber expensive place). They didn't seem to sell much wine but the trapeze artist who would descend down from the ceiling to find the wines once ordered was a really nice touch, certainly captivated me each time!"
The line is insane! OMG you've got to come early or else you'd be waiting for an hour or 2! ��I had the snake and the duck fat fries wooooo sooo goooooood! GIMME SOME MOOOOORE!!
"One of the most wonderful things about this restaurant are the options, many, many options. I have yet to have something at this restaurant that I didn't enjoy. The menu has over 20 items from which to choose. My absolute favorite is the Reuben sandwich. ��It truly tastes as though it is the real thing. (but it has been a long time since I have had meat). I always recommend this restaurant to meat and non-meat eaters as a great option for something different or for those of us vegetarians who enjoy being able choose from more than one item on the menu or without having to modify an existing item.."
Grand lux is a great restaurant the atmospher is great the food is great perfect for that romantic dinner with that special someone or just a night to hang out with the girls I give it five stars!!!!
"tried dining in the restaurant rather than getn it delivered, and god bless them they are so nice in there but they did not understand a word of the orders we made, we ordered fried rice and 2 diet cokes and mango beef. she arrived with 2 ice teas and satay shrimp. lolwatever this place is great but maybe since the delivery is so good ill stick to that"
We went there with friend in town for visiting. Food and service is OK.
"this place is cool and i have to say there is really nothing like it in chicago. ?i ALMOST feel like it's trying a LITTLE TOO HARD, but it's worth the wait and price. ?the drinks are super chic and made with ALL homemade, natural, and fresh ingredients. ?no super sugary drinks here. ?even the ice cubes are freshly cut. ?yes cut from an ice block. ?wow. ?this place seems like it stepped right out prohibition except it's tres chic. ?i love the decor. ?and the fact that it has a plain plywood exterior makes it that much better. ?yes, you will wait and yes it is a little pricey, but like i said it's worth it. ?i love the no cell phone policy. ?this place is quiet so it would be super annoying if i had to listed to some suburbanite yelling to her friend on the phone about how crowded soundbar i"
"Service was fantastic, great selection of food, everything seemed very fresh. The only thing is that the gumbo I had the night we went tasted like it had too much molasses in it (if that's an ingredient). I'm by no means an expert or have even been to LA to try the real thing. It was just too syrupy and sweet for my palate. Everything else was awesome. I think they have a kids eat free from 4-6 as well..."
"I brought my boyfriend to Bon Soiree for his birthday dinner, off of two groupons.Verdict:1) amuse-bouche: ��excellent2) salad with figs and truffle oil: ��Ok, bland3) 'campfire' in a beef box (apple and smoked bacon): honestly would have been just as happy with my hometown bbq4) equivalent to butternut squash soup: ��VERY tasty5) 5 different kinds of eggplant with lobster: lobster good, but how hard is that to do, eggplants ; nothing special, bland6) equivalent to beef stroganoff: ��I don't want you to mimic beef stroganoff firstoff. Wagyu beef was decent, though one of my pieces was the fatty end. Overall the combination of foods, especially the creme fraiche did not sit well.7) cheese- this was pretty good, but really? this counts as a course?8) homemade graham cracker with scallop marshmal"
"The granola is the only thing this place has going for itself. ��The hot food is pre-made and heated up, the staff is rude, and the atmosphere is chaotic. Everything that makes a good brunch--a nice conversation with my friends, a mimosa, some good food...this place lacks. ��With so many GREAT brunch places in the area, there's really no need to brave this place."
I can't get enough. ��The varity. ��The laid back joint.I love the hot dogs here. ��If I have two things to pick about it is the long lines (but that just proves they are great!) and the way my stomach feels after my 4th hot dog in a row.
"why 3 stars? ��because I like to have a few drinks with dinner and the drinks here are expensive! ��A johnny walker black with soda is $9 - thats more that most clubs in Chicago! �� My wife and I went with another couple and we spent close to $60 on just drinks. ��I wish they reconsider the price of their liquor.The food is good, but the price of liquor would deter me from going again ."
"If you haven't been here yet, then it is too late. Bonsoiree had a great prix fixe menu, before, with a $20 3-course menu. That ��has changed to a $24 ��prix fixe menu with 80% of the menu sporting an * denoting a $5-$10 mark up. what used to be a great deal is now way overpriced with Tiny portions. Only the bread pudding is worth your while. It's byob status has also changed to include corkage. lame."
"I've had the pleasure of visiting Vietnam, and this is the food I had the pleasure of discovering there: bright, seasonal and fresh ingredients, surprisingly subtle and refined flavors, masterful simplicity. For authentic, thoughtfully prepared Vietnamese cuisine in Chicago, Simply It really is simply it. Standouts: Pho (beef), Asparagus and King Crab Soup, Five Spice Duck Salad, Simply It's Fried Rice"
"Quickly becoming one of my favorite neighborhood casual restaurants. ��Been for dinner twice and lunch twice and it's been excellent. ��The flavors are very expansive, so it's a good idea to order entrees to share so you can sample several things. ��The catfish and mango beef are highlights, but it's all been good.For lunch you can do a sandwich combo for 7 bucks, which also includes soup, salad, egg roll, drink, and fruit for desert. Great deal, and the sandwiches are quite generous, not to mention tasty. Give it a try."
"Stopped in there last week and really wanted to like it. If you're into actual hard rock and good food go to Kumas. If you're into an authentic bar that isn't trying way too hard to tell everyone how cool they are go down the street to Five Star on Chicago (or Happy Village in the Summer). If you're a d-bag who wasn't able to get into Cans then this is your place. A hokey ""prison"" theme would be hysterical if they weren't serious. This is more like a ""hard rock bar"" (Nickelback?!) you would find at Epcot Center than something that should be in a great neighborhood like Wicker Park / West Town. Food is way too average to swallow your pride and risk being seen in this wanna-be something. Plenty of other options in the neighborhood."
Oh Let's Have A War-I will surely surrender.Please pass the popcorn.
"I love Garcia's! ��I usually get the carne asada, which seems pretty wimpy, except it's so damn delicious! ��I've also had the burritos, enchiladas, flautas, tacos, and whatever else they put in front of me.My only complaint, such as it is, is that the guacamole is inconsistent. ��Some days, it's an A+ and other days, it's ��a C-. ��But, overall, it's just rocking!"
"I love coming to this place. I had actually been here before when it used to be a tapas bar .... and I must say it only got better. The food is to die for ... for anyone who likes waffle fries you HAVE to try them. The burgers are great too, try the ""triple secret"" I'm telling you, you won't regret it. But one of the best parts of the bar is ..... THE FORTY OUNCERS. What screams ""class"" more than a brown paper bag and a huge bottle of beer. If you don't get a kick outta that then I probably don't wanna hang out with you. I'm pretty harsh in these reviews. but this place is legitimately awesome."
Relly like this place a lot - my husband like this place a lot - we asked for gift certificates here for Christmas - can't wait to go again and I'm not even a big sushi person!
"I took the #77 bus from my apartment to about 2 blocks away from Hot Doug's. During the bus ride it started down pouring so by the time I got to the restaurant I looked like a drowned rat. The decor is pretty cool. Kind of a 50's diner throwback with a modern twist. I'm pretty sure Doug actually took my order, he was super friendly and it seems he treats all his customers like he knows them - very inviting atmosphere. ?I ordered the The Paul Kelly with fries and a small drink. I was surprised that you were allowed to grab your own cup, and get free refills. I waited around five minutes and got my food (I went at 3pm). It was amazing. Who would have thought that a bratwurst and fries might be one of the best meals I've ever eaten. I also only spent around 6 bucks for the entire meal. Its in"
best pizza around
"First off, my husband and I love the food. It is not important to us that some dishes are not authentic, all we care about is that the food taste deliciouso, margaritas is really good, prices are reasonable and it is very convenient for us to stop by after work when we feel lazy to cook at home. The location is also very nice with other small shops in the Lincoln Square strip. However, there is a certain waiter that we always wish wld not be our server, unfortunately we are not always in luck and the latest incident was I thought very annoying and worthy of sharing (thus the 3 stars only rating). This guy is unbelievable. We order a pitcher of margarita right after the bus boy serves us the usual salsa and chips. We are on our 2nd salsa and chips and still no margaritas. In the meantime, w"
Delicious food and great service.
We took our family of five and had a truly wonderful dining experience. ��Every item seem to be served right on cue. ��Every dish was a flavor-filled joy with bursts unexpected excitement.
"Alright, so I was definitely pretty stoked about trying this place out. ��It wasn't a let down, per se, but it didn't overly wow me as some others have written.The staff was super friendly - definitely a very chill vibe, they helped with our order and even gave us some recommendations. ��Pretty cool and much appreciated.The food was stellar - I ordered the Cubano, although I expected it to be much bigger...they definitely hired some good photographers for their website, as the pics don't really accurately reflect what you get.With that said it was definitely solid, very tasty. ��I also ordered the goat cheese empanada, which I'd recommend in a heartbeat (I can't see how you could mess up a pastry filled with goat cheese...).Quick note though on the shakes that everyone raves about....I defini"
Went here for lunch the other day. That blackened tilapia sandwich was soooooo good. I really like their salads too. The bloody mary cannot be beat. It is the best bloody mary in the city.
Everybody knows how amazing Doug's is. ��I just wanted to do my part to get it into the five star realm.
Wow! This crazy cool asians have my heart. They have greatness in every dish! I recommend the chicken basil and the classic pad thai!! So good!
"Love this place! The food is really good, but I take 1-star off for customer service. ��I'be been here about 5 times, and 2 of the times we had less-than-stellar service from our waiter/waitress.Most of the time the service is good though, and even when it's not the best...the food is still good. ��You can tell they really are making the food there- not just re-heating something frozen. ��So it takes a little longer to get your food, but it's a nice quiet atmosphere that you can't help but enjoy relaxing while you wait for your food.Breakfast ALL DAY...yum. Scones and pancakes are both fabulous. ��Lots of people there reading the paper, or working on assignments because it's nice and quiet."
"Although the staff is pleasant and smiling (as mentioned in Time Out), I couldn't believe that when I wanted extra sauce for a dish I had already ordered and was in the midst of eating, they stated it was an additional $2. ��Really?? ��You're kidding, right! ��The same for additional pot sticker sauce! ��I would never return because of this penny pinching policy."
"If you're in Chicago on a Sunday night, have a spare $6 and some scratch for a few drinks, you can't go wrong with the Green Mill. ��Even if you've got other plans -- this should *at least* be your backup plan. ��Sunday night Poetry Slam has never failed to be a great time. ��Marc Smith is probably one of the most accessible, friendly icons that you'll ever meet, and if you're standing at the bar during the break, he's about as likely to start a conversation with you as he is with anybody -- he's just that friendly.The staff. ��I've learned by observation -- be cool, respectful with the staff and they'll be cool and respectful with you. ��They're professionals, not peons."
"I went there this evening for dinner and it was perfect! ��The food was seasoned perfect and it was worth the $$$. ��I love that it is BYOB. ��Our waitress was so kind, warm, and professional you could tell she truly cared if we were having a good time. ��I just moved here with my wife a few months ago, and this is the best place we have tried. ��She even was so kind to recommend some of her favorite places to eat.We ordered the 7 course and received items like lobster, veal cheeks, and spare ribs smoked in a box. ��I saw that the table next to us didn't eat meat, so they received things like sable-fish for a sub. It was only $85 a person, and you bring your own wine so its a great deal. ��The decor is very comfortable, like you are eating dinner at someones home. ��The tables are not too close to"
"folks, listen up. i need to free the blinders from your eyes. i think this place has really fooled the NPR/This American Life/Check Please crowd into thinking that this is actually any good. the food is very mediocre and authentic in as far as it's probably cooked by vietnamese hands. but it's not authentic in the way that other way that vietnamese food is authentic; that is to say, that it's delicious and actually worth putting into your mouth.over the course of two years of reluctantly eating there (when out of town vietnamese family members / friends are in town and want to eat at a place where they see the most people inside, especially ""nguoi My,""), we've tried most of the menu and in two years the quality has sunk lower and lower. the pho broth is bland, the noodles taste like they'r"
"Update-I wanted to let the readers know, that I received a sincere apology from the waitress and the manager regarding the incident. ��This is greatly appreciated. Sometimes its not what you have done, but how you react to it... and Hopleaf has acted with extreme class. ��Mistakes do happen, and I am willing to give Hopleaf another try."
"Get the Old Fashion, I got many.Brunch is good, dinner is better. ��Try to bone marrow. ��It's absolutely delicious and strangely satisfying to spoon it out of a sawed off femur (I'm guessing on the anatomy).I've found the staff very helpful. ��My girlfriend and I went there on a slammed Valentines Day night and waited about an hour for a table. ��The staff took our number while we went to another restaurant for a drink and called us when our table was ready. ��That's much more than I can say for other local establishments.I appreciate their adventurous dishes. ��It's really a pleasure"
"Why do I love Violet Hour? Because it is like no where else I have ever been.Walking into the Violet Hour feels like walking into another time and place. They restrict the amount of people who enter so that everyone has a seat and it never gets too crowded. A policy that I adore.I went on a Friday night around 9:00pm, and so I had to wait about 45 min. There was also some minor confusion the night I went so I shall clear it up right here: You must give your name/cell number to the host at the front of the line. No matter what anyone else in line says.Once inside and seated you will notice the low lighting, gorgeous chandeliers and high backed chairs. The bartenders are dressed in traditional old-school bartender garb, which adds a posh air.On to the drinks: Amazing! All mixers are fresh an"
I was disappointed with the rude service and wait time. The food was not spectacular like the other reviews say. Maybe I went at a bad time or it was just a bad day.
"My, my, what a dinner! ��I was here with a group of six, and had to wait at the bar for about a half hour but that's not bad with no rezzies! ��When we got seated the waiter brought our drinks and a menu. ��From the time we sat down to the time our appetizers came out was literally 10 minutes, fantastic! ��My steak was cooked to perfection, exactly the way I ordered it, and our waiter was amazing. ��Attentive, not hounding; friendly, not intrusive; polite, not stand-offish or meek. ��The whole experience was definitely 5 star in every way!"
"This place is pretty good. The beers that they brew are all pretty good. I don't think they're the best thing in the world, but they're good. They're reasonably priced. It's kind of a nice novelty.The burgers are really the deal. They're big, they're delicious. The pizza leaves a bit to be desired. I don't know why they're doing pizzas--they're just not that good. But the sandwiches are great. The chicken sandwich even is pretty good. I don't usually get a chicken sandwich, but I dare you not to like theirs.What else...service is find. The atmosphere is pretty nice in that it's got a bit of a hipster feel to it, but it's not dark and loud. It caters to a wide variety of people."
"My husband and I come here once a week. We love it. The sushi is consistent and fresh. Great service and bring your own. I recommend it to anyone, especially if you live in the neighborhood. It's affordable, the decor is pleasant, and the food is fantastic."
"Really delicious! I love their strawberry OJ and they have the best corned beef hash!It gets so crowded during peak times on the weekends, but if you catch it early enough this place is a great south loop option for breakfast!"
"This was my first dining experience in Chicago and I loved it! The atmosphere was great, the service was great and the food was exceptional. ��The price not bad but were from Michigan and everything is so much more pricey in Chicago"
Better than Olive Garden but way to crowded with wannabe's.Erratic service in an atmosphere similar to the subway in rush hour. Some of the dishes are interesting ��and worth trying but the pasta is usually overlooked.
We ordered our wedding cake from Alliance (it was part of a package from the venue). ��Alliance worked with us on getting the flavors we wanted - strawberries and banana (banana custurd).Many guests remarked it was the best wedding cake they tasted. ��I thought it was delicious and it looked great.
I love this place I have been going there for the past few years.I usually skip the salad bar I save my tummy for there delisious meats and the rice and beans with hot peppers is awsome that is something extra you have to order from the side but you must try it.
"You can tell by the rest of the reviews on here that this place is a top notch Italian restaurant with great food, service and atmosphere.. So i won't waste your time with that. What you do need to know is how unbelievably delicious the milk and honey ribs are. ��I went into the evening imagining a big plate of tasty pasta or ravioli but when the waiter told us about the ribs, I was sold. ��I am so glad i listened because i can't imagine ribs tasting any better than these did. ��The meat was so delicious and just fell off the bones.. ��Not messy at all and easy to eat with your fork. ��Served with a side of shoe string sweet potatos bathing in the milk and honey sauce. ��Not sure if they're always on the menu because it was a special the night I had them, but don't discount them just because you"
Had a great dinner meeting here recently when traveling to Chicago. ��Very creative presentation and excellent foodie delights.
The food is fantastic! You can totally tell that its made with so much love and affection. Its fresh and tasty and so different from the regular middle eastern and mediterranean places.

"My boyfriend and several of our friends were lucky enough to get a reservation here last minute. ��We brought the chefs a 12 pack of specialty crafted brew, and they loved it!. ��I highly recommend bringing a small gift of some sort of achohol. ��It will go along way. ��I can't really say anything that hasn't been before about this place, but I loved it. ��I am a huge foodie and have eaten at practically every hot spot in Chicago and this place is truly different. ��When we went there the head chef ended up sitting at our table and had drinks with us and talked with us about all sorts of culinary delights for almost the whole dinner. ��The presentation and execution of the food was magnificent, however some plates weren't to my liking. ��I can be very picky with whats in my food, so it was probabl"
"Well, dine-in might be good, I've tried that.. but I'm pretty disappointed in the latest delivery-to-your-door treat I splurged on. Full slab of ribs.. arrived not-too hot, medium-warm in fact. Kind of on the dry side. Side of spaghetti with meat sauce was hotter, but could have used, oh, 300% more meat sauce. ��Salad was unimpressive. Bread was good. ��Delivery person was (as they all seem to be) unapologetic ��for the not-hot food. ��I think it should be same temp delivered to  ��your door as delivered to your table; microwave reheating does ��NOT enhance ��any dish. �� When you can get it, though, the cream of mushroom soup �� is....wunnerful!"
"I LOVE Le Colonial !Service here is always up to par. And that's another thing that shocks me. I used to work at a restaurant as a hostess and I would notice that there would be days where the servers were not serving at their highest potential, which is understandable. We are human and have our less than satisfactory days. However, evrytime I dine at Le Colonial the service is always excellent. This restaurant, which includes the decor, the food, the presentation, the service, the wine deserves an A++. I've never been disappointed here for any reason. I've loved or liked everything that I've tried here, and I can almost call their desserts heavenly creations.You can't go wrong here at all."
"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Why? Because it kicks ass. Let me elaborate:They don't try to do a lot of things. They focus on encased meats and then get wildly creative within that area. They serve a veritable Noah's Ark of animals throughout the year. I have eaten delicious animals from all over the world, wonderfully seasoned and served with surprisingly perfect appropriate toppings. I would never have thought to combine cherries, elk, and blue cheese but I am damn glad that Hot Doug's did.Other things to consider: 1) they have an inexpensive, amazing dog that used to be named the Shawon Dunston (now the Dave Kingman). Solid good eating for under $5. 2) Best corn dogs ever.3) Best fries in town. And I'm not even talking about the duck-fat fries (which are incendiary and insp"
"Not the best breakfast I've had, but it's convenient and decent enough to visit every now and then."
So much delish meat! The salad bar is wonderful and the meats are amazing. Service is great also. No complants!
"I first have to admit that it could be because we're from LA and there's plenty of great mexican food around here; homestyle, authentic, cheap, expensive, etc.So kudos to Rick for opening the restaurant in Chicago where the next best thing has to be Chipotle...2 words, overhyped and overpriced."

"I've been to Mastro's twice. The first time I had dinner in the bar area, which was nice, but noisy. So if you're looking for more of an intimate setting, definitely choose the dining room. The second time I was seated in the upstairs dining room, which is very dark and dimly lit. It is so dark that you can barely read the menu. Servers will provide you with light if needed. Surprisingly, there isn't much ambiance at all in the dining area. It reminded me of a banqet room with tables and chairs set up for an event. I was surprised by the lack of decor, but I came for the food. The steaks are excellent and cooked to perfection, sides dishes are great and they also have a great wine selection. My friend had the shrimp cocktail and said it was top notch! Service is also great. This is a great"
"While I try to love this restaurant, I think they have far too many rules and expectations of their diners. Who the hell goes to a restaurant's website to check the ""RULES"". I had the most ridiculous interaction with Mark a while back based on one of their rules...I am somewhat over it. I do think it was in poor taste to bring in your own cake without calling first, and I also think their rather bitchy commentary on yelp over the scenario was a bit over the top. Everyone's a critic and most feel so entitled to let their mindless drool spill out of their mouths, especially a bunch of twits. WhatEV's!!! The girls look like they might be better suited to have their parties at ""I've Been to a Marvelous Party"" over in the ""village"". I think you can bring your own everything there.Peacep.s. the "
"Best pizza in Chicago, hands down! Zagat rated, don't be fooled by the tourist traps off Michigan Ave. Art of Pizza is the real deal. I've been here every time I'm in Chicago. Pick any Chicago style pizza, you won't be disappointed!! Personal face is sausage and spinach. Amazing!!!"
"What a nice memorable experience! ��Very good food, amazing presentation. ��You can tell the chef cares about each dish that leaves his/her kitchen. ��On the pricey side but worth every penny in my opinion."
I loved the atmosphere. ��One of the best Vietnamese restaurants I have ever been to. ��The owner was very nice as well as the atmosphere in general. ��I would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys high class Vietnamese cuisine.
Hands down the best pizza in chicago. The food is there is something youll find your self talking about ��when ever u hear the word Pizza. I love there food. The next best thing about this place is there delivery. If your like me and like to stay in and pop a movie and order pizza then this is your spot. There drivers r the best. They always get to me quick and the pizza is always hot unlike father and son or chicago pizza. ��So if your looking for a unique and tasteful pizza place with express delivery then Pequods is your place.
"After a little discussion with a friend of mine about meeting up for brunch, she told me that one of her friend raved about this place and we should try it out..It was a Sunday at about 10am and very suprisingly no wait but the restaurant was already quite busy and we were put in a tiny table near the restroom/back door area.. It wasn't the best seat in the house obviously but at least we got a table..My friend ordered the pancakes with a side of scrambleeggs ��and i ordered the granola bowl.. ��The food was pretty good and pretty much satisfying for brunch although i would prefer more fruit for my granola and yogurt.. (it was hardly any fruit pieces in the bottom) but the ""House Made"" granola was amazing (just like many people have said on yelp).. ��The fresh squeezed orange juice was also g"
"The food is good and they give u a lot of food! Prices are reasonable though. The place is beautiful, great atmosphere. Tends to get pretty loud.From the 3 times I've been here, the wait is awfully and unfortunately long. Worst thing is they won't allow u to call and make a reservation unless it's for 4+ people.Service is good though. Not a bad place to go for good food."
This past Saturday was my third time to this establishment and I have to say the food has been absolutely delicious every single time I have been here. ��The duck is the best I have ever tried. ��My one complaint is that the service was not up to par. We waited at our table for twenty minutes before a server even came over and asked us if we would like something to drink and that was after we waived down a different bus boy to go get him. �� Then after our food arrived he never came back to check on to see if we needed anything. ��I don't know about you but I prefer a drink with my meal.
"Alinea, oh yes. ��I would go here every week if i could, it is so great. ��From the insanely coiffed sommelier who knows wine as if it flows in his veins, to the extremely knowledgeable waiters, to the serious chef who comes out to prepare the incredible piece of art that becomes an orgy of a dessert....flawless. ��Grant Achatz is undisputably a genius. ��Usually i am pretty wordy in my reviews but Alinea left me sort of speechless and awestruck, if that tells you anything. ��It's been a month and a half since we ate there and I still think about it and wonder if I'll ever go there again, and find myself plotting ways to get back to Chicago, if only for one more meal here."
"Nice place if you fell like wasting away in line. Can you do carry out? Do you still have to wait in line?Sausages rock, duck fries not so much."
"The single star is because yes, this bar has awesom drinks and once you get inside the service is fairly good. However, both of those positives are almost entirely negated by the doorman and the inconsiderate way in which they treat their potential patrons prior to allowing them entrance (where they then charge approximately $15 per drink - which is fine in some places, but more than almost any other place in Chicago.) ��I have been several times and am always frustrated and a little insulted by the rudeness of the doorman (always the same guy.) �� Once we got in almost immediately, because one of my party gave him some money. ��Every other time, we have waited for over an hour. ��That is both ridiculous and inconsiderate for a place that refuses to take reservations and does not provide a com"
"One of the best sushi places in the city. Ask for anything. Anything at all and it is amazing! I went with 11 of my girlfriends and was pleased that one of them suggested this place because I would have never known it was there. Try the seared tuna. A must! Hamachi Avo is great. But honestly, I cant tell you enough, I cant describe this place well enough you must go in and see. Coast is beautiful! The service is great. Good atmosphere for an itimate meeting or a place where 12 people want to reconnect over great sushi! Highly recommend it!"
"Been here multiple times and each time is great! ��Consistently delivers great food and service as well an people watching. ��I think I have dreams of their brussel sprout salad, the rock shrimp and the crispy tuna! ��The dessert RIDICULOUS is the most amazing dessert I have ever ate and hands down the best dessert in Chicago :) ��If you can get an outside table in the summer you're in for a treat as it is intimate and very enjoyable!"
"We were visiting from seattle and heard this restaurant is the bomb, so we had to try it out and it is really amazing. ��It is the best Vietnamese food we had ever. ��We always thought Seattle has the best Vietnamese food but when we tried Simply It, we were impressed with everything the restaurant offered. The food is authentic using fresh ingredients with a French influence. ��They have competent wait staff and a very nice and friendly owner. ��He treated us as nicely as everyone wants to be treated."
"I need an intervention please. I am officially addicted to 90 Miles, 4 times in one week. The food, service the patio that makes you feel like you been transported to the forbidden land and to top things off they are selling Cuban mojito mix by the pitcher and we brought our rum. This place is simple and unique. Love it !!! I need some 90 right now."
"What if Dominos collaborated with Lou Malnatis?Come now... Is this really what you want from a pizza? Pan pizza is just Focochia's red-headed-step-child.Long live deep dish! Oh and Armonds! Dig!?!No, Seriously... This is some good pizza if pan is your thing, but that carmelized (ahem, burnt) crust is suspiciously similar to Dominos Pan Pizza."
The BEST hot dog in the world !
We got the tasting menu - one word to describe it AMAZING. ��We also got an awesome bottle of wine. ��I would definitely recommend it. ��Downside is it is a little pricey but I think it is worth it.
"Graham Elliot really deserves 4 1/2 stars, unfortunately this rating system only allows whole stars. ��It's a wonderful experience to dine here. From the atmosphere, attentive wait staff, to the interesting, flavorful, artful combination of food. ��The food tastes as good as the presentation is received which is outstanding. ��If you go soon, I highly recommend the onion soup...the online menu is not updated. ��For summer it's a very fresh onion soup with pickled ramp which is just delicious and adds a nice sweet contrast to the savory nature of onions. ��The creativeness is in creating dishes with the same ingredient in different ways. ��For example the jidori chicken has carrots 4 ways (roasted, pureed, foamed, and cereal) all unique texture and tastes which combined with the other flavorful f"
"The deep dish pizza was great! As other people have said it does take about 35-40mins for pizza to arrive, but I found this tone a great time to sit and converse with friends!Will be going back again."
I agree with Jon down there... ONE biscuit for $6? Don't call it biscuits. ��Go to hell.
Excellent service! Lovely decor! Love the beef lo mein!
"I have dined at all the brazillian steak houses in chicago (Foga, Brazzaz, etc) and Texas de Brazil is by far the best out of all of them. ��you get endless amounts of meat, the drinks are great, and the service is awesome. ��It is a little expensive but you get more than enough food for what you pay. ��For a little tip of advise, if you fill out the survey after you are done eating or if you sign up on-line to there email list you will receive great money saving coupons (like buy one entree mon-thurs get one free)"
"Good/ bad: pretty friendly staff. However, at one point in time the waiter came over to our table, and the table next to ours, apparently in search of something? She never gave us a proper explanation....she just kind of bent over and looked under our tables. Awkward? Yeah, just a tad. The sushi is pretty good, but I've had better. It's a bit crowded and loud. The chairs are unbelievably comfortable!"
"Worth the trip! I read the reviews before coming to Chicago to find a good mexican restaurant and found the Mayan Palace had 1/2 price margaritas on Tues/Thurs. ��We were arriving Thursday so this was great. ��Did the touristy thing at Navy Pier, ate a so so hot dog (know that is not the place to get a good Chicago dog but we were hungry after taking the L from O'Hare. ��Finally made it to Mayan Palace around 4 pm, no one was there so thought the reviews were some how off, but ordered a small pitcher of Margaritas and could smell the tequila when the server poured a glass. NICE!!! We had the cerviche which was ok and ordered another pitcher since we weren't really hungry. ��The server was so nice and didn't get mad that we didn't order any food. ��I'd go back to try some food and get more marga"
"i live in la....beverly hills to be exact...this place has something very very special about it....and someone said in there review pseudo-trendy, wannabe sunset, overly pretentious, well i would have to say most definenlty not! coming from la this was nothing to the sort..people in los angeles would flip out if they had something like this in there town...chicago...you have a diamond in the rough...enjoy it!!!!"
AAA+Excellent in every way!!!
"Really nice casual place with outside eating. I either eat in or carry out. Great food, reasonable prices and nice service keeps me coming back! Great milk shakes too!"
"Oh my sweet gherkins!!!I went there last week after helping some friends move and I have FOUND MY NEW WING SPOT!!! The wings are super CRISPY! Apparently they use a gluten free flour to batter the wings and this enhances the crispness. Really, there's nothing worse than a slimy, over breaded, chewy chicken wing.... Needless to say these wings were fabulous!! As for sauces, I highly recommend the Seoul Sassy. I tried the Crisp BBQ, which seemed more enticing because of the great red color, but after the taste test, it was the Seoul Sassy that won my heart. By the way, the steak bowl was pretty darn good too."
"Unfortunately I didn't get as good of a experience as I had hoped. After reading the many reviews which were pretty good I was excited. Drove all the way to Chicago and was disappointed.The service was ok. I wasn't expecting for much but she barely came to check on us. The food was ok. There are a lot of side dishes! I liked most of them. We wanted to order tripe but the waitress told us that IT WASN'T GOOD. We were kinda shocked but since she gave us her opinion we decided not to try it. We got the brisket, bulgogi, and marinated ribs. I like the marinated ribs and my sister liked the bulgogi.I don't think I'll be going back. I wasn't full or satisfied. Hopefully, others will have a better experience than me."
"i live 3 blocks from longman and im kicking my own ass for waiting so long to try it! me and my girl friend went to eat brunch on monday and it was AMAZING. we shared the french toast and the chicken and waffle. Both were to die for. From what i hear the weekends are a bit of a shit show to get a table, but if you come in on a weekday you can get a seat right away. Our waitress was very nice and the food lived up to its standard. I even let a perfect stranger try some of my french toast! his eyes lit up when it hit our table and i couldn't resist to share. we will def be back for more!"
"Definitely the best place I've ever been for a nice, romantic date. ��The staff is very friendly as well. ��The cheese fondue is unbelievable, and the dipping sauces served with the main course are perfect. ��Thanks for a great night, Geja's!"
"They f'd up my reservation, so the manager gave us a bunch of free beer. ��That was awesome.Good pizza, lots of TVs."
I agree the management is horrible. I've came here on a Sat. night when the place was busy (not to long ago) and was treated horribly by a male host only to sit an hour later after I had reservations. They simply didn't care we were on a time schedule. It was very upsetting when were leaving to find the manager leaning against the bar chatting with the host and staring at his feet. No goodbye have a good night! I probably will never be back at this location as I found Taylor Street to be very attentive.
"Wsa there on New Year's eve. I was disappointed with the experience at Brazzaz. Compared to my visits with other Brazilian Steak House, this was a disappointment. Our server came at the beginning and he was not seen around. The servers did not stop at our table to serve the steaks. I had to ask people working there to remind the servers to stop in our table too. I had ask this TWICE, which is higly unuusual in a Brazilian Steak house. It might be because of the location of our table. I actually mentioned this to our table waiter at the end that the servers were not stopping in our table. The meat choise was very limited, taste is OK, seems to be more spicy to my taste. The salad bar is fine. I was excited to go to another Brazilian steak house, but it was not a pleasant experience."
"Tea, salad, soup, egg rolls and your choice of bahn mi sandwich all for 6.95! You can get much better than that. The service was friendly and fast. If you hankerin for a good meal I highly recommend!"
"So it was my surrogate mothers birthday, so she asked (all 5 of us 1 bro 3 sisters) us if she can go out to dinner. (because were are never around each-other) So she lives around that area so she was telling us abut this great place RJ GRUNTS. And we all agreed to go there and the place was so packed with people.(thats a good thing) And not to talk about the food but it was so great everybody got somthing different. And we all tryed eachothers dishes they served so much on the plate that all so filled when we left (and the bill was under $100 including drinks to feed all 6 hungry people-- what a deal!!)..................I WILL BE A LOYAL COSTUMER TO THIS PLACE BECAUSE IT WAS ALL IN ALL SO GREAT OF A NIGHT ---------------- i highly recommen this place to everybody!!!!"
I love this place.....I have been going here for at least a decade.On my last trio here we had their pizza which was great.the service is prompt and on the weekends the atmosphere is great with a live band and all.
Hands down the best steak in the city!
We went ��last weekend recommended by Guy Fieri (food network show). We had a large chifrijo and pepito sandwich that we shared. The service is excellent the food is great. The price is fair. We tried the Jamaica-lime tea very delicious. Will be returning! ��I gave it 3 stars because I have only been here once. Don't have other times to compare it with. Hope the second time is just as good.
"I posted this a year or two ago but will repeat my simple Hot Dougs strategy for beating the often long line. ��It helps that I work kitty-corner from Dougs, so this is easy for me, but here it is: ��first, go online to http://hotdougs.com and figure out what you want to order - then, just call ahead (773-279-9550) and place your order for pickup - it will be ready when you arrive (give them 5-10 minutes), you can walk right in past the line and either get it to go or grab a table on the spot if one's open (don't forget about the Al Fresco outdoor dining area - named after the used-car lot on Ashland where Doug bought his Dodge Dart)(I made that up). ��CAVEAT: ��they won't take phone orders on Saturdays, and they won't take advance orders for eat-in customers. �� Good luck!"
"I am a big fan of steaks, and Texas de Brazil satisfied my carnivore fix. ��The selection of meat offerings were selective and great tasting. ��Unique way of serving steak though, so it was really enjoyable. ��Parking is a downside and the price might be a little over-the-top, but overall worth the experience."
"If you want Chicago style deep dish pizza, then you have to go to Giordano's. The best location for visitors is of course the one off of Rush St., inside the Miracle Mile area. However, you will most likely have to wait 30-45 min if you are going on the weekend because they are always very busy then. Its probably worth it though. I prefer their pizza over other places that serve deep dish for some reason."
Solid Sliders and good pours (although I could do w/out the bacon in the bloody mary) - recommended.
"I have been to Sunda three times, and I should preface this review by saying I don't like Sushi and am not generally a fan of Asian food. ��Despite these preferences, I think Sunda is very very good. ��The menu is very diverse and offers many different options, so those who do not care for Sushi still have a considerable number of choices. ��I've tried several of the Sushi options here and have liked most of them. ��The lobster and waygu roll is amazing. ��The Chilean Sea Bass is some of the best fish I've had...moist and delicate, in an interesting preparation. ��The Crabcake Ahi Tuna is unique and also excellent. ��On each occassion the sevice had been friendly and fairly good. ��My only difficulty with this restaurant is the noise level. ��On a crowded night, it becomes almost impossible to carr"
"Food 3/5Drinks policy 5/5Service 5/5Ambiance 5/5 (for a nice summer evening)We ordered an empanadas appetizer, a chicken dinner, and a steak dinner. The empenadas were amazing, especially the goat cheese variety. I would easily order that again. The dinners on the other hand... my steak was thin and cheap, the chicken was thin-cut and cheap as well, and even worse for it than the steak.I find that it doesn't really matter though when you're sitting outside in their outdoor section on a great summer evening, pouring your own rum in front of you. If you found this place because it is BYO, then you're like to get too drunk to care much about the quality of the food anyway.Its $10 for a pitcher of Mohito mix. I think this is an essential part of the experience.I had a lot of fun and would love"
"We walked passed it few times. ��That is it's charm and decor inside. ��Drinks are really good, Sangria was made with some expensive wine, but fresh fruits and everything..... ��I would recommend this for a nice date..."
"WOW!!!we came in as a group of 17 people last weekend and it was just superb. I made reservations for my birthday a week in advance and as we came in our table was set and ready for my friends and I.BYOB is definitely a plus here, I love the option of bringing your own--for free! Onto the food, it was excellent. Lemongrass beef, avocado wontons, callamari salad and seafood eggrolls. With my personal entree I had a nice hot bowl of their Beef Noodle soup. Service was also excellent, very attentive, kept good care of us, and seemed very friendly. They also put birthday candles on my cake, turned off all the lights in the dining room and sang Happy Birthday to me, what other restaurant does that?!?! It was so fun!! The atmosphere of the restaurant was busy, but I love the decorations of the r"
"The food here is excellent and you cannot beat the price. �� The service could be faster, but well worth the wait"
"Went to GE this weekend. From start to finish, the worst dining experience of our lives!8pm reservation - walked in an hour early at 7pm and was greeted by a girl who looked like she just got out of a production of Little House on the Prairie; faded jeans and some weird top; not what a front door hostess should be wearing. The waiting staff were dressed just fine in dark blue jeans and coat jackets. We saw three open tables and the hostess said we would have to wait and have a seat at the bar. She said she would come and get us closer to 8pm. The whole 45 minutes no one filled these three tables. Earlier I was drinking tropical drinks and so at the bar I asked the bartender if he had pineapple juice. He said, ""no"". This is a Michelin star restaurant and no pineapple juice at the bar! One h"
I asked the doorman at the hotel I was staying at where was the best deep dish in chi-town. He said it was Giordano's.I got a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. The first thing I noticed was the weight of the pizza. It was really heavy. It is truly a pizza pie. The taste was amazing. The best pizza I have ever eaten so far (I have not been to NYC yet). I liked it so much I went back on my last day in the city.The only downside is that it takes 40 minutes for them to make each pizza but its worth the wait.
The pizza was super delicious
Absolutely great food and service. I have been coming here ever since they opened and gotta say they are the best around.
feed me now i love you
"Great stuff. Grew up near little Italy on the South Side, and it's a little bit of home for me. I wish they had ��a liqueur license...I miss my Drambuie and coffee after my meal. I'll go back for more for sure."
"I don't know how to explain the feeling I've had twice after indulging in Cafe 28's pork dinners. ��The short of it - I had to get up from the table to step outside for a breather, because the flavors were so wonderfully intense. ��And married with the intoxicating aromas and perhaps more intoxicating caipirinhas, it was all too fantastic to stay seated. ��The other mentionable -- for some reason, my husband and I always have life-changing conversations at Cafe 28. ��It's surprising to me, because the atmosphere is not one I would describe as overly romantic, but there's something in the air, perhaps, that just works for us.Cafe 28 is a gem."
"I ordered a Superman cake to be delivered today, Monday, April 4th from Alliance Bakery. ��I live in Southern Illinois and ordered the cake for a friend in Chicago. ��I must say the cake was PERFECT, and my friend could not have been more thrilled. ��Alliance Bakery made his birthday extra special! ��From the person who answered the phone, to the person that helped me come up with an idea for the cake, I had superb service. ��I will without a doubt use this bakery again in the future for my cake-loving friend and hope to someday soon visit Alliance Bakery in person."
"Wing heaven, Everyone i have introduced to these wings are hooked. I know the owner from when i used to work down the street from his burger joint. ��I love these wings, i could eat them everyday if i could afford it. the steak and rice bowl is also real good. I havent tried much else because there is no need to!"
"This very quant little place is great, especially on the weekdays when there are less people. The food is fantastic, offering a large quantity of fresh food at a very decent price. The Eggs Benedict is said to be the best in the city there, and it is by far the best that I have had. The kitchen is open to view and the cooks are working hard, putting food up quickly. The owner of the place is usually working the window in the kitchen on the weekends making sure the food is out quick. The tables are turned rather quickly and every wait seems pretty short and always worth it!CleanGreat foodDiverse menuQuick to turn tablesWell pricedHuge portionsBYO"
"Maybe my review is biased and I will say that it was not my first choice to dine here...it was my husbands. On our visit, the service was lacking. The men carrying meat walked by and seemed not to notice us even when my husband had his card flipped over the right way. I appreciate that they were accommodating for my vegetarian diet, but the salad bar seemed a bit over priced considering the options and the mediocre (at best) food."
"I live right down the street from this restaurant and am so happy to have such a great find in the neighborhood! ��I have now been to Chicago Q twice, and both experiences were fantastic. ��Not only was the food great, but the atmosphere was comfortable and the service was unbelievable. ��One server in particular, Alfredo, made our experience absolutely wonderful - I cannot say enough about him. ��I will definitely go back and recommend this restaurant to my friends and family."
To die for authentic mexican food! super crowded on the weekends!
"Can I really not give it 5?All the givens of a place like this are givens: brilliant service, perfect aroma as well as aromatics, and impeccable food.From the myriad of sensations of the first bite of fish roe to the powdering of a new take on A-1 Sauce all the way to slurping bubble gum tapioca from a straw, there is not a clunker in the menu. ��The experience is all you would expect and wish for, guaranteed. ��As for the boring, but all-important detail: I opted for the 12-course tasting, and it was plenty.I have nothing left to say. ��It really is a woohoo!"
"Well, gotta play I was there before it was cool for a moment...Went in there about 10 (!) years ago, when the daytime bartender was Shirley who was about 70+ and moved about as slow as molasses in January but was the greatest bartender around there. We got pulled in by the jukebox that played almost scratch-free 45s for a dime (!). I mean, Archie Bell and the Drells doing Tighten Up?? C'mon! No back dining room then, two tiny rest rooms (mens and womens) on the main floor where the one is now (where you could hear EVERYTHING from the bar...ahem), and a few of the leftover patrons from when the bar was a hillbilly haven. But Michael and Louise turned it into a great bar with the best beer selection I had ever seen at that point in my drinking life. They had a TV in the corner of the back wa"
"One word, RUDE ! ?And that's before we even crossed the threshold.My husband received a call from the restaurant ?at 7pm Friday inquiring if we were supposed to be at the restaurant at that moment. ?We hade made reservations for the next day, Saturday, at least so we thought. ?Some less than polite discourse took place. ?My husband asked if they could maybe accommodate us on Saturday even though we knew it was unlikely as their space is small. ?He hung up the phone. ?The phone rang and it was Schwa. ?Conversation ended with F@#% ! coming from the Schwa end of the phone and a click.Not sure what exactly transpired between my husband and Schwa from reservation to confirmation to the rude discourse on the night of the missed reservation. ?Everyone in our party knew the reservation was for the"
"Oh man...get ready for this people. I've done the Tasting menu (12 courses) once and the Tour menu (yesterday was 29 courses! Took 5 hrs!!!) twice. It's SOOO expensive but worth every penny. The quality of food is out of this world and the way everything is presented to you is nothing short of innovative and simply amazing. The chef can be classified more as a chemist than anything. The way flavors are mixed and presented you is a journey all on it's own. The best meal you will ever have, gauranteed."
"I have dined at some of the best restaurants around the world, this was my second trip to Bonsoiree in less than a week and simply said, they have been two of my most pleasurable dining experiences ever. From gaining a friend couple who were seated at the table next to us on our first trip for celebration of my 50th birthday to my awe at the consistencies of the service and the unbelievably delectable courses, this restaurant is truly a keeper of the grand tradition of fine dining. Move over boys Chef Shin Thompson is the real deal. The concept of the restaurant in Logan Square is BYOB which I warmly embrace. Having friends who take wine as seriously as I take food allows for a great variation and new discovery with each dining experience at Bonsoiree, each new wine pairing brings a new fi"
"Went their last night and had a great time. Good food, great service, and love the atmosphere! ��Make sure to try the honey wine, it is delicious."
"The food is fantastic and our waiter was great. There isn't much more to say about this place than that. I suggest if you are going to wait, put your name on the list and head over to the bar or if you don't want to wait come late on a weekday and grab a seat at the bar! If they took reservations I would give this place the extra star!"
"The Taste Buds, three young restaurant reviewers, loved Sun Wah, especially the duck and the crispy noodles. The full review can be found on Chicago Now, http://www.chicagonow.co��_."
One of the best pizza establishment in Chicago.Chicago's well known deep dish pizza! Just make sure that you do a lot of excercise after you eat.Great food.
"By far one of the BEST places to eat in the city. ��Not only is the food superb (Best Italian beef I've ever had), but they also make great coffee and alcoholic drinks.Some of my must have items on the menu:-Diablo's Beef-Diablo's Tacos-Chinese Noodle Soup-Cajun Chicken Penne-Stuffed French Toast-Lynchberg Lemonade -Chai Tea Latte-Hot ChocolateNot to mention some of the best coffee and service."
"YUM!My husband and I wanted to go someplace nice that we had never been to before for a date night. We picked Big Jones and it was the right decision for sure!Some highlights:--knowledgeable, attentive server who was informative but not overbearing--delicious onion pie appetizer!--my husband had the quail gumbo special for dinner and literally licked the plate because it was so good. i was kind of a dork and ordered the hamburger but it was DELICIOUS.--beautiful atmosphere and decorations Would definitely go back. Can't wait to try their brunch!"
"I'll start by saying that Thai food is my favorite quisine. Opart thai is a staple restaurant for us. ��We used to try different neighborhood thai restaurants and were always disappointed. This is by far one of, if not the best one ��that we've every tried.The wait staff is always friendly (many know us by name), service is quick and accurate.There are many spicy dishes, but they will adjust spice (heat) level to ��suit you. Have tried almost everything on menu over the years and have never been unhappy.Of course, who doesn't like a good BYOB? There is a liquor store right next door in case you forget or need more! �� They can get very busy, but I've never been made to feel rushed to leave. We drive to Opart, but it seems that it would be easy to get to by using public transportation. El stop "
"Saturday, August 30, 2008Review of terribly rude service from Calo Ristorante located in Chicago's Andersonville neighborhood. My partner and I have patronized Calo Ristorante on many occasions. Calo Ristorante in my opinion has flavorful Italian cuisine at a reasonable price with mediocre service. However, on this particular occasion the managers' service skills were not present. My partner and I were viewing the menu posted out side of the restaurant before entering. The manager was walking into the restaurant and proceeded to hold the door open for a female patron and let the door swing shut behind him knowingly aware that my partner and I were directly behind him. We proceeded to open the door and walk in to the restaurant to be seated. The manager pretended not to notice that he had j"
"I'm only rating one thing here- The croissants. Alliance bakery makes some of the freshest, flakiest croissants in the city. I'm not sure about everything else there, but if you need a killer petit pain with your coffee, this is the place to visit in the area. Other than that, I say service is mixed from amazing to arrogant to unresponsive and sometimes the sitting area is kind of dirty/smelly."
"Ok, where should I start? ?First of all, my boss just took us to this place today for lunch. ?She says it's one of her favorite restaurants. ?So, I come to Yelp to read reviews and most of them are pretty good...most....here's my take on this place:The saganaki or flaming cheese was SO SALTY...oh my goodness! ?I ate it, because it's CHEESE, but it was so salty...I'd probably never order it again simply because of that.I agree with most on here who says the food seems like it was sitting around for a while...I ordered the seafood kabob and the shrimp were hard as rocks...I mean they were TOUGH! ?The entire kabob was really bland, so needless to say, I really didn't enjoy eating it. ?The salmon was cold and chewy...I KNOW that kabob was sitting out..you could tell by the texture and temperat"
By far the best quality of fish I have ever tasted. I have been to plenty of sushi restaurants both in Chicago and in other cities and the quality of fish was amazing. We were with a big group and order additional plates like the black cod and sea bass. Both were like butter. I highly recommend going to Sunda.
"I'm afraid to post that this place is so great because I'd hate to go and find it too busy to get a seat, but this place is truly amazing! ��My boyfriend and I always try something new and we've yet to find something we didn't like. ��We order the Grilled Lemongrass Beef appetizer almost everytime because it's my fave and fun to get to make it ourselves. ��Simply beef is so tender and delicious. ��Prices are great, staff is friendly & so happy to have our business, and best part is they serve free fresh fruit for dessert!"
"I love to have a strawberry/banana/pineapple smoothie while waiting for my very generous veggie burger. ..Waitstaff usually great...sometimes you have to wait a little longer than expected...but, worth it. �� Brought my husbands 92 year old grandparents here before heading to Dinkel's Bakery, and our server was wonderful! She listened to them and hugged them at the end of the meal while exclaiming how wonderful they had been. ��Its good to know great places really do exist with people who really do care."
"Delicious food, high quality, great sushi. Amazing prices!! Great atmosphere. Staff is not friendly but you get your food."
"One of my favorite restaurants. ��The food is delicious, they have a great location, and I love getting one of the seats that overlooks Michigan Avenue. ��They have wonderful salads, and great sandwiches/burgers. ��But my favorite since I'm obsessed with chocolate as you can tell from my reviews is their molten chocolate cake. ��It takes some extra time to make so we usually order it with our lunch or dinner, and then it is sooooo good. ��YUM."
"A friend and I found ourselves at Carnivale by way of recommendation after another well-championed option ended up being closed down *yikes* so, we didn't know what to expect. Boy were we plesantly surprised! This former niteclub turned eccletic and bright eatery was huge and a delight to all senses. Make sure u see Luis (proud Mexican bartender who makes a mean rasberry mojito) and Quade well versed server who had a great story about how he got his name. The ropa vieja is a tastebud pleaser and the brownie ice cream sundae won't disappoint (tho beware, the extra scoop of ice cream will cost u 4 bucks). Nevertheless, we'll be back... with plenty of friends!"
"Great menu with even better cocktails. Atmosphere is superb unless you happen to be stuck getting sat next to the band that they occasionally have. Service is terrific, outdoor seating is nice in the summer."
"Watch out for the salt. ��Having lived in china for four years, I was very excited to try this restaurant. I ordered take-out: ma po tofu and szechuan green beans.The ingredients and presentation were perfect, but the chef was way too heavy handed with the salt. �� I literally could not eat my meal. �� I rinsed everything and started over. �� And i'm a salt person. ��I hope the chef sees this and reconsiders his liberal application of seasoning."
"This the best breakfast spot in the Bridgeport. ��It's a little pricey, but the food is worth it."
On my last day in Chicago i will eat the following at M&H:Granola for breakfast and crab cake sandwich for lunch! (probably)
"I am not an Indian so could not judge authenticity. In my view India House is the best Indian restaurant outside of Devon Avenue. I came a few times for lunch. Their buffett ��is superb! I've have tried many different dishes: meet, veggie, fish. I enjoyed everything very much. I am a big fan of Indian sweets, but event they are quite enjoyable at india House."
"I've been coming here since the early 80's with my parents. It's still as fun and delicious. They have great drinks, awesome burgers, wraps, soups & salads. Oh and that salad bar...well, they were the first that I can remember. Anyway, another great example of a small place that executes well towards their customers. I bring all my friends who visit from out of state or the country. Can't beat the food and drinks at this place. Continued success to you guys!!!"
" The most romantic cafe - not for my taste. They've tried their best, therefore the 5 stars. It is a small place, smells like grease and there is no oxygen to breathe- my eyes were swollen and itchy ?after 1 hour spent in there. The food is expensive. I would recommend to try it ?just once- it is an interesting experience."
"This restaurant was recommended by a staff member of the hotel where we stayed and is a great breakfast spot. ��Food was very good, menu extensive and service was fast and friendly. ��We'll definitely be back when we're in the neighborhood!"
"I love this place! It's my destination every time I'm in the mode for a great time. Drinks are unbelievable, and the food is great every time! ��My highest recommendation."
Speechless!
"This place is Great, The Food is excellent, Real authentic Greek Restaurant."
Quack Quack. Duck Duck. Yum Yum. OMG the duck was so crispy and yummy. The preices were real cheap too. We shared a whole duck and still took some home. The sauces were really tasty also. The servers were ok not bad
"Wow, what a huge disappointment after reading so many positive reviews. ��We really can't figure it out why so many positive reviews unless someone from the restaurant or friends are constantly updating reviews. ��I personally travel the world and I am always seeking my next dining adventure. ��I have never posted a review because I have never been so disappointed in a selection based on reviews.We dined at TRU, if you want to call it that, on May 15, 2010. ��It was to celebrate an Opera performance competition earlier in the day. ��We had traveled from Dallas and wanted to eat at what we thought was the top restaurant in Chicago, but we could not have made a poorer decision. ��I think people are caught up in the ambiance and service and not the food. ��I want food to explode in flavor in my mout"
Love yankee scrambled eggs. The waiting line there on Sundays is long but goes quickly. Didn't like pancakes too much.
"For almost one year my husband and I walked by the place before stepping inside. ��It didn't look too enticing from the outside with the busstop right outside the door. ��Then we walked in and have been back about 6 times since. ��With all the other choices in Andersonville, that is sayng something. We've taken others there, they all agree it's pretty good stuff. ��Our favorite soup is the complimentary vegetable puree, which one can heat up depending on how much additional mystery paste is added. ��Then there are the entrees. ��We usually eat mid afternoon, so we usually order the savory crepes. ��My all time favorite is the house Icosium crepe, but the Chicago crepe is a solid runner up. ��Their apricot iced tea is really good, but sometimes a little weaker than others. ��The cucumber water is a "
"I WANT THIS PLACE TO BE BETTER.But it's not. My mom's side is from the South. SO I know good Southern food when it's put in front of me.I am always excited and enticed by the food and menu; but when it arrives I am always underwhelmed. My last experience was the jambalaya. It was nothing close to real down south Louisiana goodness. It's like they take Southern food and make it smarter so Midwesterners can eat it. It's not all bad.......My Maw maw and Wishbone must have the exact same cheese grits recipe!! In a pinch for some down home? Try it out. When I need my grit fix, I do it at WISHBONE."
"We reserved a table at Shaw's for New Year's Eve. My husband and I love seafood and, after viewing the menu online, decided it looked like a good place. Wrong! First, the tables are way too close together. It was pretty annoying to constantly be looking at a waiter's butt as they tended to the table next to us. Further, the people at the next table (about 3 feet away) arrived drunk, continued to be served alcohol, and proceeded to have a loud conversation about what they would like to do to each other in bed. They also enjoyed slurp-filled make out sessions. It was disgusting. Second, the food was unremarkable. My husband thought his dish was okay, but I did not like mine at all. I had crab stuffed fish, which was really just a small piece of fish with some crab cake lumped on top. The cra"
"I used to like this store, the location is perfect, and the hours are perfect 6-midnight, you could get fresh bread at any time... but no, no more!! the WORST customer service and the WORST management at the MOST EXPENSIVE store in Chicago. (Even Whole Foods beats them with prices!)**One note: the people at the meat counter are always super friendly and I will miss them, for I am not returning to this store ever again.I am one of those people who likes local grocery stores, likes fancy things, and I don't mind paying extra if the experience is good. But, FOX&OBEL IS SOO OVER.There is a film (?) being shot there tonight. I could not get bread. I was not greeted by anyone, I was shuffled around the store like an extra. Nobody explained what is going on, or how long I have to wait to buy some"
Sushi is pretty good . . . nothing special though; However the imported wasabi is excellent; The crowd is a bit annoying
"This is terrible!How do you take that star back?!Delivery service is lax!I ordered one medium deep dish pizza for delivery next door to the hospital and from the start I knew I should have not even ordered. It took the person who answered the phone 15 min just to figure out how to spell my name and figure out that I was next door. My name has 8 letters 4 in the first and 4 in the last, not hard at all. When I ordered my one medium deep dish pizza they estimated my time at 1 hr and 15 min! Rediculous. Even worse it showed up a half hr after that and when I finally got it, it look like grease soup and tasted just the same. Oh and it came out to 30 bucks because their prices are ""so reasonable"". When I called I did get a different comped order but I had to make it up because the nonlinear men"
"For the amount of press this place gets, I am not sure what the fuss is all about. I found the food to be mediocre despite the somewhat pretentious way it's presented by the waitstaff. We started with the bone marrow for an appetizer and shared the special (roasted chicken with truffles, for 2), scallops with oxtail gnocchi, and something else that I cannot recall. The bone marrow was a new experience for me and I wasn't really digging it just from a pure textural perspective (admittedly, I don't like the concept of chewing on fatty tissue, though the onion jam should be on everything). The oxtail gnocchi was very good but it was more of an enhancement to the scallops (which I didn't care for because I'm not that big of a seafood eater), and the chicken was average. Given the long wait tim"
"My husband and I have had a couple of our best meals ever at L&E. Delicious cocktails and outstanding food that suits both my vegetarian-leaning and his meat-adoring tastes. ��A real value for the quality of the experience. ��The staff has always been very helpful and friendly. ��People need to forget about trying to measure it on the hipster-meter; just go there to enjoy some excellent food and drink, and you will not be disappointed."
The food - the margaritas - the wait staff - everything about this place rocks! ��Highly recommend the pineapple margarita!
"Found Glen[s Diner on Diners Drive-ins, & Dives, and I have been at least 5 times now! The black board selection of seafood is always overwhelming because there are so many great choices and I love that they are constantly making changes to the menu to keep it exciting. I've had tuna, salmon, swordfish and tilapia here ( with awesome glazes, crusts etc) and am always satisfied. They also have a to DIE for appetizer- the shrimp cargo- which is basically 5 pieces of shrimp drowning in butter and cheese that you eat with garlic bread. Do it. Trust me."
"Went from reviews of your steakhouse edition. I'm no longer a beefeater, but took 2 guests on Weds. night. It was wonderful-can't say enough about the service or food. Price was reasonable-service was great-fruit drionks were superb!"
"My first fondue experience was at Geja's Cafe in Lincoln Park. This place was definitely intimate and romantic. Almost ALL couples were there, including my boyfriend and myself out for our anniversary.This place is clearly geared for romance..soft music played by a violinist..dimly lit candles..small, intimate tables. Though the atmosphere was dreamy, the food was...eh. In essence you get a plate of raw veggies and meat that you skewer & fry ��in oil. And at $50+ bucks a pop..well, I wouldn't say this would be a regular joint for me. Save this place for the rare special occasion, or skip it for better food elsewhere. Chicago has too many awesome restaraunts with amazing food to waste so much $$ on a mediocre dinner. (though a romantic experience)I know my boyfriend would have much preferred"
"I liked Sunda very much. ��This type of restaurant is why I love Chicago, unprententious, yet popular and chic. ��Good food, good atmosphere, a little pricey, but the service was worth it. ��Nice place, good people."
"very disappointed! ��a bunch of us went - enjoying the day in chicago! �� line was pretty long but we got in prob. 20 mins (which was a shock) - were up on the 3rd floor - ��waitress (ashley) came over got our drinks & ��appetizers order - all going good! ��they came pretty good time, all good - ordered pizzas & more drinks - pitchers of beer - (+ a chicken strip dinner & i reminded them, like not to forget) ��well, well, well, we were damn thirsty - hot out & walking around all day - & no beer yet - we waited prob 20 mins + �� so 2 of our group decided to go up to beverage station & try to get some & the people were very rude & said sit down someone would be with us - well ashley never came back, we saw her running around, but i guess she forgot about us - but a very nice gentleman - joshua - wa"
"Their service is declining over time although still popular. Food is definitely not good compared with NYC and west coast. Service is sometimes arrogant, esp. when busy."
"I took a friend here yesterday and really enjoyed it. The beer selection was good, though my 312 was a bit warm but the second one was a normal temp. I had the steak and my friend had the salmon, my steak was well cooked perfectly seasoned, I didn't care for the spinach however but that was a personal preference. The wait staff was extremely attentive and always had a smile, great place!"
"Service is so so, but good food!"
"very much a touristy deep-dish sensation. although it is good they have certainly become a franchise and have gone off what made them so great. however, I still enjoy a deep dish Giordano's pizza for old times sake. usually with the family because they find it acceptable to wait such a long time to be seated. I usually bypass this and get a better pizza. But i am a good grandpa."
Best pizza in Chicago for me .I had Chicken wings BBQ flavor only.Side Salad could of been better.I had a mix of the meat and the special recipe deep dish. The best pizza in Chicago. If you dont want to wait 30 minutes for a personal pie then you can order from what they have in their warmer that are ready.
"I have had many lovely meals at Anteprima---a wonderful spot for special occasions of any kind. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly and the food is unique and always delicious. They always highlight fresh ingredients and have an interesting specials roster every day. From the homey and intimate decor to the menu where every item is a good choice, this is one restaurant that never disappoints."
Mastros is great. ��I've been here quite a few times. ��It has a great interior decor and has a marvelous bar with live music. ��It's definitely a great place to meet your friends. ��I visited Mastros this evening with my friends. ��We all had steaks and they were cooked perfectly! ��I can tell you that this place is all about service. ��Our waiter was 'on the spot'. ��He was very attentive and nothing was missed and this made for a very easy evening. ��Get the butter cake!
Only come here if your hungry the place is huge and the service was great this would NOT be a great place for light eaters and vegetarians they give you many different meats but it was worth it the only reason I did not give it the full 5 stars was the price which is expensive
I have been to many Indian restaurants and I have to say this is one of the best! Try them out and see for yourself!
"Terrible food, even worse service, crowded and overpriced. I will never go back."
"I made a reservation for May 24 a month in advance. ?When I made the reservation, I made a special request to be seated in the main dining room (not on the patio). ?On Monday May 23, I called to confirm my reservation and reminded them that I requested seating in the main dining room. ?They confirmed they have noted my request. ?When I arrived there was no seating in the main dining room. ?They stuck me in a small crowded room that was SO LOUD, my in town guests and I were unable to have a conversation. ?I am done with Piccolo Sogno."
"Me and my wife went last night for the first time to Little Bucharest Bistro.Before ordering, the waitress talked to us a little bit and asked a few questions, giving me the impression that she was doing so to know our nationality and that way figure out which menu to give us? It was really confusing, she had like 5 different menus. I bet this was difficult for her since I am latin and my wife Italian. Apparently they have a menu for russians, romanians and other type of nationalities, could this be considered racism? Kind of reminded me when black people weren't allowed in 'white people' restaurants.The host (owner, we think) was very friendly, maybe a little too friendly ...to the point where we didn't know if we had better offer him a chair to sit with us since he liked to talk to us ev"
"Love the Gage.Close to everything downtown. ��I have always just walked in (evenon weekends) and was seated. ��Food is good, staff are good -- fair prices."
"Big Jones is delicious, inventive, and �_ber friendly. It's our go-to restaurant for taking visiting friends and family or if my family just feels like grabbing brunch. Our service has always been spectacular and the food is always at once both inspiring and comforting. I'm so happy that we live a few blocks from Big Jones and are only a few minutes away from one of the very best restaurants in Chicago. If you haven't already tried it, I demand you go now! You won't be disappointed!"
good pizza with a nice crispy crust. Delivery is hit or miss sometimes its piping hor othertimes on the cold side of warm. fortuneatly I like cold Pizza & it is great when cold here
"Seriously cheap. ��Seriously Mexican food in west Pilsen. ��You can't get that much more authentic. ��Case in point because lots of locals eat here...that means its good. ��Bring in your own drinks. ��Get free chips and 3 different kinds of salsa. ��Order any number of typical Mexican dishes...highly recommend the combinacion or tacos or tamales or enchis or whatever you want. ��Pay less than $10. ��Also, the waitresses wear traditional Mexican Indian countryside garb which is amazing. ��Order in Spanish is preferable."
"Truly, I would give Sprout 4.5 stars. I just went for a birthday dinner date on Saturday and had a fantastic experience! The atmosphere is romantic, modern, simple, warmly-lit, and most of all, completely unpretentious. And that's the theme running through this restaurant. It's chic. It's beautiful. But the food does the talking. You may show up in a nice jeans outfit, or you may go all out in dressy attire. No one need feel they must dress to the nines. That is by no means to say that it is easy on the wallet or not an upscale establishment. The pricing is going to run about $100 per person by the end of the evening (if you go for the 3 course prix fixe, have drinks, plus tip). You may order items a la carte, but I feel that if you're going to visit Sprout, you may as well do it up and en"
The absolute Mecca for all Foodies visiting Chicago- ��Encased Meat Heaven- Duck Fat Fries- I couldnt wipe the smile off my face for hours afterwards...A Must Have Experience...having Doug himself personally take your order- starstruck ;)
"Love this place. ��Love the burgers, salad bar, and deserts. ��Just watch out for the wait."
"Decent food but really over priced for what you are getting. ?The worst part about my meal here was that we were sat in the back by the kitchen and where (I assume) the servers hang out because all I heard were people yelling in the back, dropping dishes and at one point (I am NOT making this up) I heard someone yell out a description of his bang last night.For a place that is on Michigan Ave, it should be better managed. ?Take a look around for your servers hiding themselves in the back because once I heard that, I got up and walked to the front where I found my server standing there watching tv and thanked him for the horrible time.And to top it all off, he smirked and said, Any time Sir. ?If that isn't snotty service downtown, I don't know what is.This is why I eat at laid back places w"
"Ok if you like fried, creamy seafood this place is for you. I could not believe how awful the seafood selection was. Pan fried everything with Alfredo this and that. Come on. I figured they must have to hide the last of the fish with all the spicy hollondaise. I was very unimpressed and the service at night was just nothing compared to the morning breakfast diner that this place should develop and drop the seafood wanna be place."
"The atmosphere is very nice, and the people are wonderful. ��I ordered catering for my school, and the restaurant did everything to accommodate us. ��The food was delicious, and they gave us a very good deal. ��The people we served in my school loved the food."
"Scrumptious, cheap, great staff - what more is there in life! ��Simply fabulous - great spicy salsas, tamarindo soda and the steak, rib eye super burrito is a meal for two. ��Tacos are also great. ��It might be a dive, but don't judge by the look - just go - just fabulous!"
"Visited pevious location and think its as good as ever. Great place to get a variety of tastes and will work if you have ��family that likes varying degrees of heat. Have stopped often while in Chinatown and always like to try something different. Would lik to get a little more adventurous wih some items, but will get there. Have recommended to people in for conventions and they love its close y and not the typical fare they have when in Chicago."
"Not only was this the best steak I've had in Chicago, it was the best halibut I've had as well. One normally doesn't go to a chophouse for seafood, but it is great to know that the options at Kinzie's are not limited to beef! Both fish and meat were seared and spiced to perfection, extremely flavorful and moist, and were complemented by the freshest ingredients. Our server, Servando, was a super helpful character with a great sense of humor. He brought out a meat tray for us to see the cuts of meat before choosing from the 13 steak options. To top it off, the dessert was outstanding - the creme brul��e was superb and chocolate terrine rich and light. The ambiance is certainly elegant, yet unpretentious. I cannot recommend this place enough!"
"This was my fourth and final visit to Spacca Napoli. ?Two visits ago, I was dining with a friend at a two-top. ?After our plates were cleared, Jonathan Goldsmith (the owner) came up to us and asked if we would mind moving to another table as he was trying to set up for a party of eight. ?He offered us each a grappa and apologized for the inconvenience. ?We obliged without question. ?Last night I was dining with 3 friends at a four-top. ?We had reservations and were seated promptly. ?After completing our meals (including dessert), our waiter offered us the check. ?At that time, we had been at our table for a little over an hour. ?In the middle of our conversation, Jonathan Goldsmith came to our table and asked if he could settle our bill, to which I replied, No, we haven't looked at it yet."
My favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. ��Simply delicious and GREAT margaritas too.
"Awesome menu... lots of variety. ��Very long wait, but worth it.Variety is the spice of life. ��I love this place!"
"Terrible service- manager is rude. ��We waited 2 hours for our pizza and then told the waitress we needed our pizza boxed b/c we were taking our friends to the train. ��The waitress told us it will be ready in 5 min- 20 min later there was no pizza. ��At this point we could not wait any longer and had to leave to drop our friends off at the train and told the manager we would call him. ��Ten minutes later we called and the manager was very rude; 2.5 hours had passed and we were very hungry and said we were on our way back to pick the pizza up. ��The manager then said he gave the pizza away and voided our credit card. ��He did not offer any concessions for our time, ��sympothy or apologize."
"Excellent breakfast! I'll make this short but sweet, phenomenal food and honest price. They have their own unique dishes, and the little things like coffee and juices were exceptional. Please check it out you will not be disappointed!"
"Friends recently had a party where more than a dozen people got food poisoning from their beef stew. ��The public health department found more than 10 violations, 2 critical in their kitchen and were cited and later fined. (11/19/2007 Citation #H00003642715) ��A follow up showed some violations remained but were eventually cleaned up.The worst part about it is that the owners showed little regard for the adults and children who got sick that day. ��Many of our families have a long tradition of going to Nuevo Leon but not any more. Their behavior is unexcusable."
"Absolutely wonderful. Sat outdoors, a bit pricey, but not for this neighborhood. Stand outs included whole fish, satay filet, shrimp on sugar cane, steamed chicken dumplings in fish sauce. Go with servers recommendations."
I miss this place the most since I moved out of the country :( Loved the shakes and the hotdogs. I remember it being a bit pricey but totally worth it.
"So, what this place has really going for them is that its the most charming and romantic eatery in all of aville/edgeh20. The food too is good, not great. The tuna bruschetta appetizer was a bit on the fishy side but the ravioli was excellent although not hearty enough. They do have a fabulous wine list though and what looks ��to be a great outdoor patio. Service was acceptable but not as polished as I'd expect from a place with this price point."
"This place is the best deal in Lincon Park. ��The food is fantastic, the service is friendly, and location convenient! ��I go here all the time when I'm craving a great falaffel sandwich!"
"Great new place on Taylor. Inexpensive but good wine. Pizza is amazing (if you like authentic Italian pizza). The sea urchin pasta was fantastic. The atmosphere is young, loud and energetic. Older folks not into the scene might be better off at Francescas across the street."
"3 friends and I had dinner at Bin 36 last night. We had an enjoyable evening up until the last 10 minutes of our meal. After spending over $300 on appetizers, wine flights and entrees my friend asked if she could take home a few of the complimentary breadsticks for her husband. The waiter said sure, ""for $1 a breadstick."" Surely he's joking we thought. She asked for 20 breadsticks and sure enough there was a $20 charge for breadsticks. We paid the bill and on the way out I explained to the manager how angry we were about being nickel and dimed over COMPLIMENTARY breadsticks after spending over $300 on dinner. She apologized for the confusion and offered to return the $20. We said that would be fine and when she handed my friend her money back she took the breadsticks back!!! WHAT!?! We wer"
"Food: ?Fantastic. ?Excellent naan and dipping sauce, piping hot tandoori chicken (still sizzling on the skillet when it is brought to the table), spicy crab curry, and flavorful lentils. ?Everything was delicious. ?With over 200 items on the menu, there should be something for everyone. ?Atmosphere/Service: ?A large waitstaff created a bustling, but not overbearing, atmosphere. ? All of our needs and requests were graciously met and usually anticipated. ?The service and atmosphere enhanced the overall dining experience and were simultaneously upscale and relaxed.Price: Somewhat pricey, especially for the sides. ?Rice is not included with most dinners. ?An order of rice is $5; a half order of lentils runs almost $7. ?However, baby naan is brought to your table when you arrive (and is replac"
"When discussing brazilian steak houses in Chicago, this is the best. Their meat is better quality then the others and they are the only one that is actually from Chicago and not a chain. I especially love the incredible service here and the rotation of the meats they serve."
"It was quirky and interesting- a very casual atmosphere with playful but sophisticated food. The combinations were original. I felt overall it was a little contrived, my salad for instance was presented in wedges which looked great but actually left solid parts of lettuce undressed which I didn't care for. My colleague ordered a dish which sounded like a baked potato but was actually a soup with the same flavors. I think it would be a very fun place to go with a date, but it was not exactly right for the business dinner I needed."
"Best best Brazilian steakhouse. Everything here is very delicious! The servers were great, and so was the atmosphere. Highly recommended!"
"I went with a group of friends to Yolk on a recent Sunday morning, only to be told the wait would be an hour. ��We weren't thrilled, but decided to wait anyway (happily enjoying the gorgeous weather outside). ��Surprisingly, Yolk was worth the wait. ��The food was deelish, the service was awesome, and the price was right. ��I'd **totally** go back again."
"I always enjoy a good cuban sandwich and this is my new favorite spot. I sat outside in the outdoor patio last week and enjoyed a great meal. The staff was very friendly and most important my sandwich tasted great!My one complaint, soda was served in a can. I won't knock any stars off because of it, but I wish they had fountain soda instead!I highly recommend this restaurant."
"this place is consistently good, friendly and reasonably priced. ��The pepito sandwich is the best as well as the fried yucca....garlically delicious!"
First off Kudos to Josh the host. We had made reservations for 7 but there was a possibility of it only being 5 maybe 6. Josh went ahead and gave us a 6 top which we ended up needing. The place was packed at 7 on a sautrday night so it was loud inside and I will have to go back to sit out in the patio area b/c it looked so nice out there. ��Bacon wrapped dates so tender and not overly salty like I have had before.The Ropa something or other was good but I should have gone with something a little more flavorful.Everyone at the table said there food was good and the baked goat cheese was very popular. ��Our server was a little lacking she didn't even introduce her self and the expo/ bus team was seen more than her.
Thank you Michael and Brandon for great service and cake too. Delicious! My neice loved it!
"Good food. Fun place to go. I don't get there as often as I want, but every time I go I am happy."
"NOT WORTH THE PATIO! After returning for a second time to experience the ever talked about patio I was extremely disappointed. ��Not only was I seated one hour after my reservation time, multiple parties who arrived well after I did were seated before my table. ��This is clearly a place where if you don't know someone expect to be ignored. ��Our waiter was extremely rude, acting annoyed when he made the frustrating mistake of bringing a glass of wine instead of the bottle I clearly ordered. ��The cold, unfriendly service made me feel very unwelcome and contributed to the overall negative experience we had. ��The food is absolutely forgettable- the peaches in my antipasti were rock hard and tasteless (when there is so much great produce in the summer it shouldn't be so hard to create a good dish"
"Used to be a HUGE fan of Wildfire, but the last two times I ate there the salad dressing was sour. �� I even bought a bottle to take home when it was opened, the salad dressing was sour, it was returned and we received a second bottle, got it home opened it up and it was SOUR. ��You can have your Wildfire ��eeeeeccckkkk."
"We have been here numerous times-food great every time. ��Won't go back though. ��We had a 7:30 Saturday night reservation which we changed to 6:15 late that afternoon. ��We arrived at 6:25 and our table was given away. ��Place was empty and the host said the best he could do was fit us in at 8:30. ��We were clearly frustrated and it was obvious the host did not really care. ��First, he should not have given away our reservation so quickly. ��Second, he could have attempted to squeeze us in sooner. ��This could have been handled better in a variety of ways. ��Restaurant owners need to have experienced managers working the front dealing with customers if they want to stick it out in the long run. ��Sent a complaint note to restaurant following day and no one even responded."
"The space is nice, service very quick, staff friendly. But this was definitely only an ok place for me. The biggest issue is the food. When you advertise as a bbq place, I expect, rightly or wrongly, legitimate bbq. I had the appetizer flight with the pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket and was pretty disappointed. As others have commented before, the chips they give you to start are too dry and seasoned incorrectly and somewhat gross but that's all there was to eat while waiting. The meat...well, it was dry and insufficiently pulled and then the brisket was just chunks of steak. The meat was an okay quality, but I expected brisket, not steak cut like I'm at chipotle or a small child. The meat hadn't been properly marinated, none of the juices or flavors were in the meat - it seemed li"
Great BYOB sushi bar. Staff was excellent and food was amazing. Busy after 5:30- get there early!
"I love Meli's and come here all the time during the week. ��I tried to go for weekend brunch once and the wait was so insane that I left--definitely easier getting a table during the week if you work nearby. ��The food is really fresh, fantastic quality (a lot of the produce is organic) and there is so much variety that there is something for everyone. ��i LOVE the potatoes that come with the egg dishes which is some sort of diced/smashed baby reds sauteed with onions: AWESOME! ��the house-made marmalades that they serve with toast are soooo good and always changing, and the fresh squeezed juices are delicious! ��i like that you can be healthy here and have an egg white omlette filled with veggies, or you can pig out on a monte cristo with fantastic french fries. ��Speaking of pigging out, I've "
"Service can be hit or miss, but the food is above par. ��Plus, they're open relatively late.Don't miss the desserts!"
"By far the best Hot Dog stand in Chicago. ��It's a misnomer to call them a Hot Dog stand because they have so many other items that are AMAZING! ��Whoopercheesie, SuperSteak and the SuperChickenMidgees are also my favorites! ��The Super Onion Chips are 100x better than any onion rings you will ever taste.GREAT hours! ��Open till at least 1AM EVERY NIGHT (even the weeknights!)Super friendly staff that always seem to be a great mood!"
"One of the greatest beer selections on Chicago's north side. ��Seriously, you can have as much fun trying the beer as you will trying to walk home after. ��And they're cheap! ��Okay, maybe not cheap, but they are well priced. ��So, beer good.Food good too! ��Actually, they have great food. ��I recommend starting with some appetizers because they are tasty, and you don't want to mess with your drinking schedule.Downside - the service. ��It can be slow, especially when they get crowded. ��And they do get crowded on the weekends. ��But get there earlyish and you'll get a table. ��After that, who cares, you're drinking beer!"
"I'm a huge fan of both Grand Luxe and Cheesecake Factory, but at Grand Luxe you never get sat ""cafeteria style"". ��You know, elbow to elbow with the strangers at the table next to you??? ��Anyhow, owned by the same folks, but Grand Luxe always seems to have a smidge more flavorful product which is weird. ��My TOP PICKS......the pineapple martini...OMG YUM!!!!!! The Chicken Picatta with extra capers and then to finish it off...the whit chocolate rasberry cheesecake. ��FABULOUS!!!!! ��Never had a bad meal or service there!!!"
"How can ANYONE like this place? It's SO pretentious there, and their food isn't even good! Not to mention it's also very dark. Maybe they turned down the lights so no one could see how much of a terrible job the chef was doing! I couldn't believe how overpriced everything was, considering how the sushi tasted bad and how our waitress treated us like we were the plague. Ugh. I have a bad taste in my mouth just thinking of them."
"If you ��are a fan of Indian food you will love this place , and if you are not a fan of Indian food you will be . They have a wide selection of food to choose from there really is something for everyone. Start ��with naan which is like ��or is a ��pita bread. You can dip it in the bowl of Tamarah ks shorba ( tomato soup with a splash of oh so good to it. ) The customer service oh so flattering very friendly, i like to come here at least once a month now. I am bringing my aunt here today I can't wait to show it off ! Food prices aren't that bad either you will like this place!"
Amazing MARGARITAS!! Just don't let them sit you in the back!
"Sabatino's is the bomb when it comes to good italian food. ��Been there a number of times now and have never been disappointed. ��Do yourself a favor if you go, eat half the meal and bring the rest home so you have room for dessert! ��The Banana Foster is awesome! ��Go as a couple or with a group either way you're going to enjoy yourself!"
"TRUly an amazing experience! We started with the caviar staircase and did the large tasting menu along with the wine pairing. Probably safe to say we won't be ordering caviar again anytime soon but still a fun, yet pricy, first experience. ��The 9 course tasting menu was unbelievable. It was by far the most adventurous meal we've eaten. The service was outstanding along with the ambiance. ��We will be back sooner than later."
"great sushi, but alittle too crowded on the weekends"
"The food was here was very good, I had the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe. The service was fantastic. The two hostesses, the bartenders, the server and busser gave some of the friendliest service I have experienced in a long time. Food 4 stars, service 5 stars."
"Great pizza! ��Usually only like a thicker crust, but this thinner crust was fresh, crisp, very good. ��had a white pizza with green pepper & artichokes, very good. ��atmosphere was chill, priced very reasonably... will be going back!"
"My husband took me here for my birthday and the food was delicious. ��We are not big eaters so we ordered the manchego cheese starter with honey and homemade cracker (per my request) and he loved it! ��We also ordered the braised beef with plaintains. A little salty but so good, we ordered another. ��We both had two drinks and our bill was only around $60! ��They brought out a cake and ice cream for my bday and not being a big chocolate cake fan - i loved it! ��Tasted more like a rum cake...mmmm. ��Our waitress was wonderful. We did express our diversion to cilantro and was not heard. Apparently they put it in everything. ��We attempted the shrimp ceviche but it was sprinkled all over after we asked to leave it out. ��They kindly took it off our bill. ��This always surprises me, since I know alot o"
"This place is one of the most inviting, foodie satisfying (everthing on the menu is grrrreat! ��Prices are reasonable and attention to detail for any occasion is superb. ��I ��have returned repeatedly with family and friends for the past 15 years."
This place has not let me down.....Ive bin here 6 total times and every time i have left extremely happy....I came here the other day with my cousin Jimmy and to my surprise during lunch the price is cut in half to 25 bucks a person....I can't stress enough how well seasoned there meat is and the salad bar is insane! I LOVE THIS PLACE!
"Visited this past Sat. with some friends. Crazy busy and loud, but pretty awesome! Great feel to the restaurant and the food was creative and delicious! We were told it would be a 45 min. wait but it ended up only taking 15! The hostess was unusually outgoing and welcoming for Chicago and the wait staff were quite attentive to our refills and questions. Overall, a great place for brunch!"
"This is my old time favorite. ��Great quality and very high quality tasty food. ��Le Colonial is always consistent in great customer service and excellent dishes.Grilled shrimp on sugar cane, tuna tartar, the macaroon and so much more. ��Excellent wine line.Whoever does not give this place a 5 star does not understand excellent food. �� Perfect all around."
"After our meal, we were presented with a check with prices higher than listed on the menu. The server pointed to a type written piece of paper taped to a condiment bottle that said, ""due to rising prices we are raising our prices from 25 cents to $2.00 per item, please bear with us until our new menus are printed."" Not wanting to cause a commotion I paid it since I was the host. Is this legal, there must a law against this? Increasing prices on a new menu is one thing, but adding a surcharge to every item is tacky and hopefully illegal. On top of this insult, the food was average, probably because they are now too busy and now more expensive. I suggest going to Chinatown South were the food is better and more reasonably priced. a former customer of Sun Wah"
"I went here on a Saturday night with 5 other friends and we had a really great time. The food and service were excellent, although I personally did not enjoy the swordfish. My favorite was actually the duck breast. The ambiance was also really nice and although we did not get to stay long, the rooftop lounge was a nice touch. The most impressive part for me was the fact that they provided a shuttle to and from our hotel, which saved us a ton on cab fare. Now I'm on a mission to find a place like this in Houston."
"In short, just because you have a solar panel, it doesn't give you an excuse to be a jerk.Went there for a friend's concert. Waited over 45 minutes to get a server's attention to order food (despite hand waiving, attempts at eye contact, etc.). When I pointed this out to the server, she rolled her eyes and stormed out. I had to excuse myself from the cramped table, asking a patron whom I didn't know to get out of his seat, so I could get up and calmly walk into the empty hallway to de-escelate the situation with the manager. And... my husband and I still ended up paying $35 for my evening cover and one drink each."
"This place is okay, albeit way out of the way from where I live. ��Their clam chowder and crab cakes are where its at. ��Sorry for the shortness of my review, I'm not a very colorful guy. ��What can I say. ��Go here!"
This place is pretty dang tasty and its fairly affordable. ��I went two weeks ago with three friends and we shared a few plates. ��Good times!
"Amazing food, great service....well worth the price!!"
"After 4 years of eating Chicago pizza, Giordano's is still my favorite. ��There's just something about the crust that makes me prefer it to the competitors. ��And I like going in and getting their individual specials for $6 - great deal!"
I love this place especially chicken thier kabab I go there at least once a month. and the meat is fresh and good quality
"Dont order lobster here. ?Salads and pastas off the hook. ?You ask who orders lobster at calos? well all i have to say that i was craving lobster so bad that night, that the menu only read lobster tail. ?Anyway. Calos has been around for years, it was nice to go back next time I wont being eating any seafood."
Encase meats!!!! MMMmmm enough said!!Well almost the variety there is outstanding and the specials keep me going again and again!!
"Great food, love the fast service, parking gets tricky around this area. ��thanks."
"The food was great, don't get me wrong. Discovering that the valets had stolen my brand new unopened air mattress and sheets out of the trunk while I was eating? Not so much. I highly recommend that if you go, you take all valuables out of your car before hand, because the food is great, and it's worth it if there is nothing worth more than 15$ in your car."
"Is there anything worse than someone trying so hard to be hip? I have read all the glowing reviews but must say my experience was truly bad. The hipper than thou attitude at the front desk was annoying; the seated at the bar as we are full when for the hour I was there there were several empty tables was just plain dumb management; the Caesar salad was good; the whitefish was edible; the salmon for my wife was not edible; we could not wait to get out of this overpriced, bad food, ridiculous attitude place. ��Our best experience of the night was the car valet who parked our car right in front but insisted on backing it up to the entry. ��Will never return; will always wonder why some people love it. ��chicago enjoys such wonderful neighborhood restaurants, why would anyone choose to be exploit"
"My wife and I tried this restaurant after seeing the chef on TV. ��We were greeted by the staff and the manager Jeff who were all extremely nice and courteous. ��We had the halibut and the walleye which were both fantastic. ��The only bad part of our evening was that we had an incredibly obnoxious and drunk woman next to us that would not stop talking to us and rambling about everything and anything. ��The waitress noticed this and Jeff came over and very nicely offered to buy them a drink to have out on their outdoor patio. ��He apologized to us and gave us a discount on the bill, all of which was unnecessary but entirely appreciated.We will definitely be back again."
"Thrilled that the owner of Pasteur decided to come into Lincoln Park with a smaller, affordable Vietnamese restaurant. ��Spring rolls, shrimp with fried yams appetizer is amazing. ��Chicken in claypot was alittle off, but we did like the seafood salad & my husband liked his. ��Our waiter didn't speak English very well, so if you need help with the menu, ask for Twuan, the super gracious owner, or someone else to steer you in the right direction. ��It's next to Victory Gardens so it's convenient for theatre goers. ��Service is good, and relatively quick. ��Love the BYOB!"
"STAY AWAY. ��I had two drinks in this place for a total of $20 and left a $3 tip... however when I got my credit card statement, they took the liberty of adding an extra $30 to the tip! ��I have been fighting with my credit card company for a month now. ��Bunch of CON ARTISTS."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE! This is my favorite sushi place...BYOB, great prices, fresh fish, dim lit atmosphere w candles...I LOVE IT! :) I usually order the philly, rainbow, spicy salmon, california, etc and I have always been pleased!"
"I had dinner here, this place is amazing! I had the best and yummiest Indian food and the free appetizer they bring before the dinner (a tomato-based soup and pita bread) was amazing. Great selection in the menu and prices are not too high. The service was good, too. Unfortunately the frozen drink I ordered was not blended very well so I could taste the ice particles in it."
"If you love great wines to go with certain foods, then this is the place for you. ��Bin 36 did a great job with allowing our table to sample so many wines to enjoy with our meal. ��The food was great!!"
"Okay agreed.. Andersonville is a place to be... I found a very good salon (sonia salon) and now this.. Great beer selection and easily one of the best bars in the area. Or, should i say in chicago.. It wasn't very crowded to begin with but surely people love this place .. Within half hour the place got very crowded and it was hard to buy beer at the bar without standing in line for sometime..Again.. Great beer selection.. Place to Go..."
"Contrary to what some have written, Nana was outstanding. The food, the service, and the prices were all exceptional. Some highlights:Duck and shrimp tostada with some of the most outstanding guac I've had.Spectacular cheese selection.Peach, cherry, habanero cobbler? Yes please!My personal favorite was the blueberry, lavender and basil pesto in the dessert. It was refreshing, yet full-bodied.Not only was the food and service wonderful, but the overall atmosphere of the restaurant makes for a great night to spend with friends.I will be frequenting Nana!"
"Love breakfast? Yolk's your place. Don't love breakfast? Yolk is still your place. Hate eggs? You can STILL find something on the menu.Yolk is my go-to place when someone suggests brunch. The food is excellent, the portions are huge, and the service is top-notch. Now, it is a busy place, so if you're looking something quiet, I wouldn't come here. But otherwise, this place is great for a date or groups of people.I am an egg-lover, so I always look for eggs that I can't make at home, or would be too time-consuming. Yolk has a huge variety of egg options, which always overwhelms me. Their french toast is also to die for. I usually don't order sweet things like that for breakfast, but I will at Yolk because they're unique and always delicious. (Try the Red Velvet French Toast sometime--holy CR"
"This place is extremely overated and overpriced for what it is. I ordered poached eggs and waited 15 minutes and then told it was going to be another 5 to 10 min. Come on people it's a poached egg for God's sake! They said that it takes time to boil water. On a restaurant stove? Not really they lost my order in the unorganized shuffle of the whole place. Worse yet after several leers my server finally came over and told me the news. I will go to another greasy spoon anyday over this place. I will never go there again. NO FOOD IS WORTH THAT WAIT. I am very unimpressed at the level of customer service and the quality of food from previous meals, since I did not get food this time I walked out and had to grab something at the 7 eleven around the corner or be late for work waiting for god know"
"My husband and I went for the all you can eat crab legs special on Tuesday night. ?It was amazing. ?We made a reservation and our table was ready the second we walked in the door. ?We knew what we wanted so we ordered right away and within 2 minutes the crab legs were in front of us. ?They were really hot, so we knew they were super fresh. ?The waiter was very attentive, even though the place was packed. ?We never had to wait for more legs. ?They were delish and huge! ?We also got a Bloody Mary which was great as well, but almost too filling since we were trying to binge on the crab. ?The tables are super close together, so if you have issues about personal space, coming during off hours might be a good option for you. ?The only negative thing I would say is that the parmesan crusted corn "
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. I like the decor and the service. The one problem I have is; every time I go, I forget what I liked last time because the menu is very overwhelming. The one other thing that can be improved is the size of the tables. If you are four people and want to share food, you cannot fit the table and have to be creative with where you put your glass vs. your plate vs. the food..But the food is great."
"When I think of 50/fifty I think of Walden's famous last words: The world is your oyster. At 50/Fifty the worlds not only becomes your oyster, but your shining blue pearl of delight. A decadent experience that I will never forget but always cherish. When I first set eyes on this establishment I thought, ""Christina, this place is paradise."" Once setting foot inside, you will experience the most exquisite service imaginable. The server, will seat you, dismiss you, then up-sale you on a delighftully decadent lemonade-raspberry- cherry- mudslide. And let me tell you, it is pure perfection. Jubilation in a tall glass. Glee in a cup. Glory in goblet. The burgers? SUBLIME! Not only are they overcooked to my liking, but also slathered in a thick majo, and tossed ever-so-gently atop a stale brioche"
Foods still great after all these years and priced right!
"Favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant! Lasagna is a must try, truly melts in your mouth. Chef Tony is known for his bolognese sauce and the pizza is perfectly thin and crisp. Highly recommend this spot, especially when you can sit outside, but really anytime!"
"My aunt and I order at from here about once a week and love it. ��If i could give a delivery driver an award, I would give it to robbie. ��I have seen him multiple times and he is always charming and friendly. ��He once ran to the closest Walgreens to get us back our change. ��The other driver, the big mexican guy is a jack***. ��The service over the phone is average, ��The garlic knots are also average. ��I recommend the Chicken with mash potatoes, ��It is so good, plus they serve it with a pita bread. ��It is definitely the best value on the menu. ��I like the barbeque pizza as well as the buffalo, however the multiple cheese pizza is a little to cheesy for me. Those are the only 3 pizzas i have tried so far, I will write after trying the seafood pizza! Overall, this is a good place! pizza is slig"
"It's a shame when an otherwise great restaurant has a pretentous hostess that ruins the atmosphere. ��The hostess is the first person you are greeted by and it's just not fun to go to a restaurant where he or she acts like a big shot because the place is popular. ��It ruins the whole mood. ��The woman working the hostess stand last night had long brown hair, white dress and boots on - never seen her before and I come frequently since I live in the neighborhood ... I hope that she changes her tune, she was a real bummer to deal with."
"Our family goes to this restaurant and orders out 2-3 times a month. I absolutely love the steak selection, the filet is so juicy and tender it melts in your mouth. I am also a big seafood fan and really enjoy the different fish selections Wildfire has to offer. We often order the Halibut or the Cod and really enjoy both. Our favorite dessert is the seasonal blueberry pie, it is sweet and tart all at the same time. We recommend this place to anyone!"
"Best price in Chicago for Goose island Green Line which is a beer that has hops. ?If you never tasted this exclusive beer to Chicago, well shame on you."
"This used to be my favorite Pizza stop in Chicago. ��Working in the city, I recommend this Giordano's to everyone. ��Until now.The pizza is still fantastic, our server was nice. ��Not much personality, but nice. ��Management is horrible and an embarrassment to any organization. ��A friend from England had offered to buy lunch and after dinner he presented a traveller's check to the server. ��All seemed fine. ��She returned asking for identification. ��He gave it to her and she returned later saying that they were unable to take the check. ��We asked for the manager and we asked him why he would not take it. ��He smeared the reverse of the check which showed it to be valid and his answer was ""We can not take it because you are not from Illinois."" ��That was the only reason he would not take it. ��We tr"
"This place was really fun. ��The zillions of ��appetizers that accompanied our meal were all very tasty, and colorful. ��My Husband took me here for my birthday dinner on Halloween. We were fortunate enough to be sat next to a group of Asian College students who were just finishing, which meant less smoke in our faces, no loud people sitting with us, and a more traditional atmosphere. ��Lets face it, the service is shit- you need to be prepared to be ignored, or to go up and tell the waitress what you want, and not get fussy about it. ��With that in mind, we had an awesome time..unlike the yuppie assholes who sat near us and expected to be waited on hand and foot. ��Get real! ��Go to Applebee's- its where you belong. Also, unless you believe children should be exposed to smoke, don't bring your k"
"Nice location off Michigan Avenue, has small portions and great cheese and wine list, this place was fun and the food was great!"
"'SUNDA' = that's Japanese for 'VIAGRA DEPENDENT'.Another classically smarmy Chicago 'face-place' for the East Bank Club'in suntan booth, liposuction and hair transplant set. Don't forget to stall in front of the place while parking your leased EuroTrash sports car --like all the other cologne-zone-clones.The food tries sooooo hard to be interesting -- but it's copied straight from similar's in LA -- from two years ago. The 'authentic' Filipino ��Pancit -- was anything but."
All I can say is great. ��Great menu and decent service.
"I had the roasted meatloaf. All I can say is, INCREDIBLE!!!!"
Wow! I am from a small town in Michigan where my father owns an Italian pizza joint. ��All of his recipes have been handed down from Sicily--let's suffice it to say... ��I know good pizza. ��I was VERY impressed at the selection of pizzas offered as well as the unique blend of Italian/Brazilian tastes. ��I will most definitely become a regular at this well priced/delicious eatery. ��PS. I cannot wait to bring my dad.
A VERY pretentious place and the music sucks. The drinks are very expensive but the outdoor garden is cool I used to ge there when it was Bransfields. I liked it better then.
"The Purple Pig was so good! I loved it! ��The best thing about this restaurant is their small portions which allowed us to order tons of stuff and share it. ��We even shared with the couples (who were strangers) sitting next to us at the communal tables! ��The wine selection was amazing, and I still have cravings for the deep fried deviled egg."
"Best hot dogs's in chicago. Not just your typical hot dog's. Tons of different kinds of sausage cooked different ways. Lots of toppings. The relish is bright green, neon green actually. They really know their stuff here. If it's busy don't turn away, we waited and it was great."
"Gotta love Sultan's Market, the place that made me a fan of falafel sandwiches, where in the past I avoided them like the plague. Plenty of vegetarian and vegan options, quick if not polite service, and tolerable ambiance.Dunno about this talk about how cheap it is, however--I can't leave with a meal for my wife and I for less than $25. $10 for rice and falafel sandwich (including tax) seems a bit steep, though they are located in the den of bullshit boutiques that is Wicker Park, so I imagine rents are steep. -1 star for the prices and service; otherwise, a gem."
"Well let me first say I have had the food from here before and I enjoyed it. ?I thought what a great place to bring my family (since my mother was born in Cuba) for a good authentic meal. ?So on a saturday afternoon at 1pm we pulled up. ?It was a glorious Chicago afternoon and a perfect day to sit outside. ?But they wouldn't seat 5 people in the patio area. ?Yep, thats right with only about 8 tables occupied and plenty of room for us to fit at a table meant for 4, the host wouldn't seat us outside. My sister asked twice if she was sure she couldn't seat us and the hostess' response was Sorry we get busy ?Well it was 1pm... they weren't that busy and we were 5 paying customers!!! I will never be going back, how could she not accomodate paying customers! Lets just say my mother wasn't please"
"Just a little background before the review: ?My wife has been a food professional for 35 years, worked with (or hired) many top celebrity chefs and has been on Food TV etc several times. ?We love food. ?Last week, we were in Chicago and had just attended an event in the morning which included food and drinks. ?We were walking up Clark St at about 1:00pm when my wife saw Frontera Grill and thought it would be great to stop in and try a couple of appetizers before leaving town. ?We actually got a table right away, but when we only ordered soup, an appetizer and one entree, the waiter became extremely rude. ?He actually said The salads are at the top of the menu, the appetizers in the middle, and the entrees at the bottom. ?The appetizers are very small...you will not be filled up...you need "
"Can't really write a review, since I haven't been to this place for 6 years, but last I remembered that it was an amazing experience. ��The food was amazing and the ambiance looked fresh and clean. ��I didn't get to sit at the bottom level, but the bar lounge upstairs was very trendy and cool. ��Made me feel like I was VIP.I need to go back. ��They need one here in So Cal."
"Mmm, popcorn...I took my boyfriend to GE for his birthday dinner and we were not disappointed, though I will say there were a couple of blah dishes. ��The steak tartar appetizer was bland--the sauce that accompanied it didn't do anything for what I'm sure was a great cut of beef. ��I also wasn't overly impressed with GE's desserts. ��I call them ""concept desserts"" in that they were interesting to look at, but when it came time to eat them there was nothing fantastic there. ��I was waiting for a surprise with each bite and there wasn't one. ��Regardless, I do like the fact that everything GE serves makes you think...the plating is always interesting.Now on to the positives. ��The popcorn...mmm...seriously good stuff, people! ��Granted, if I hosed my popcorn in butter and oil at home and then put c"
"Crazy, crazy, CRAZY good pizza. Literally redefines pizza for any pizza lover - I cannot enjoy anything else after finding this gem!Great atmosphere, love that it's in the middle of a little neighborhood (off the beaten path), that there's patio seating, and that the passionate owner can always be found on premise. The quality of the ingredients sets this place apart from any other 'joint' in town - it is all fresh and it is all addictive!"
"I love the red velvet cup cakes and the coffee at this bakery, but I think the prices are a bit too high. I feel like it use to be way more reasonable a few years ago."
"I so love this place, and can't wait til' I go back... again. The food is great, but the decor is what I love the most. They really did a great job putting this place together. And the mac & chesse is to die for! The Wilde Burger is awesome too. I just wish they had the mac & cheese on the late night menu!"
"The pizza was good, service HORRIBLE. ��Our hotel recommended this Giordano's location as ""the authentic Chicago-style pizza experience"" and we were looking forward to it. ��The obviously do a booming business, but their service was some of the worst I have ever experienced. ��After waiting 1.5 hours for ��a table, when we were finally seated (next to the host station, at the front door) our server ignored us for a full 20 minutes before even acknowledging our presence (though 2 other tables across the aisle from us, seated just after us, were greeted and attended to before we were). ��It took another 20 minutes to get water, which arrived about the same time as our pre-ordered pizza. ��The antipasto salad was mediocre.The waitstaff was clearly overwhelmed, and when I tried to speak to the manag"
"Bacon in a bloody mary? Genius. I crave these things. Why everyone does not put bacon in bloody mary's is just a shame. Huge portions, good food, great drinks, and a patio is always a plus."
"I ��love coast's sushi more than any other sushi in Chicago! I love everything about this place (food, price, service, atmosphere, BYOB...), but the only drawback is that they do not take reservation on the week end... which makes it hard to get a table and make my plans there. So I don't go there on the week end...too crazy!"
"I took Dan here for his Birthday dinner. It was near the bar where I was having his party. They do not take reservations for parties less than 6 so know that you will be waiting, but we got there at 6:30 and we didn't have to wait. I found out this place is BYOB only on weekdays, but trust me get the cocktails are amazing. Our waiter Gabriel came to our table and he was a waiter Rockstar! He made this experience so worth it because he was engaging and listened to us. We were thinking of trying the refajo - Combination of light beer and ""Colombiana"" Colombian soda, but Gabriel said it was so sweet. I got the Sangria and Dan tired this very strong but tasty drink. The name is stumping me. We started out with the Grilled Mariscos Combination and if you love seafood you will lick the plate. Th"
Best Vietnamese food. I ordered Pho but accidentally ordered the kind with raw meat. They were so nice and brought me the kind with cooked beef. They have the best pork fried rice and lemon grass chicken. Can get pretty busy but not overly loud. Fast service. When you go to a restaurant and there are a lot of Vietnamese eating there that must be a good sign.
a china town classic.authentic.inexpensive.delicious.totally cool!!
YUMMY!!!! Worth the wait
"How do you mark 4.5 stars here? That's what I meant,,,,anyway here is my review:This is one !of the most bizare ""non-chain"" group of chain restaurants you will find in Chi-Town. Look for 3 small yellow taco stands on Asland near Division, across the street from each other! They serve the most DELICIOUS steak tacos, burrito's, tostadas etc in Chicago (other locdations have opened up with varying names) and found one in DesPlaines! Absolutely LOVE them and wish I had the money to find the owners here and buy myself a chain. But would it stay the same? Good question, and definetly not if I am in charge of cooking anything.The meats (my favorite is the steak, must try) are totally tender, extremely flavorful, juicy, mouth watering (seriously) char-grilled (steak) did I say delicious yet? They "
"We went last Sunday night as a some friends recommended this place. ��The owner was very welcoming when we arrived and there was a woman singing some jazz and man playing the guitar, which creating an very pleasurable atmosphere. ��The Romanian wine was quite enjoyable and the food was delicious. ��We highly recommend this place!"
"My take out order was messed up so that was not a good start. ��I had to make my own rice since they forgot to put it in. �� I might as well have cooked the whole meal. ��The ropa vieja and frijoles negros were kind of tasteless. ��Too many Latin places I've been to in Chicago leave out the authentic ingredients and spices and everything comes out tasting just plain salty and one dimensional. ��This is one of them. ��I don't get all the hyped up reviews - either they come from people too far removed from the real thing and what it's supposed to taste like or they're friends of the house. Sorry, but not worth it."
"Fogo is the BEST Brazilian steak house in Chicago! ��Fogo de Chao has the best steaks, plantain and bread!! Best beef ribs! Texas de Brazil has the best salad bar and their lobster bisque soup is superb and Brazzas has good meat too but Fogo is still #1 to me because of their meat and plantain. I just wish Fogo has discounts like Brazzas and Texas de Brazil."
"Great pizza, great beer. Need I say more? The service was awesome!"
"This place is ��for the nouveau riche... Plainly and simply the most pretentious excuse for dining I've ever experienced. ��I'm not quite sure what all the raving over this place is about... is it a status thing, to say that you've dined there? ��The only thing I really enjoyed about the experience was the service and the atmosphere. ��Yes, the preparation and presentation of the dishes are creative and unique, but I'm still missing something, something I really don't care all that much to get."
"I live very close to here. ��I brought my Dad on the way to a Sox game since we take the Kedzie brown line. ��The flavors were great. ��You get pretty large portions, but don't leave feeling stuffed. ��We got their saffron persian gelato for dessert. ��My Dad was wondering ifit was sold it grocery stores; it was a perfect start to a Sox game. ��Who knew?"
"This is hands down my favorite Steak House in the city. I've been coming here for the last ten years and it just keeps getting better!From the moment you walk in and are greeted by the smiling hostesses to eating the BEST steak in Chicago to waddling out the door with a happy tummy, I love this restaurant. Now let me rave about my dinner experience. ��My friend and I went on a Thursday evening and arrived for our 7:30pm reservation a few minutes early and were promptly seated at one of the cozy booths by the bar. ��The people watching from these seats is fantastic - looking out the window or watching the people at the bar is an experience. For our cocktails before dinner, I had a Black Cherry martini which is my favorite (I have tried making it at home and it's not the same!!) and he enjoyed"
"This is one of those places where the customer service makes the otherwise good food taste like a wet sock. Been there twice and, unfortunately, was served by the rudest server (Chuck) both times. The first time we met him, about 10 minutes into eating our food, he asked us if we wanted boxes and kept coming back to ask the same question ... even after we told him that we need time eating since we did order quite a number of dishes. We felt rushed and unnecessarily so,seeing how there was no queue of people waiting for a table. But we laughed it off telling ourselves that he probably used to work at the Container Store and thus is obssessed with boxes/boxing stuff.The second and what will be my last time, we asked for the peking duck and bbq'd chicken but was told that since it's almost cl"
"I can't say enough about this place! The owners are really great people and the food is so incredibly fresh. The pho soup (I've only had the beef) can't be beat - the first time I had it, I went back 3 times in the same week. Other favorites are the lemongrass chicken, chicken fried rice, and the Simply It beef. The prices are really reasonable too - just went with a table of 7 and the bill worked out to be less than $20 per person (BYOB helps!!). This place is a must."
"Brussels sprout salad is great, drinks are good, service is mediocre, frustrating to always have to sit in the small, uncomfortable bar area."
I have been to Sushi X a number of times and have never once been disappointed. I order dragon rolls whenever I get sushi and these are definitely the best I've had...by far! Their godzilla roll is also really great. The portions are huge! It's also BYOB...you can't go wrong with that!
I love this place! ��I take all my friends here and they love it too. ��We're hooked!
"Belgian beer heaven - this alone gets it 6 stars. so many to choose from it is absolutely ridiculous especially being a big belgian fan. Its always really crowded and the food is really overrated even the mussles which are advertised ��like they are the best in the world. But with a beer selection like they have however, they can pretty much fail every other category and get 4 stars from me. But nothing fails, the food is still ok, its just not great. Wish i could give 4.5 stars because in my opinion, this is what the place deserves. 4.5"
"The thing is, I want to love The Chicago Diner, every time I go I look at the menu and am so excited at all the choices I have to choose from. Then I order something and it's usually lacking flavor! Maybe I'd be able to give this place 5 stars if I didn't know how to cook most of the stuff on their menu, BUT I make wayyyyyy tastier dishes than they do. Being a Vegetarian/Vegan does not mean that your dishes need to be flavorless!! Is it because the cooks in the kitchen aren't Vegetarians? Do they just not care that the food lacks flavor?? I know that Jo is an amazing Chef but I'm starting to think she has no part in the restaurant anymore. It seems as though there is no quality control.To sum it up: The Chicago Diner is really a hit or miss. I've had some pretty good dishes there, but I've"
"I am willing to put my vote in that the Violet Hour is one of the very best bars in the country, if not the best.I have long been a fan of the bar, and followed the bartenders' methods and formulas for crafting drinks. ��Everything on the menu is solid; there is a perfect drink for everyone, and for every season. ��Having some of the best cocktails in the country isn't the very best part about the Violet Hour. ��What makes it the best bar in Chicago is how it set the trend for all of the great bars to come along since, and led the cultural revolution that is craft cocktails in Chicago. ��The Kold-Draft ice you see in any establishment that wishes to be taken seriously, the fresh juices, homemade syrups and bitters, these are all thanks to the Violet Hour.My most recent visit was just as phenom"
"I enjoyed the ambiance until I paid closer attention to the exposed brick wall. ��I'm not saying that it needs to be so clean that it looks fake, but at least let me eat without wondering if some of it's diseased-appearing mortar could cake off and work its way into my food. ��That's not character, that's just gross. ��I was less and less enthralled with our seated position near that wall. ��Thankfully my cute date and a nice painting offset that a bit. ��Service was average, but the kitchen was doing its job noticeably well as food came out promptly.Overall I've had better food elsewhere (like ceviche at El Barco and ropa vieja at Cafe Laguardia). ��These were not as close, so the location for this type of food is convenient, but I won't be craving a return. ��It lacked flavor for the main prote"
"I have been to Demera numerous times and never had exactly the same experience as the time before... The food is consistently good- lots of options for vegans/vegetarians- AND they will make gluten-free injera if you call a day ahead and let them know. ��If you're going on a Friday or Saturday night I recommend making a reservation- I'm sure you'd have to wait without one. Overall my experience regarding service has been so-so, on a couple of occasions I have had servers that are very friendly and attentive, on others we had very standoffish servers who made themselves scarce and our water hardly ever got refilled (which isn't so great if you've ordered spicy dishes- which almost all of mine usually are). ��In general I would go back, but I think I'm gonna venture out and try a couple other "
"For Chicago vegan restaurants, this is really as good as it gets and by far my favorite place in the area when I'm dining out. I recommend this place to everyone I meet vegetarian/vegan/ or otherwise and specifically created a yelp account to give them a rating they deserve. I'm not from the area, (about an hour north of the restaurant itself) but I always make it a point to head into the city specifically to eat here. The interior is nice and cozy, but due to the small size of the building and popularity of the restaurant, the wait may be a little longer than you're used to in the evening. Service is excellent, employees are always very friendly and prompt.The vegan shakes are the best I've ever had. All of them are incredible, but my favorite has to be chocolate chip cookie dough. I have"
"Best pizza ever. This is pizza, I mean honestly. By luck I had this place recommended to me. Turned out it was the same place I eat with my cousin.Fantastic pizza. Outstanding sauce. Just wonderful."
"Favorite Breakfast place in all of Chicago!!!!!! Gourmet, fresh fruit, amazing biscuits and gravy!! ��My favorite dish is the shrimp & gritz!"
"This is a brewpub with a few outstanding beers and quite a few very good ones. ��The pizza is also quite good. ��We came for lunch, split a Caesar salad and got individual sized pizzas. ��It's always nice to see anchovies on a Caesar (at least I think it is, your mileage may vary). ��The pizza was a nice thin crisp pizza with a selection of sauce types and some interesting options for toppings. ��I've never seen clams as a pizza topping option before, but I wish it were available in more places. ��The beer was also top notch. ��The hefeweizen was especially delicious. ��Definitely worth checking out."
"(I'm Latino.. all communication was done in Spanish) I wanted to try this place since hearing buzz about it. This place was the worst. First we sit down and the waitress gives us our menus and the bus boy brings us the appetizers and water. The guy was holding all the water by the rim!!!. Then we order. ��I ordered the Bistec Ranchero and my daughter ordered the cheese Flautas. When the waitress passed out the meals she did not even ask who had what she just placed the plates down. I would understand if you forgot, but at least ask! Then my wife told her that the plate in front of her was not hers, ��The waitress just said OK and did not even bother to give it to the correct person. My Bistec was full of fat and not good at all. My daughters cheese Flautas were not cooked fully It looked lik"
Awesome food and a wonderful place to meet friends.
"I actually wanted to give 5 stars, but whenever my wife feels cold in a place in winter, I've gotta subtract a star. Sorry, Big Jones, but we've gotta take care of the ladies. I know that some of these buildings are tough to heat, but you might need to upgrade, especially toward the front of the restaurant, or install a proper air lock (like on Star Trek, the original edition).That said, I think you're going to get a 4-5 star taste here, even if you ordered at random. For me, there are several things I could have ordered on the menu. But it's all about the gumbo when it comes to my interest in this cuisine. The last gumbo I had here in Chicago, I think, was at Heaven on 7. It was good but didn't leave me feeling like I was on my trip to New Orleans, pre-Katrina. And I'm sure that they're s"
Excellent mix of cuisine. Relaxing place. Especially in summer.
"We don't have these restaurants near my hometown so having just moved to the area we wanted to try it asap as we had heard bout how good it is. My first trip to Grand Lux was very satisfying! From the ambience, to the service, to the food, to the dessert... EVERYTHING was wonderful here! Even the little bad of chocolate chip cookies I grabbed to-go on the way out were delicious! This place just makes you feel satisfied in every way! Can't wait to go back!"
"This is a catch-all Asian restaurant, nothing spectacular. ��I know my Thai restaurants well, and I wouldn't come here if you're really looking for taste explosions. ��Sushi is fine, and it's a good backup plan if you can't seem to find a restaurnat on Broadway that can seat you. I'm really into their crab rangoon too. ��Sounds like a popular appetizer here."
"Their lamb is fantastic, it melts in your mouth it's so tender and juicy! ��Also they have really great alcoholic drinks! ��I had an awesome mango martini!"
"This place is awesome!!The food is great! They are super duper busy, but you get seated in just less than an hour on any given Sunday!Highly recommended"
"The Chef's Tasting Menu was a delightful surprise and a great variety of food and wine. ��I thought that the service was exceptional, friendly and knowledgeable. ��It was fast for a four course meal but not rushed in any way. ��The atmosphere was very enjoyable and relaxed. ��We're still smiling about the presentation of the food and the unique entree creations. ��We'll go there again! ��Nice place for a date."
the best restaurant ��ever!!!!!!!!
"Staggering home from a night of drinking with the east side frenz, I practically lick the window of crisp.Closed? At 11?The worst thing about Crisp is that it isn't open at those times you need it the most. WHo can resist the fried chicken (I take mine spicy, spicy, spicy), especially when you have a belly full of booze needing to be sopped up?"
"I love La Villa. I would actually go as far as to say it is my favorite place for pizza. I usually get my food to go and order time is always reasonable even on the weekends. The thin crust pizza is perfect- great sauce, cheese, and crust. The ""stuffed"" pizza is an equally good option, and stuffed is exactly how you'll feel after eating it. Also, I wanted to add that I am very picky when it comes to eating sausage pizza and they have the best in my opinion.The calzones are another one of my favorites because it's essentially their thin crust pizza folded in half.Other than pizza I would highly recommend getting the deluxe meatball sandwich on garlic bread with mozzarella cheese. It comes with three really huge tasty meatballs and the steak fries are the shiznit."
"For pictures and more information, please to go: http://rollingwrites.blo��_Why why why? Why is there no deep dish where I stay? I still think of the deep dish pizza at Giordano's ever so often.It was very crowded and the pizza took a long time to come. (more than half an hour). But, it was worth the wait. Before the pizza came, we ordered a few pieces of garlic bread first because we were really hungry.We ordered a spinach deep dish. It was oh-so-yummy! Who would have thought vegetables in a pizza would have tasted so good! Two of us shared one pizza and were stuffed silly, and couldn't move after the meal. It was that filling. But what's more important is that it was really good! Loved the crust and everything else about the deep dish pizza!"
One of the best mexican places around...hands down. ��The food tastes home-made and the margaritas are excellent. ��You know it's a good place when the staff has been around since they opened. ��The only thing missing is valet parking so I can go more often.
"This may not be the most authentic vietnamese restaurant out there, but it's still good. The owner, Tuan, was very courteous and helpful.. the place looked neat... servers were kind.. food were delicious.. i would definitely come back again... It's something new... not your traditional vietnamese cuisine, but shouldn't be hated upon. dishes are always altered in some way.. may taste good.. may taste awful.. but nevertheless, worth the try! you'll never know if you like something or not until you've taste it.be audacious and try this restaurant. ps. for that one message below.. i believe by izzy.. you're so vulgar.."
"About a month ago, me and 10 of my girls had dinner here to celebrate a birthday. We had a great time while there, but soon after reality set in for half of us: FOOD POISONING. We all work at a busy Gold Coast salon, and 2 of us (one was the birthday girl) had to cancel their fully booked saturdays, one had a flight sat pm and had to change her seat so she was closer to the bathroom, and the rest of us were just left feeling miserable and clinging to the toilet. We all understand that is a risk taken when going to eat raw fish, but the reason im writing this review is because we have been treated so horribly by the management staff since the incident. We had to call repeatly to the GM, who seemed annoyed that we were bothering him, when we could actually get him on the phone. Some of us re"
"OMG!!!!!!!!!! I love this place! Great food , Great service and the ONLY restaurant I will eat steak at."
"we ordered all three snacks they offered.... ��Basket of Gougeres - House Made Parmesan Cheese Puffs, Truffle Honey. ��These were incredible, soft, cheesy, fresh and I felt compelled to eat more than two or perhaps three, hmm I think it was four or five. ��They were that good... and the truffle honey - amazing! ��The House Marinated Olives - Thyme, Anise, Garlic & Orange Zest. ��Tanguy and delicious with a great mix of green and black."
"Great food and good prices! Classy atmosphere without feeling overly trendy, or stuffy. The Seafood salad was amazing, so much seafood, I couldn't finish it. Lots of different choices to chose from on the menu, I also hear their ribs are great. It's a must visit in Andersonville, it is no wonder why they've been there so long"
"This place is awesome! My boyfriend and I went here for the Tapas. Being first-timers at this restaurant, we decided to take our waiters suggestions. We ordered about 4 different plates, and each one that came out was better than the one before. It was also more than enough food to keep the two of us full for the rest of the night. On top of the food, the service and great and it's a very romantic and cozy atmosphere. But that's not all....the best part is that at the end of our meal our waiter presented us with a contact card that asks for our name, email, mailing address and birthday. Since then I have received one $14 gift card thanking me for our service and recently received another $15 gift card for my upcoming birthday. If that's not great customer service, I don't know what is."
"Went out for a late meal after a night of clubbin, expecting a nice quiet meal. This was my first, and last meal to be had here. My friends and I ordered orecchiette, an individual pizza and spaghetti with clams and mussels. ��Both bowls of orecchiette were undercooked to the point of being crunchy inside. ��They were replaced, one made with orecchiette as before and the other made with spaghetti. ��The spaghetti was as undercooked as the first dish, and the replaced orecchiette bowl was just barely cooked enough to be edible, but now came out being terribly over-salted. ��So much so that it made the roof of my mouth tender!Instead of comping the entrees in question, they gave a pitiful discount that didn't even cover the cost of the tip. Additionally, aside from the food, the restaurant is sm"
"Although Fogo de Chao did not quite live up to my expectations it does have some great features that stand out. ��The service was exceptional and when you have your card green the food just keeps coming...which leads to the 2nd great feature, you will absolutely not leave hungry. ��Further, there is enough variety to keep things interesting. ��The salad bar is also great, although I refrained from consuming too much vegetation, the focus is really on the meat, as it should be. ��Finally, the atmosphere is energetic and fun. ��It is a great place to go in a group. ��Overall I did have a great time and I would go back, however, the quality of the steaks was simply not top notch. ��I have definitely had better steaks at some of the many reputable steak houses around Chicago such as Gibsons, Chop Hou"
"Must say that I'm nuts for Nana's. ��I've eaten there three times in the last two weeks - once each for breakfast, lunch and dinner - and have had three first class meals. ��The food is intelligently conceived, well executed, and the Mexican influences are welcome but not overwhelming. �� ��Having lived in Phoenix for 12 years I've eaten my share of huevos rancheros and Nana's are right there with the best, along with their queso fundido which should frankly be made against the law. ��But the real revelation was dinner - grilled skirt steak with chimichuri for me, quail for my dinner companion - both of which seemed to exemplify what Nana's is all about. ��Beautiful food, complex flavors, no pretense. ��My only regret is that they aren't in my neighborhood. ��If they were I'd be there every day."
"I don't usually review, but I wanted to express how wonderful this restaurant is. ��I've been in several times and from time to bottom this menu is unique and really, really good. ��It's affordable, the atmosphere is great and the food is spot on. ��Definitely go on Saturday and get the goat--it's DELICIOUS."
"Chicago's a pretty magical place. I mean, it's given us so much... Obama, Oprah, ... Doug. And if the line wrapping around the corner was any indication, it's not necessarily in that order. My Grub buddies Scott and Blake raved about the spot, and I'm pretty sure you will too my friend. If not for one simple reason, and say it with me class ... Duck... Fat... Fries. Sound amazing? We'll that's because they are amazing. Doesn't sound amazing? That's because you lived under power lines as kid. Make sure you hit up Doug's on Friday or Saturday, because, otherwise, it's regular fries for you... which we might add, are a masterpiece unto themselves. But the crispy, savory, the-gods-don't-have-it-this-good, fries are just one of the many reasons to hit up Hot Doug's. The others? Well I think som"
"I went with some friends a few days ago here on a busy Friday evening. My mood was slightly depressed but when I entered Sun Wah, my mood began to get uplifted.The service was not that good but the atmosphere was lively. Not enough wait staff at all ! I'm not a big fan of Chinese food and mainly went for the duck. We ordered a few side dished which were nothing spectacular at all...the duck however was Delicious !!!! The next time I go back there I will be ordering 2 ducks and nothing else but a side of rice. Best DUCK I EVER HAD :) so i forgive the crappy service"
"the food here is great and very tasty. However, the prices are very high and I just found out they raised them even more. I mean it's just rice and veggies... $10.25 for a Budda Bowl with brown rice is a little steep."
"not as good as i thought it would be, but maybe that's cos i ordered wrong. i came here for breakfast and got the eggs benedict. it was okay. buuuut...the cheese grits were as yummy as everyone has said... i've never had them before and they tasted like mashed up macaroni and cheese."
"This was my second time going to Calo, and it was better than I remembered! ��Our server (Marilyn) was very attentive and helpful with recommendations and menu items. ��After convincing my sister to curb her New Years resolution for one more day, we devoured the spinach dip, bread and fantastic entrees. ��I had the pesto and grilled chicken pasta, while she dined on the sausage and chicken tomato based entree. ��Both were amazing and left us full with leftovers for the next day. ��When we finished our meal, what I assume was the manager was making rounds and greeting every table to hear about their experience. ��It was very thoughtful and he even sent us a complimentary dessert. ��Again, I cannot believe I have not gone here more, having lived in this neighborhood for three years. ��This will defi"
This is a good place to get a slice as long as the pies are fresh. It can be hit and miss.
"This place is amazing! Some of the best food I've ever had--not just in Chicago but anywhere. And seriously, what restaurant offers a free limo ride to and from the restaurant? We took advantage of the offer and were greeted promptly by a limo waiting for us at our door. The restaurant itself is charming--a very cute spot for a date or a special occasion. And the food was DIVINE! ��We started with a few appetizers--the flaming cheese dish, calamari and polenta--which all were outstanding. I had the Wrapped Kataifi Shrimp for an entree and it was unbelievably yummy--golden, crispy, buttery and SO good!And beyond the delicious food, what amazing hospitabilty! We were treated liked royalty all night long. The owner, who is so generous and hilarious, treated us to two free appetizers, along wit"
"I consistently order the falafel as it's the best I've found in Chicago. The salad bar has a ton of options for folks who want to graze, it's easy to get to, and it's cheap.Not sure what more you can ask for."
"Top 3 restaurants I'm Chicago! http://Smokebeer.com 10 course tasting was killer. Chafed octopus, deconstructed ceased, spring soup from a beaker, foi GRAS, tartar pomfrites, fennel swordfish, ham hock skate wing, lamb pea pur��e, lemon blueberry icecream curc cake, chocklate ancho grenache! Enough said try this place you won't be dissapointed $200/person and you will eat like a king!"
I have enjoyed Noon O Kabab's cuisine for the last seven years and have never once been disappointed. ��The recent expansion and renovation of the restaurant compliments its gourmet cuisine and presentation. The humus is excellent. ��The Kebab is so flavorful and melts in your mouth. ��The menu selection is great for both meat lovers and vegetarians. ��The wait staff is extremely friendly and attentive. ��It is an overall an excellent dining experience.
"Beer's equivalent to Metropolis. If you have never consumed a Kwak out of the beeker shaped glass, you haven't lived. The expensive beers should not turn you off. These are beers to be EXPERIENCED not just drunk. Oh and you will be drunk off of just one, with average alcohol content levels of 9%!Try the Ham sandwich, which will blow you mind. Even Mama Kass says Eat Up."
"Quite possibly the most disappointing dinner experience ever. ��Understanding that this may have been because I went in with such high expectations I'm still giving it 2 stars. ��This is supposed to be the most romantic spot in Chicago. ��What's romantic about sitting less than three inches from the table next to you? ��Yes, its dimly lit and has nice decor...but my fiance and I seriously sat there and listened to the conversations of the people next to us because we couldn't talk to each other!Where are the choices? ��There is one cheese, one salad, one cooking style and one chocolate. ��WHAT? ��The cheese tasted like alfredo sauce gone wrong, the salad was drenched in dressing, the oil had no flavor (it was literally just oil in a pot and my piece of chicken came out looking like a chicken nugg"
"We had an event at the Fifty/50 last week and it was a amazing time! The food is to die for! With a menu based on secret sauces, you wont leave disappointed. The atmosphere for games is exciting! You really get into it. You have to try the burgers and those fried chicken wings...yum!!! I guess the only complaint is the parking situation but what do you expect for the area. BIG BIG BIG fan of the Fifty/50!"
"Wow. I mean, what else can I say that hasn't been said already? Everything about the place is absolutely top-notch. Food: The best meal I've ever had and my first experience with molecular gastronomy. The presentation was fantastic and with a clear focus on form over function (i.e. eating rabbit loin off a smoking maple tree branch). We did the twelve course tasting w/out the wine pairing and I was uncomfortably full afterwards. I can't imagine doubling that up. Service: Extremely professional and much friendlier that I had anticipated. I expected snooty but everyone was very nice and extremely helpful and did a great job of everything from helping us pick out a bottle of wine to describing the dishes and answering our questions.We went in October and a few of the dishes definitely had a f"
"We were delighted that Uncommon Ground came to Edgewater. ��The neighborhood really needed a good sit down place for brunch, lunch and dinner and I have had positive experiences on weekdays at this location, but today, not so much. ��We called earlier in the week to get reservations, and were told they didn't accept them for parties under 8 people. ��We arrived before 9, and there was already a long line of families waiting. ��The hostess seated families ahead of us and families after us of the same size and with children of the same age as our four year old. ��Not us, we were sent to the bar - we were told that they didn't have open tables - which clearly wasn't true because from the bar I could see a half dozen open tables in one room and several more in the back room. �� We asked the bartende"
The trick to keeping customers happy....keep those wine glasses full! ��violet hour did this quite well when I dined there with 65 colleagues last week. My wine glass was never once empty throughout the night!
"Milk and honey is decent for breakfast, I feel they're a bit overpriced and the food's so-so, but they do have good pastries and especially cookies. ��My favorite restaurant in the area is Picante, though. ��They have the freshest organic food you can find at reasonable prices and they're open late."
"This is my all-time favorite pizza place in the WORLD. ��(and I'm quite the pizza connoiseur!) ��It also becomes everyone's favorite place once they try it! ��(ask any of the 8 people I have brought there!) ��I don't know what I will do for stuffed pizza if I ever move away from Chicago, because there is no way anyone else can compare to their perfectly sweet sauce and doughy, tasty crust. ��I completely agree with the guy who said that this pizza gives him a mouthgasm (fabulous expression!) ��:-)"
You cannot beat their thin crust pizza and microbrews. ��It is my favorite thin crust in town.
"My friend love this place. ��I like i too, but it's a bit pricey for me since I don't eat as much as he does, but great food. ��I definitely would come back again."
"Well I was born in Port Barre, LA and went to school in Savannah, so I have to weigh in here even though this isn't my style. I've eaten here three times in the last week, and let me tell all you northerners who think you know what is, this place is for real. It's like Sunday Southern, all dressed up and top notch. I have to say, to everyone who thinks the gumbo lacks spice or something, GUMBO ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE SPICY and I don't know where you all got the idea. there are as many recipes for gumbo as there are cooks in Louisiana, and I'll tell ya, Big Jones has an awesome one. If you like it spicy, that's what hot sauce is for. They do need to put out some chiles and vinegar with the gumbo, and I talked to the owner, Paul, about that (he visited our table every time I've been there) and "
"First meal in Chicago and it's a winner. Fantastic crispy carnitas sandwich. Really tasty, and perfect size. Also, they have soda water on tap...for free! Love it!"
Great greek Food the very best around had the lamb chops ... to die for
"I have to agree with all of the other 900+ reviewers this place is awesome! You should be prepared to wait in line, sometimes for an hour or more but it is well worth the wait... even in our Chicagoland winters. The range of hot dogs is staggering, concoctions that I would never dream of but that are super tasty. There is a good reason they were featured on Food Network a few times, they truly are a Chicago landmark and best of all they are right next to Eagle Insurance, if you grew up in northern Illinois in the 1980's you will appreciate that reference."
"Price, Quantity and Quality. We all understand inflation but if the idea is to have your customers return over and over why would you attack all three. The price is what it is but the quantity should remain and if the quantity lessens the quality should remain. In my view point being a customer for many years it is getting harder to return with all of these changes."
"I love the food here, I've come for both lunch and dinner. ��The lunch buffet is great and the tandoori chicken is to die for. �� All of the food here is so flavorful. ��I've never ordered anything I didn't like from here.My only complaint is the buffet price. ��With tip it's over $20 a person, that's pretty expensive for a lunch buffet, so unless you've got the money to spend, it's not for everyday. ��I definitely still highly recommend it."
"OMG...i've tried almost all the thai places lining Western ave up here in the square and now that I've found opart it will take a really good review to sway me. ��I've ordered from here twice now once for take out and once for delivery. ��Delivery time = frickin amazing I was quoted 45 it was here in 20. ��Unheard of! ��Both times the food is phenomenal. ��First time Tom Kha soup great flavor nice blend of cocunut and spices. ��Second time Wonton (they put the dumplings and veggies in a seperate box so nothing gets soggy!) Really really flavorful broth soup. ��Shumai app tender, moist great dipping sauce. ��First time ordered ginger chicken based on other reviews great. ��Second time was with bf got shrimp tempura crunchy not soggy which is great for delivered fried food...and the pad see eiw is ju"
"LOVE this place! It is very authentic to the little cuban eateries in Miami. I ony wish they had an avocado salad! Love the black beans and rice, great tostones, cuban bread authentic.....so good!"
"Old Szechuan is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Chicago. ?Yes, it's in Chinatown and doesn't have the best decor, but it's authentic, reasonably priced, and delicious! ?I have been a loyal patron for 8 years and I keep coming back. ?This restaurant is recommended by a Chinese professor from the University of Chicago and my Chinese parents.Both the hot pot and the regular menu items are great. ?This is what we usually order:Chef's Special Sizzling Rice Ginger PorkGarlic SpinachDry chili chicken (Don't eat the chili peppers)Salt and Pepper SquidMaPo Tofu (Spicy!!)(I may not have gotten the names exactly right)The saltiness of the garlic spinach goes great with the Sizzling Rice dish. ?They also serve deep fried mantou - YUM!A note about how to line up at this restaurant. ?You need to "
"Mastro's definitely delivered on ambience and service. We started out with the Oysters Rockefeller which were a tad bit hot. The warm spinach salad was amazing and the Chillean sea bass was good. (surprisingly large portion of fish) I had heard about the warm butter cake and was inclined to try it, but again this dish was served a bit too warm for my liking. Perhaps the temps were a bit off that night, nevertheless I will probably go back to try it again."
The cocktail menu was my favorite part. ��I'm a huge fan of the one that uses cilantro. ��So unique and who would have thought?! I too have seen the menu mature over the year which I think is really cool. ��It's a testament to the chef's dedication to it's success.
"I am continuing to review places I like in my new neighborhood. ��I like this place. ��Very good beer menu that is able to compete with other neighborhood bars. ��I have been there twice, and once the food we had was excellent! ��Great burger! ��The second time, the aps we had all seemed too salty, maybe it was me or an off day. ��I like the wine prices, and like that they have some French selections. ��The staff is fairly friendly. ��There are a lot of pretty impressive bars around this area so it is hard to really stand out. ��Bad apple is one of the better joints I have checked our recently and I will definitely be back even though last time I thought the food was just OK."
"This is definitely one of the better deep dish pizzas I've had in Chicago. ��The crust is like no other spot you can find in the city. ��My favorite here is the sausage by far. ��I'm not a big fan of some places that put an entire patty on the pizza as a sausage topping, I prefer the pieces scattered all over the top. ��Great spot and cool atmosphere in a very laid back setting. ��The service was good too!"
"What a rude restaurant! ��We had heard great things about it, but the reality was otherwise. ��The food was not good enough to justify the rude service. ��I even got sick from eating it. ��I've never felt so relieved to get something out of me! ��This place is noisy and not worth the wait. You don't need more choices of beer to make a great bar, you just need a few good ones."
"Last night was the first time I have been to coast and I loved it!Hamachi carpaccio was awesome, nice and light..good for an appetizer. My favorite of the rolls was definitely the spicy tuna, might have been the best I have ever had and the sweet potato tempura was also amaaaazzzzing. Of the specialty rolls I really enjoyed sunrise and the rainbow roll. Will definitely be back to Coast sometime soon..."
second time here ....... ��and still the same problems the food is not that good and so is the service
So excited that they reopened again. ��Love the meats. ��The melted in my mouth once again. ��The salad bar has so many different choices. ��All and all excellent!
"Awesome place! The shrimp and scallops are a bit bland...but the flatbread and the steaks are awesome. And you can't go wrong with bacon wrapped dates.Our waiter was very funny and took good care of us. We got the deal where you pay $58 per person, and then the chef just sends out a bunch of the most popular tapas. It's fun, because you just sit back and relax and they just surprise you with a new dish every few minutes. We told him to go light on the seafood, and he did, since my friend is pregnant and isn't exactly craving it.Great place to go!"
"Without a doubt, the best service, the best salad bar & the best grilled/roasted meat I have ever had in Chicago!! I've been twice for my birthday & i took my oldest son once. He said it is the best restaurant he has ever been to (in his long 12 years of life lol). If you have a big appetite"
"Gnocchi was soooo frickin good, Soft not hard the way it should be, I'll be back often."
"What a diamond in the rough! I understand that this terrific restaurant has been in town for 13 years and I finally had the opportunity to experience 3rd Coast.In short, the food was great and menu diverse. It has a neighborhood atmosphere and great service. They were extremely flexible and kid friendly - important with a two year old.We had the fortunate opportunity to meet the proprietors, Chris and Janet. ��Make it a point to say hi to them as they are two of the friendliest - knowledgeable restaurant owners I have met.Treat yourself and head to 3rd Coast."
If you're up for a killer breakfast I'd highly suggest you hit up Uncommon Ground! ��The service is fantastic and the food is even better. ��I'm happy every time that I eat here!
"I don't know what you call this pizza - it's not traditional Chicago, that's for sure. ��But it's really, really delicious! ��I tried it this weekend and was pleasantly surprised!"
"I'm not much of a greek cuisine fan, but this place is really tasty. Next time I might choose salad bar only (you have a choice of meat+salad bar or salad bar only) and gorge on the delights in the salad bar."
"I LOVE this place! ?My husband and I were searching for a good Vietnamese place, and most that we came across were kind of French fusion, making them very expensive. ?NOT the case with Simply It. ?It's really great food at reasonable prices, and the owner (Tuan I think?) is very kind and calls everybody my dear. ?This place is great for groups (BYOB), and it's great for a lazy weekend lunch (lunch specials valid even on weekends). ?Lunch specials come with a fried spring roll, soup, salad, and iced tea or lemonade. ?Really good deal. ?Shrimp papaya salad and calamari salad are especially great...no matter what else we order, we always order one of those."
"I adore this place. ��The owner and the wait staff are super nice, and give very personal service. ��I always get the Beef Pho, because it's delicious and has tons of bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, hot peppers, sauces, etc to put on top. ��The lunch special is fantastic at a very reasonable price. ��As far as other dishes, I can't recommend others obviously, but I've had bites of my friends' and they were all delicious. ��If anything goes in the least bit wrong (which it doesn't, usually) with your visit the staff are the nicer about it than any restaurant I've ever been to. ��I messed up my take-out order one time and THEY felt bad about it and gave me extra stuff and a drink while I waited...so nice! ��One of my favorite places to eat in Chicago."
"I know this place is run by the Cheesecake Factory, and while the food is similar, the atmosphere is far superior. ��With a large dining room, and great seating off of Michigan Avenue, a romantic dinner with dessert can run 1/2 the price of other places that offer a similar setting. ��One of the few great values off Michigan."
"Gilt Bar is the perfect place for a group or date. The decor is fabulous and the fun happy crowd just adds to the overall atmosphere.Food was excellent. Their red house wine was cheap and tasty. My table tried numerous things on their menu. All of it was good but my favorites were the corn bread, paris mushroom & truffle pasta, and chocolate cream pie. I definitely plan to go back!"
"Everything was amazing EXCEPT the veggie dog. Please don't order it. When you bite into it, it is the consistency of toothpaste. Please, I beg of you - don't order it!!!"
"My experience at Bin 36 can only be described as divine. ��Their House Smoked Salmon was rich and decadent and their recommended pairing of Bin 2 - ��NV Vouvray, Demi-sec, Vigneau-Chevreau, ""Petillant,"" - was perfect, the bubbles beautifully cleansed my palate and the crisp juicy flavor was a wonderful counterpoint. ��The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, and, best of all, passionate. ��I noticed their cheese-monger restocking the cheese chill chest and struck up a conversation. ��In no time he had brought out a cheese plate with his favorites for me to sample, on the house. ��Log off the computer and go!"
"It's sad when unreasonable people (like Bianca S.) who rant and ramble about a simple misunderstanding, have a forum to explode and disrespect others. ��Her one-sided viewpoint is all that is shown here. I'd like to express another perspective:#1...CLEARLY STATED ON YELP: �� NO RESERVATIONS!!!!! and NO CREDIT CARDS (in other words, CASH only...there is a lovely ATM conveniently located next to the cash register)How can one be so quick to condemn when everything is CLEARLY LISTED ON THE VERY YELP PAGE you are writing?#2...Party of 12, on a Saturday night? ��What, no red carpet???#3 The cashier gave compensation...NO, THE GRATUITY WAS NOT DENIED to the server....the compensation equalled about 20% of your bill. Enough? You enjoyed every morsel didn't you?#4...It's BYOB, you're lucky they have g"
A wonderful fine dining experience!My wife invited me to Fogo De Chao for my birthday surprise and I must say that I was totally impressed with everything they had to offer. To begin with - their salad bar was by far the most spectacular salad bar I have ever seen and with the most extensive selections of fresh greens and other things. The all you can eat choices of freshly cook over open flame meats (choice of 7 different) was also spectacular and delicious. our food was very well accompanied by a wonderful bottle of South American red wine that made it a totally 5 star experience. �� ��Fogo De Chao is hands down one of my top 5 restaurants in Chicago.
"When I lived in Chicago, I would eat there all the time, AMAZING food. Whenever I make it out to Chicago, this is where I eat."
"I had high hope for this one. My sister thought it would be a good place to take our Dad. Here is what I liked and didn't:WHen i asked the waiter to explain the ingriediants in a few dished (the menu is ��very italian and used the not-so-usual italian items, he was kind of rude and answered my questions by repeating the same words i asked for an explanation of. ��It took hi 10 minutes to get our drink order and no bread was brought out for 20. ��When my dad asked for some olive oil and cheese acted like that was a so wrong. ��The place in ��nice enough. The have a cool garden. ��The meal itself was very good. tasty. But even though we were not expecting family portions, the portions we received were very small. ��$14 for ��6 small ravioli? ��My Bucatti was small as well. ��Enough to fit in my hand. "
"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME!  especially ��"" coxinhas"" . First, I am Brazilian, and coxinhas are one of the trade marks of Brazilian cuisines. These balls makes any Brazilian happy when they see them! Even better, when they are well made like the one at Fogo 2 go! Great, so happy to have a place like that close to my house! The pizzas, delicious!! everyone should go check it out!"
"Nope! I would not go back.Very long wait!Really loud......I've had better food at a fast food resturant.It is not about the food anymore, it is clearly about the money!I was there for two hours and didn't see one person wash their hands:(It is to bad I was so........... looking forward to eating there."
Sophisticated & saucy drinks in a semi-secret speakeasy scene. Wear violet on Monday and your 2nd drink is on the house. ��Small bite food is the perfect pairing to the hand crafted drinks and makes sure that you don't end up drinking on an empty stomach if you decide to stay for one last round.
bring back the burrito! woohooo!!
"GREAT SPICY SZE CHUAN FOOD!I have been here a few times and I have to mention that the level of spicy-ness (sp?) has not been consistent, but nonetheless, it is still good. ?I recommend the Tony's chicken. ?I wasn't expecting anything really special when I ordered it for the first time, but it is on my must order list now. ?Service is very sporadic. ?If you catch them when it's less busy, service is ok. ?On a busy day, it will be hard to get their attention. ?But trust me, the food is worth it, since they're not actually rude.Note: Most dishes are spicy so it may not be suitable for children."
Falafel sandwich is sooooooo good every time I go to Chicago I come here! I really wish I could go every day...
"Had a family dinner at Sunda last night - 20 people in the back semi-private room. Everyone raved about the food. And the service was awesome as well. Thanks to Angie for making ��all the arrangements for our group. The cripsy rice with Kobe beef tartare, Tail of Two Tunas and the Black Cod were highlights."
I've only been here for brunch a couple of times and it has been pretty good. I somewhat think i could cook pretty much everything i ate there. Although the dessert is really good! Not my favorite place to get veggie food.
Love this place- great pizza great atmosphere will be coming back
"So the other day I was walking to another establishment but passed Revolution Brewing and decided to go there instead. It was the best change of mind ever. The Apple Wood Smoked Wings = Super Tasty, spicy but still full of flavor, they don't have ranch dressing though. Margherita Pizza ��= Even Tastier, the tomatoes were to die for and the fresh basil added a lot of flavor. I had the Bottom Up Belgian Wit ��- delicious. I can't wait to go back for a dinner so I can try more food and drink more. : )This was also my first outing in Logan Square....I'll be visiting more often."
"This was a great place to try the prositto appetizers and the cheeseburger, which was one of the best I have ever had! ��Atmosphere was great seeming like a great neighborhood place to have dinner."
"Great food, great service and everything I expected. There was not a thing they could have done better for me.Be careful and pace yourself as everything is so good it is easy to fill up way too fast.Take your time and enjoy the experience."
"Last night I went to Spacca Napoli with the Windy City Pizza Club at 6pm. ?My very first thought as we walked around the corner outside the restaurant was wow this place is huge and looks really nice inside! ?When we walked in the door we were greeted immediately by the owner and then seated right away. ?Sure enough I was right, the restaurant had an Italian feel to it, with lots of tables and lighting. ?There was another large group sitting next to our table, but it didn't even seem crowded because there was plenty of space. ?Our server was great and very friendly. ?The pizza only take 3-5 minutes to bake, so they come out very fast. ?My favorite part of the restaurant is of course the pizza. ?I shared the Bufalina pizza which is Basil, Mozzarella di bufala and Olive Oil with my sister. ?"
"I have dreams about this pizza! �� ��Its one of those places where you eat it, and its not super memorable, but a week later, you're craving it. ��The atmosphere at gino's is very cool, and being able to write on anything is fun.I don't go to chicago much anymore, so I mail order it. ��It costs around $70 to have two mediums over nighted. ��They come on dry ice and you just bake them yourself.... When a good pizza locally is $20 each, the price for this quality of pizza is not bad. ��We do it once or twice a year and its a big deal around our house when the big styrofoam box shows up on the front door!This is americana at its best.... I love ""chicago style pizza"" or ""new york hot dogs"" �� Gino's and giordano's are the best !"
"I have been to this restaurant several times since moving to Chicago three years ago, however the last few visits have been very disappointing. ��After tonight, however, I will never go back for food. ��There was simply too much salt in the food (from the chips & guac to our main entrees), and when I asked to provide feedback to the chef (or one of the sous chefs), I was told that one of them could come out, but then later that they were too busy. ��I hardly ate my pollo (chicken) because I felt like it was loaded with salt, and our waitress (Christina) never asked us how the food was so I didn't have the opportunity to even think about sending it back. ��The portion sizes are way too big as well. ��I hope that somehow this feedback gets to the chef, who needs to make some changes if this resta"
"Excellent service, fantastic food cooked to perfection. Wonderful ambiance, intimate and romantic. Absolutely everything we have ordered has been delicious. Real Italian cooking which an expert hand on the spices. There's a reason this place is always slammed. My only regret is that we live too far away!!! Bellissimo!"
Great Cuban food at good prices. Staff is very friendly. BYOB makes this place a great date night or a good time for a group.
The main problem I had was no refills on iced tea. ��This was not communicated on the menu or by our server. �� The glass was 90% ice with little tea. ��The server would bring another one which we thought we were getting great service. ��Turns out when we were presented with the bill the iced tea's COST MORE than our meal.I will not be back until they change the policy on refills or at the very least make it clear that you are charged per glass. ��I have never been to another restaurant that does not give free refills on tea.
"Sunda was recommended to us, so we decided to go there for our Anniversary. ��We had no idea what to expect and were pleasantly surprised.....It was amazing! ��The atmosphere was unique, the food was amazing and the service was terrific. ��We will definitely go back and maybe will make this restaurant a yearly tradition!"
Killer combo of fries smashed around a hot dog!
"The most fresh falafel you will ever taste ,great home made food ��and such reasonable prices.You can always count on leaving satisfied.Friends from out of town come back and would choose Sultans over a fancy steak dinner.Try Chicken and lamb combo with rise with the hummus.And Yes the salad bar is a must as well."
"I have been eating at Cafe 28 for the last 10 years and can honestly sayI have not had a bad meal here in all that time. I love their coffee at  brunch with the breakfast burrito as well as the green tamales and eggs. The Cuban Chicken, Chevice, Coconut Shrimp, and Papa Rellenas are just a few of my favorites. The staff ��has always been friendly and attentive. I have noticed that much of the servers and bartenders have been there as long as I have been coming in. That is always a good sign as well as being greeted by the owners on occasion. Looking forward to spending some time on the patio before the weather changes. Keep up the good work..."
"This place is quickly becoming a favorite in my new neighborhood. Will the manager is really nice. Jarod rocks as a server. The new beer garden on the side is also sweet, reminds me of London. ��Yummy cocktails.* The hosts are always really nice too."
"With the incredible wealth of world-class breakfast spots within walking distance of this place, it boggles the mind that so many people stand and wait hours on end for their ordinary food and amateurish service. ��Not that the food was bad, nor the atmosphere uncomfortable, but the appeal was completely lost on me. ��Don't believe the hype. ��Visit Flo, Milk and Honey, Handlebar, Vella. ��These bongos are played out."
"This is the best pan pizza I've found in the city. ��The crust is excellent on this very filling deep dish pizza. ��They could give a little more when it comes to toppings, but other than that it's perfect. ��The place is more of a diner than a restaurant, having no servers. ��Also they close kind of early, which is probably the only reason I don't go there for pizza every time."
"The food and the location were great. ��I would recommend everythng we ate, especially the milk-braised pork shoulder. �� ��My only complaint was how loud it was. We were stuck in the back corner and I was at the head of the table there were two people on each side. ��I could not hear anything that my friends were saying. It was a Wednesday night at 6:00pm and it seemed too early to be that lound. �� ��Everything else was great."
We had really high expectations when we went here for my birthday and were really impressed. It was absolutely amazing!!! We still talk about it.
"Great deep dish pizza, fresh ingredients and consistent. ��Wait staff tends to play favorites on the weekends. ��The atmosphere inside could be upgraded a bit to match the level of food, but it's still a pizza place you know? ��Do you come for the atmosphere or the grub? ��Overall nothing to really complain about but a few small improvements can be made. ��You'll get over it once you start eating."
"jesus.... this place is amazing. great service, great food, insanely affordable, simple yet refined flavors. Tank Noodle = everything i like about Asian food and none of the crap i hate about Asian restaurants. great job, Tank Noodle. i WILL be back."
AMAZINGLY GOOD! Ok the food is oh so good. Tiger Cry...with the Chili Sauce that comes with it....over Jasmine Rice?!? Are you kidding me? The pad thai is great with or without protien. The fish...cooked perfection. ��Oh and it's BYOB!!
"I can't believe I got such a great Peking duck meal for $32. Three people can feast on the duck, soup and fried rice. Best meal deal in Chicago. However, the takeout service is atrocious. They mixed up our order pretty badly ... the person taking the order over the phone spoke English perfectly...the person behind the pickup counter didn't and was totally confused. It wasn't until we got home that we realized we only had three out of the five dishes we ordered. Five stars for the food. Zero for the service."
best hot dogs in Chicago.
"As far as restaurants go, this is as good as it gets. The chef @ Le Colonial creates the perfect dishes, perfect proportions and just the right twist on French & Vietnamese that you'd think it was it's own genre of food. In fact, it may be.If there is a bad seat in the house, I wouldn't know because the food is always the main point of interest for me. Their Wednesday date night is a great time to try it out if you are at all skeptical.LOVE IT!"
I have been to pequods Morton Grove all my life. I love the carmailized cheese and the little shack like place. I have never had a bad time there since i have been going there. Me and my family celebrate birthdays all the time and my kids love it. Unforunatley a couple weeks ago I witnessed something that did not make me happy at all. The young girl that was helping us was doing a fabulous job. She was great service and checked on us time to time and was not over bearing. Out of the corner of my eye I see this young girl getting scolded by this lady who i assumed was the manager and was pionting at our table. I was confused because we were fine enjoying our dinner. Our waitress did not look happy. After getting scolded she went into the kitchen and the manager came by our table. She asked 
LOVE IT! A little more Americanized than Viet-Town but super delicious. ��The owner is super friendly and everything that I have had so far has been delicious! Highly recommended.
"An OK sauce is what keeps this pizza from being Dominos. The service is atrocious and the prices outrageous. Spend $5 more and have a nice Italian meal elsewhere. If what you are looking for is fast food disgused as ethnic food, this is the place for you. And if you must eat here pay only cash as the owner is shady."
"First off, I never do reviews for restaurants... This restaurant has something going for it....I got in line at 10:45 AM yesterday morning and waited about an hour and a half. I am impatient and my friend who went with me is VERY impatient.... We are from out of town and were on vacation and even took the CTA to this place in the suburbs... ��We both had amazing hot dogs / sausages from here. The duck fat fries are amazing. Would we both do this again and wait in line? Absolutely! See Albert H. review below..."
"Within a few days of going to Simply It, I just had to go back. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Lincoln Park area. The food is authentic and DELICIOUS! There are so many different choice and all of them for a good price. The service is also WONDERFUL. The staff is very friendly, and you feel like you're at home. I strongly support this business and go back as often as I can. I highly recommend going to Simply it if you are in teh Lincoln Park neighborhood!"
go on a night the owner (Marty) is working- the kitchen is just better those nights than when he isn't there- that said the food is consistently good quality and fresh- lots of seasonal choices and the patio is also a plus when the weather cooperates...we have been here probably twenty or more times and are always glad to return
"Went here on my 25th birthday this past Fourth of July weekend (Thursday, the 3rd - while everyone else was looking at fireworks downtown) with friends from out of town and in town....loved it.The drinks at the bar are by far the strongest drinks I've had in Chicago so far, we were seated quickly once our entire party got there, and the food was SO GOOD. The atmosphere itself it by far the best thing about Carnivale....fun fun fun."
"I was really excited to eat here this past Saturday night. My good friend is a teacher at Lasalle 2 Elementary school just down Division so we strolled down there later in the evening. At some point during the day my friend was given a coupon from Fifty50 saying ""We support our Teachers!"" and it said come in for 40% off your entire bill. There was no fine print, no explanations as to what the specifics were. So we showed up ready to enjoy. Looking over the menu, I was shocked by all the accolades this place had gotten and was ready to try some of the food. When we presented the coupon however, the waitress said it only applied to the person with the coupon, even though everyone at the table was a teacher, but didn't have their CPS id's. This wasn't printed on the coupon and we were thoroug"
"We just went here for bunch, and it was amazing! ��We initially were told the wait to get in would be about 40 minutes (Sunday morning at 10), but they got our group of four in much quicker than that. ��There were lots of interesting choices on the menu, from the usual omlettes or two eggs and toast type options, to more adventurous choices like the giant tower of chocolate french toast. ��We will have to go back!"
"My husband and I were staying down the street at Hotel Indigo and asked for a recommendation for something close by for a late lunch. ��It was great! ��I had the curried chicken salad sandwich and my husband had the Cobb salad. ��Both were fresh and tasty, and best of all - served quickly! ��The staff was super friendly. ��The space is bright and inviting. ��It has that neighborhood place kind of feeling. ��We liked it so much we went back for breakfast the next morning. ��Great applewood smoked bacon. ��Terrific lox and bagel plate. ��I wish it was next to home - I would go all of the time!"
"Like the food but not love it. Not life-changing or mind-blowing but it was all very good. I love hot & spicy! Probably a lot more than most people so people telling me that the food was very hot & very spicy? Wrong.On second thought, the next time I should probably talk to the staff and ask my dishes to be made extremely spicy. The chocolate was amazing though!"
good Peking duck but service is bit slow and hard get their attention. other foods were bit salty.
"Touristy, but good food. I came here the first time when my out of town girlfriend and I were shopping on Michigan Avenue. I've brought a couple of out of town friends back and the reviews have all been positive. My husband and I went for brunch on Easter figuring most of the smaller brunch places would have insane waits and we were seated right away. Brunch is delicious. Not someplace I would go out of my way to eat at, but definitely a great place for friends and family when touring Michigan Avenue."
"Does that dunderwit from Cinci still own this place? ��If not, it's alright. ��There's a little bit of indie snobbery going on here. �� The furniture has lice. ��The bathroom is dirty. ��But they sure have good music, and they have the best cheesecake this side of...Ashland."
"The chilaquiles are so good that I dream about them. ��And the scones are even dreamier! ��I lived in the neighborhood and was a weekend regular. ��I have since moved away, but try to visit every time I am in town. ��When my last visit didn't coincide with a weekend, I wrote to the manager, who said she would arrange to have the chilaquiles (a weekend-only menu item) made especially for me! ��This kind of service, along with the great food and comfortable atmosphere, is what keeps me coming back. ��Thank you, Third Coast!"
"Wow.. had a ""sausage"" pizza delivered to my hotel.. I was told it was a ""sheet"" of sausage across the top of the pizza.. silly me.. I imagined it was generously crumbled or layer sausage-lets.. no no.. it was one solid piece of meat across the top of the pizza.. Sauce was cold and tasted undercooked.. I ate 3 slices because it took 50 ��minutes and I was starving.. threw the rest away.. be warned.. I have to get out of the midwest.. ick.."
"My absolute favorite hole-in-the-wall Chinese place.A little intimidating when you walk in because it can be confusing who you're supposed to be giving your order, but you'll get over it.Most everything I've ever had there is authentic and reminds me of home. They'll even make dishes upon request. I usually get Pan Fried Noodles with Char Siu and Chinese Broccoli...which is not on the menu. Love the Curry Beef Stew over rice. I do have to say though, the roast duck is just okay. I've had better. Sometimes I wonder how they're able to make a profit. I have to work very hard to order more than $12 worth of food so that I can use my debit card."
"WHAT WERE WE THINKING? We'd been going to a few different Middle Eastern style restaurants, more conveniently located to our home. Yet, none of them could compare to the the perfect Persian provender of Noon O Kebab! The food here is excellent. The Hummus and Baba Ghannouj were fresh, light, silky smooth and accompanied by just-from-the-oven naan. Next, we had the Koubideh combo: one skewer of seasoned ground beef and one of seasoned ground chicken, both flavor-filled, melt-in-your-mouth, meat treats! I threw in an extra lamb kabob, which was also throw-away-the-steak-knife tender and succulent. The kabobs were served with light and fluffy Persian white or dill rice and slightly charbroiled tomato wedges. The Baklava for dessert, was a nice, sweet night cap to this Persian fare. Additional"
"I waited a while to write this because I thought it must be a fluke--but this retaurant has the most consistent TERRIBLE SERVICE of anywhere I've ever eaten--I've wanted to yelp the last 3 times I've been there but held off--this morning was the last straw. ��I live nearby, and have probably been to Wilde 15-20 times since it's opened. ��I have never had good service, but the last 3 times were truly insulting. ��Today, my husband and I waited a full 7 minutes (in a nearly empty restaurant with busboys and waitresses walking around galore) and no one had even brought water. ��We got up and walked out, I promised myself I'd write this, and here it is. ��UNBELIEVABLE. ��The last 2 times before today, one in Feb, one in March, I literally had to get up and go find someone who worked there and ask if"
"Delicious food, great atmosphere. ��Enjoyed chatting with the other patrons about their impressions. ��Also liked knowing I was giving support to an establishment that prepares food that is from sustainable, human and ethical sources."
"Wow! My favorite place in the city. ��great atmosphere, even better food.The hamburger is my favorite burger in the city!!Locally grown, seasonal ingredients."
WOW Outstanding Im speechlessMake reservations
"We just held a happy hour/dinner for my 40th birthday at Sunda on a Saturday evening. ��And I can't say enough great things about Sunda for a large group!!! Everything from the food, to the atmosphere, to the service was spot on. ��Sunda worked with us to plan the perfect event for 25 people. ��Instead of a sit down dinner, we reserved the lounge and had a more casual party of passed appetizers/sushi and open bar for a set price per person. �� It was the perfect venue to allow everyone to mingle in a casual atmosphere. ��There was plenty of seating as well as room to stand. �� When we arrived at Sunda, we were immediately greeted with their amazing Peared Sake! �� The decorations and atmosphere in the lounge were warm & inviting. �� The tables even had personalized menus on them. �� A server walked"
"A friend took me to Le Colonial for the first time on 6/24 and it was definately one of the best dining experiences I have ever had! The waiter was wonderful, we relaxed with some delicious cocktails and a leisurely 4 course dinner. We shared everything and it was all delicious. My favorites were the salad with lotus root and tofu, the japanese eggplant and the whole red snapper."
"Tru ranks as my #1 meal ever eaten at a restaurant. No joke. I had a friend coming in from out of town and we both agreed to splurge on at least one dinner. She wanted something French and my boss the foodie recommended Tru. I loved the fact that they asked from the very beginning if there were food allergies. My friend has several allergies, one so severe that simply preparing other food with her allergic food could be bad. From the time we sat down at the table they offered a small palate cleanser and the dinner took off from there. Almost every portion of our meal had my friend commenting that it reminded her of her mother. When you think your mom is the best cook in the world and a restaurant meets and/or exceeds that standard, it can only mean something good. I tried their foie gras a"
not bad but way over rated
"My wife had seen glowing reviews for Bayless & this restaurant, so we tried it on a visit to Chicago in May 2011. What a disappointment. Our meal was overpriced (over $300 for party of 6) & skimpy. Worse yet, the food was very unauthentic (i.e., Americanized). It's so ironic because we had wonderful, reasonably-priced Mexican & Latin American food on the same trip at Loteria Grill in Los Angeles and at Nacional 27 in Chicago. They are everything that Frontera Grill should have been but was not. My advice--pass this place by & try a place with better food & reasonable prices (Nacional 27, Tango Sur or Rosebud on Rush)."
"My friends and I went for my birthday on a tuesday and were blown away by the service!!...very attentive, very knowledgeable. I would give the service and salad buffet 5 stars, but the meat only 3....most of the beef was too done for my liking, as well as salty and dry. The salad buffet was amazing, i should have just stuck with that. But if you want to be waited on well downtown...this is a good place to be."
"I recently tried Crisp for lunch. I had the Foodie's Choice Crisp, and my friend had a Buddha Bowl. Mine was delicious. The chicken was tasty, crisp, and tender on the inside. The sauce and toppings were also excellent. My only complaints were that the sandwich fell apart easily and it was just a bit too greasy. My friend enjoyed her Buddha Bowl, even though it was enormous. Seating is very informal but comfortable. I will definitely go back for more."
"I really like going to Greek Islands with my girlfriends. ��The waiters are so nice and make you feel like models every time we go. ��It is usually very crowded, so if you don't have a reservation you may have to wait a while before getting seated. ��The food is good we usually get the family meals so we get a little of everything. ��What I look forward to eating the most is the Taramosalata. ��It is the best!!! It is a Pink spread a blend of cod roe, potatoes, onions and olive oil. ��I spread it on the bread and it taste delicious. ��I usually call it the pink stuff because I cant pronounce Taramosalata."
"I came to Chicago to visit for business and decided to wait it out in the wind for an hour to sample some unique dogs. ��They must be good if people will wait in the wind and cold for 1 hour right? ��Absolutely right! I had the wild boar, alligator, and the classic Chicago dog. ��The wild boar was hands down the best hot dog I have ever eaten. ��The alligator was also delicious. ��The Chicago dog was the best I had on my trip to Chicago. ��If you haven't been there yet, GO!"
Really gone downhill comes to mind when I think of this place. ��I have fond memories of when it used to be good. ��I am hopeful.....Wishbone??
"I love this place! ��Great food with a great price!!! ��I love the falafels...best ever. ��And the lamb dinner has been my favorite. ��There is always a line but it goes fast. ��I've been eating here for about 5 years......and by the way, CASH ONLY."
Best pizza in Chicago. Done.
I have a gluten allergy and this restaurant had an amzing variety of items for me to choose from! The owner flies to Italy and visit different regions to pick out his wine! The veal ragu gluten-free pasta was amazing and I will be going back!
Great burgers.....great beer selection.....waitress was attentive and pleasant......wonderful experience. ��I will definately refer friends and be back myself even though it is a bit of a drive for me.
"The pasta is good and fresh, ��I love the outdoor patio out back. ��Inside during the winter it seems to get a little crowded and noisy as its kind of a tight space. ��Overall though, great solid Italian."
"I love me some hot dogs. ��Do you love hot dogs? ��Actually, I really don't care for hot dogs that much, but when you put fun things like blueberry Shiraz sauce on them and serve them with french fries fried in DUCK FAT, how could you NOT like them? ��This place holds strange hours, but I guess the owner can do that when people line up around the block in pouring rain just to come inside for some gourmet processed meat. ��This is a fun place to take visitors (ie parents, friends) for lunch on the weekends, but make sure they know that there WILL be a wait, and that seating is limited. ��Cash only!"
"The food is pretty good. ��We went here on recommendation of a few of our friends - not bad, not awesome. ��The skirt steak was pretty flavorful, the chimichurri sauce was ok and the portions were large. ��We'd return. ��Not anytime real soon. ��But we'd return nonetheless."
"The food was ok. The portions were generous but for the quality of food, it was way over priced. ��The only dish I've had here that I would try again is the salmon Kabob. ��The touch of dill on the rice is nice but over all I wasn't over impressed."
"Just moved to Chicago recently, stopped in here for brunch with some friends on Sunday. The food was really good and our waitress was OK, she seemed a little irritated but it was probably due to the table of messy five year olds next to us. I was also a little irritated by them. The only thing keeping this place from a 4-5 star rating is the incredibly poor alcohol selection and the long table wait!"
"All in all, I've gotta say I was a little disappointed. Sure, their food is good and would easily get 4, sometimes 5 stars in and of itself, but several thngs bothered me.We had reserved a table for 4 - when we arrived, we were treated in a pretty arrogant manner by the maitre d', who gave us a cramped table right next to the kitchen exit. I understand that this place demands proper attire and we weren't exactly wearing bow ties, but no shorts with wive-beaters either (think jeans and t-shirt or polo shirt). ?Since this was 6 weeks ago, I don't even recall what we had exactly, but I do recall that especially the starters, two salads were excellent and would have earned the place 5 stars easily. The main dishes were still good, mine, with chicken, was ?solid but not too extraordinary, the s"
"This place is absolutely worth a few visits if you like good beer and good food. I've been numerous times over the past few months.The beer: This is where they win your heart. They have a rotating menu of homemade and guest drafts, many of which are excellent, all of which are at least good. Find out what the seasonal beer at the time is and give it a try. After you've tried the seasonal and the main styles, try out their cask beers or the higher quality beers (e.g. bourbon stout, barleywine). I really enjoy their variety and they do excellent work.The food: There's a bit of a variety on classic bar foods and I've enjoyed everything I have ordered. My favorites are the Hombre burger, the duck fat popcorn and the Apple Pork Pizza. A rule of thumb - order something wild, there's no point in "
Yes. just four stars because there's zombies. Zombies who are waiting for duck fat fries and anything fried in duck. All those delicious sausages and hotdogs. I don't want to turn into a zombie and wait in line. Its a good thing I read through these reviews before dropping by. I planned by day so I could drop by during non-peak hours. No food is worth waiting two hours to get. Any place that causes a line to build up outside the shop needs to open another branch. Can I buy a franchise? I want to open shop and eat everything before its sold. Your menu to me is what brains are to a zombie.
"This is probably like the 2nd best food on my list and don't forget, it is FOREIGN:)"
"I am a picky eater so was a little nervous about eating at a Columbian food. Had the skirt steak (i know what your thinking not the best cut of meat) but it was fricken amazing! with it was two six inch long uncut pieces of calimari also amazing. Went on a Tuesday night for BYOB. Comfortable, casual, great service! The boyfriend had the NY strip, not as good but was still great. You must try this place!"
"If I could select no stars I would. ��This place is WHACK!!!! ��I'm sorry, let me qualify my statement. ��This place is WHACK if you go on the weekend, and you're hungry, and it's cold outside, and you like to have a little elbow room to eat your meal, and you like to have a server actually cares if you enjoyed your food. ��The food is okay but not worth going for all the details that make this place unbearable. ��I think the only people who really enjoy the Bongo Room are people who believe in their coolness so much that they would wear flip-flops on a cold day with a scarf and winter coat. ��What the mess??!!!"
Went on the last night of 5yr anniversary week... loved the Gage Fizz and the scallops. Can't beat the atmosphere.
Good bread and good polentaEverything else poor quality. ��Stuffed chicken was greasy and strangely spiced.Coupon for $50 off menu for $20 wound up costing an additional $33.00 for a total I'd $53.00 out of pocket.Will never go back and will unsubscribe Yelp for ridiculous 4 1/2 star rating of this restaurant .Also felt 18% tip for mediocre service was �� Over the top
"This place is pretty perfect. The food is great, staff is nice and the place is clean. ��We came on a Monday night when at least half the tables were occupied so it wasn't too busy or awkwardly empty. ��The host was really kind, gauged our background in Ethiopian cuisine and was ready to give us any introduction necessary. ��We shared the vegetarian messob and a couple appetizers. Each dish has its unique spices so flavors weren't too redundant and a real pleasure to share. The menu has some amazing options, definitely worth revisiting to plow through a little more of it."
"very authentic and very spicy!!!! ��the food here never fails to amaze me. if you decide to go, please don't be the average american dumbass by ordering egg rolls, fried rice & mongolianbeef . try the diced beef with tofu or the sour pickle fish soup. be adventurous, you won't be sorry... if china town is too much of a headache for you, the have a location in palatine on nw highway with plenty of parking & the same exact menu & quality.how tired i am of hearing who has the best damn eggroll. who cares!!!! good luck trying to find eggroll if you ever visit china as its NOT a traditional chinese food!"
"the goods.........open till late hours, the meat is great and side dishes are plentiful....the bads........at certain times , thw waiting can be annoyoing especially when u r hungry......your clothes smells like burned meat......overall its a great place to eat!"
"I brought my girlfriend here for our anniversary, and I'm delighted that I did.Atmosphere is incredibly romantic. Between the wine-bottle decor, low-but-sufficient candlelight, and live spanish guitar, the place oozes romance. Based on other reviews, I specifically requested a booth, which offered us lots of intimate privacy (at least visually -- I could hear conversation from the booth behind us pretty clearly, but not to the point of being bothersome), but looking out at the regular tables they didn't seem as crowded as other reviews had made them out to be anyway. Bonus: They had a nice card waiting on our table for our anniversary :-).Food was excellent. We both ordered premiere dinners, with come with a salad, cheese fondue, an main (oil) course with meat, veggies, and dipping sauces,"
Hands down the best taco spot! i love there taco's and there so quick on bringing you your food! My Pops brought me here like 6 years ago and i always come here on occasion.....Way better then the Pasadita across the street....don't snooze cuz you'll loose!
It's good - not great. ��I had the eggs benedict which they boast are the best in town but I could have made them better. ��They weren't bad...just nothing special. ��My husband had a skillet dish and it was average as well. ��The service was slow and our waitress never checked back with us once she delivered the food. ��Skip this place and go to the Bongo Room - amazing food that does not disappoint.
"I've been to Gilt several times and honestly I have never had a sub par experience. I have had the toast with bone marrow, & the toast with sweet balsamic (both incredible... the bone marrow is INSANELY good--foodies unite!), and I've had the roast chicken, the cornbread dish, the roasted cauliflower, etc. ��I have loved them all. ��The roast chicken is unbelievable--roasted garlic, espelette pepper, perfectly juicy and seasoned, it was great. The cornbread was to die for too. Plus the drinks are strong, like GOOD strong, yet well-balanced in flavor. They actually taste good, woo! ��If you want to ask for a specific bartender, ask for Zach to make your drinks. His service is wonderful and he has the mixology skills to match. I've never felt so special sitting at a bar before. And that is some"
I've been here in the past and remember loving it... But don't know what happened to just common politeness. Why have a hostess that is soooooo unwelcoming? Seriously... we expected to wait... but not be forgotten... when you tell someone 1 hour... Don't change it to 2 after we'd already waited an hour...rude and snooty... your food is just not that good... Definitely not a 2-hour wait good!
So far we have always done take out from this awesome Restaurant. Their Burritos are the greatest. We have tried all the different kinds of Burritos they have and all are very good. The chicken being our favorite. The delivery and pick up from the restaurant is speedy and they have always gotten are order 100% correct and we have ordered from them a dozen time now. They also have a very nice staff and the prices are amazing! Irazu is always a pleasure.
"The best Chinese food in the region, if not the country. Order the beef hot chili, rice noodle with ground pork, and the Szechuan wonton. Order the spicy cabbage if they don't automatically bring it. And the hot pot is one of the greatest culinary experiences you can have in the city. Do the hot pot. The table will be trashed when you're done, but in a good way. Do not, under any circumstances, ever order any Chinese-American style dishes. That is not what this place is about. This is the real deal."
"I love this place, but the line is ridiculous. ��Everyday is like this. ��I love the Duck Fat Fries, but it's only available on Fridays and Saturdays. ��I would give this place 5 starts if they would expand their restaurant and eliminate the long lines."
"I've been to Bucharest and this place doesn't even come close.Food was meh and way overpriced. My schnitzel tasted like a Tyson chicken patty. The Award Winning Sausage-Stuffed Chicken Thigh was dry.The service was fine. They were very attentive. As other Groupon users reported-I was auto charged a 20% tip. I think the owner must have an issue with people using Groupons because he gave us an incredibly hard time. On the Groupon voucher it says that you can show the restaurant the voucher on your phone. However, the owner insisted that I must have a hard copy in order to use it. After 30 minutes of back and forth we finally got it figured out. To be fair the owner was nice, but kind of a tech-idiot.Mediocre food. High prices. Tons of hassle. I won't be going back."
"If ANYTHING about this establishment was worth the money it charges, I'd understand it.Terrible drinks, terrible service, terrible prices."
"Sub par Chinese food. It all tastes the same, like the oil they use is over powering the food. Guess that's what happens when you use cheap ingredient"
Place is great from the food to the service is always top notch. ��I recommend the baba ganoush for starters followed by the Lamb or the chicken kabobs. ��For a great middle easter treat try Noon O Kabab.
Great place
BEST SAUSAGES in town! I recommend you go here before you expire!
"Not a fan of their sauce, and you can tell they don't specialize in thin crusts because it was nowhere near what it should have been. Definitely not my favorite pizza in the city of pizzas."
"If your looking for a good piece of pizza or some pasta this is the place to go. ��I just moved in down the street and my roomates and myself eat here 3 times a week. Their daily specials are unbelievable! $7.50 for a HUGE chicken parm with spaghetti, $2.50 meatball sandwiches, $5.50 meat ravioli and the best part is they all come with soup or salad. ��It's not going to be the best you ever had but I assure you its very tasty and well worth the money."
"meh-ybe if there was a place like the new places in wicker park that are out of place in logan square meh-king it even more out of place that would be awesome. there was so little of this place that felt like it was in place, of place, the stained glass windows towards the back were kind of awesome but then there was the rest of the place that just was not working all together. BEER: I tried the cross of gold on this my first visit. When do first impressions end and second thoughts begin? The beer was served in an interesting glass, had four or so hemispheric longitudinal protrusions. A wheaty and hoppy enough picture. This was described as a golden ale I believe. ��The place was crowded-ish. most of the space felt very designed for something, in the sense that there really didn't seem to b"
"I went to Nazareth Sweets to buy baklava, so I decided to stop here to buy dinner. I ordered the lamb kabobs and a small order of hummus. The food was very delicious and filling. But I do think it's overpriced by a buck or two. The dill rice is great, and you're given enough to feed two or three people. Although it seemed to be more of a carry-out place, ��I will definitely try this place again. I'd write more, but I'm too stuffed. :)"
My girlfriend and I go here all the time. Its the best deal if you'd like to share a meal for one person (we can never finish them for two). Ethiopian Diamond can get pretty expensive (special occassion expensive) if you want to add on drinks and appetizers that's why we prefer Demera over Ethiopiam Diamond. The food at Demera isn't quite as good as Ethiopian Diamond because they're lamb and other meat dishes are hit or miss. If you like black injera you can order it ahead of time and they'll serve your meal with it. ��The honey wine is delicious and they make their own which they open on Fridays so get there before the weekend is over because they run out quickly. They do have bottled honey wine that should suffice if the run out of the home brew. One thing we've noticed is that the night 
"I love this place, and i go here at least 3-4 times a month. Some meats are too salty, but i don't blame the resturant. The chef's hand probably slipped. This server who was moved to Miami's location used to serve me all the times. And i always tipped him $50. After that, i still kept tipping $50 to every server of mine. But not long ago i went there and it was only 2 of us. At the end, when the check came the guy had charged me a 15% service fee. That angered me. For a resturant going to high places such as this, they should train their eimployees well enough to understand respect. Yeah, service charger, for tabels above 6 people is understandable. But for 2, sad. I still left the guy extra $50. Maybe he'll learn something that way."
"Delicious steak, and great service. ��The place makes you feel like you are in Las Vegas...but I guess that has to do with the fact that it's an East Coast Chain. ��Very different from the other Chitown steakhouses.Leave room for dessert though, because they are famous FAMOUS for their butter cake. ��It's amazing, no joke, and a huge portion, topped with ice cream. ��Don't miss out on this aspect of the experience. ��They also have a live piano player and singer most times. ��I ate dessert ON the piano with my date (using the piano as a table, no laying on it!)Worth checking out."
all i can say is i felt like a mayan god wonderful food steak cooked to perfection this is what its like to be a mayan god
"I do dine out alot and this is one of my favourite. The staff are friendly, food is amazing....I would definitlely recomment this to friends and family!!"
I went to Wildfire with my wife and must comment on their incrusted Halibut it was delicious! Definately a must have. ��Only bad part is that it is seasonal. ��But I will be back to order i!
"My first experience at piccolo sogno ��was nothing spectacular, I was actually really disappointed. I returned last night for restaurant week and decided to give it another shot. I was blown away by the food. The service I have to say needs improvement, our reservations were for 7:30 and we were finally seated at 8:00pm. After having to wait a half an hour to be seated, all I wanted was a glass of wine. Our waiter took another another 20 min just to bring the menus and another 10min to bring the wine... The service was pretty frustrating, that is why I am not giving 5 stars. Now for the positive feedback, I ordered the green and white paglia e fieno con vitello.. ��which was a handmade pasta, very similar to a fettuccine in a light veal meat sauce!! all I have to say is WOW!! it was so fresh"
"My husband and I went here for our wedding weekend. Very cute layout, but I don't like the fact that everyone needs to arrive at the same time...5PM. That's a little early for dinner. Food wise, not bad. But when they have the bread and fruit appetizer as the starter, they don't give you an option for anything but a swiss based cheese...which tasted like it was mixed with wine. Not very flavorable. Main course, they use an oil base rather than water (some people don't care, but just something you may want to know when you're soaking all your veggies and meats in oil!). The only reason I didn't give this place a higher rating is because they do not give you options for cheese or chocolate and all that. I'm still happier with Melting Pot."
good food. Didnt like the setting plan. but in a whole i would say its good enough to return.
"Great place, never enought hunger to eat all that food. Love it!"
"Checked them out a couple of weeks ago.Food was good and the beer selection was also above average.The decor was really nice as well.The downside:Long wait for tables and open seating in the bar area, so everyone is circling the table like vultures.The bar tables are so close together thet you feel like a jerk squeezing between the table when you get up to use the bathroom.Would go back though!!"
"By far my favorite restaurant in Greektown, Artopolis makes the best soup I've ever tasted. Notice I didn't say soups - only order the good soup, lemon chicken - if you refer to the lemon chicken soup simply as the good soup they will know what you mean. The alternative is usually dreadful. If you find yourself trying to decide between the Artopita or pizza, always go Artopita."
"I ordered the thin crust last night, while the toppings (Sausage and Mushroom) were delicious, i wasn't overly impressed. ��The outter pieces were must better than the inner ones as the crust wasn't even substantial enough to stay together-it fell apart quite easily. ��After reading all the reviews I'll opt for the deep dish next time."
"This place is my FAVORITE Vietnamese food! ��The people are super nice, the prices are very reasonable and most importantly, I haven't had a single thing there that I didn't LOVE! ��Every time I come here with my friends (VERY frequently) we are greeted by the owner and when we leave he always makes sure to shake our hands and tell us thank you!I highly recommend going here for the lunch specials! ��I don't know where else you can get a drink, salad, soup, appetizer (spring roll), Banh Mi (most delicious Vietnamese sandwiches) and fruit for under $7! ��This past time I was there, a friend and I ordered one of the soups to share and it was DELICIOUS and the presentation was so wow that people were stopping and looking at our table through the window as they were walking by! ��Another friend that"
"This isnt my first review of Grand Lux, but it'll be my last.We've been probably 20 times since it opened. When it was new, it was so very nicely done, with items on the menu that were definitely more ambitious than the Cheesecake Factory, and pretty well done. Never had an item I didnt think was well executed. Unfortunately, all that is over. I cant tell any difference between Grand Lux and the Cheesecake Factory as to the level of the food. And whereas they used to prepare it well....it's definitely gone downhill. Mediocre. Grand Lux has been packing in the crowds for 3 years now and the wear and tear is showing. Two large pieces of wallpaper were dangling from the wall going up the escalator-amateurish attempts to stick it back up with scotch tape had failed. Light fixtures were a littl"
"Sassy is sooooooooooo sassy; the best creation every. ��Healthy food, delicious chicken, resonable $, unbeatable. ��One problem: they don't deliver to North Carolina boo-hooo."
"This place is for a certain mood. Great drinks, small private group. Its not vibey. Bring good conversation and your pocketbook."
Oui! Oui! This joint is off the chain. This was my first encounter with French food and I have to say I'm glad it was with Bonsoiree. The restaurant is comfortable and the staff is super friendly. The menus are prearranged which is a great way to try multiple specialties. Everything from the flavor to the presentation was grade A. This is a great date restaurant. Check it out!
the place is cute and inviting . we got falafels and lentils soup they were just ok .. the service is so flat. i still prefer much better baba pita falafel .and pita in lentil soup.
"ok. first things first! ITS DARK GLOOMY AND NOISEY? Who wants to eat in that kind of atmosphere. ��Second who eats that kind of food? Bone marrow, and wild boar? ��yucky! �� yahh this place just not the kind of place for me. ��it seems just so akward..."
This is a great place to go with a group and share dishes. The sushi rolls are some of best in the city.
"Best place ever to get a dog! ��I went with three friends and we ordered about 8-10 sausages. ��They were all great. ��I liked some better than the other, like the lingui�_a with saffron and manchego. ��We also, went for the duck and foie sausage because you have to! ��The corn dog melted in my mouth. ��I don't even like corn dogs- i think i am hooked for life, and only for $1.50. ��The line wasn't to bad- right to the edge of the door. �� The line moves quickly, and its well worth it."
"I had eaten here before for dinner, not a fan. ��Today went here for brunch. ��Pretty darn good. ��I have always been a fan of the decor. ��Dark and regal looking. ��But the dinner menu was not that impressive. ��Brunch menu today very good, nice variety and everyone in our party was happy. ��Now fix your dinner menu!"
"I work near Fox & Obel, so I frequent it on occasion. Its caf�� is decent but nothing to rave about. I heard from a colleague that they serve a great tuna melt sandwich, but I have yet to try it for myself. As for the grocery side of things, it's way overpriced. But the store's warm lighting makes it inviting to browse, especially on a cold autumn day. I mainly go there for my occasional guilty (expensive!) pleasure: plucking up B��quet caramels--you must try the Celtic sea salt ones. Mmm!"
"I have heard nothing but great things about Chicago q. So i had to try it. And I'm sorry to say, I did not enjoy them. I loved the chips and tea, but other than that, I will not go back. The food was bland to me and my family. Maybe its because we are black and we are used to bbq tasting a certain way.? I don't know. This food is perfect for a diabetic. Seriously the chicken wings were good. But the pork chop, and ribs were not good. And i absolutely hated the mac n cheese...... Yuck. Bland, bland, bland. A no-no for me."
"I don't go as regularly but I definitely recommend this place whenever I can. ��It's casual, the food is fresh and the crowd is always upbeat. ��Great customer service even when they are obviously running around busy and the the whole place is packed. ��Some favorites are the tostones with mojo, the simple palmito salad and the very juicy steak sandwich."
"I've been here multiple times now and each time is more disappointing then the previous visit. After coming back from a recent trip to Italy and have great experiences, the pizzas here at Spacca are bland. Another reviewer described it as pita like and would agree. The service is generally good overall, but in the last visit, we felt rushed. Every 3-4 minutes someone came by asking are you done? can I take your plate? When I'm holding a piece of pizza in my hand eating it, figure it out - I'm not done eating. I don't think I'll be back."
We had a nice time. Cool retro theme. Friendly car hop service and a dog with a nice snap to the casing. I must say it is on the pricey side though. You are definately paying for the upkeep of the place in the price of the dog.
"WOW...I was very impressed with Glenn's. We went on a Tuesday for the All-you-can-eat crab leg special. The legs were as big as my arm...I think they made money on me, because 3 was my limit, THEY ARE HUGE!!! And, the service was great, they were very attentive to when we needed more legs, a refill of a drink, etc. Very good place."
I enjoyed this wine bar with 2 of my friends on a trip to Chicago. The wine list impressive. The servers were knowledgeable. The noise level was almost intolerable.
"I keep coming to xoco in hopes that I have a memorable experience, but every time it's just slightly above average. Their pozole is quite bland and I've had better tortas at many different Mexican restaurants. But the guac is really good."
"My favorite restaurant in Chicago! ��I have been here about twenty times and I have never had a bad experience. ��Whenever my parents come into town, they insist that we go to Geja's. ��Expect to spend quite a bit as it is a bit pricey, but well worth it and they have a very good wine selection. ��We always wait for a booth as the tables are in the middle of a very narrow walkway and I was always getting bumped into when I sat there once, so now, I just wait for a booth every time. ��The bar is a decent place to wait and have a glass of wine. ��This is the best place to bring a date as it is dimly lit and they have a Flamenco guitar player to add to the atmosphere to go along with the delicious fondue and good wine.The only negative I can think of is how my clothes smell when I leave."
"The food was excellent--had the ropa vieja and the yuca rellena for an appetizer. Cozy back patio (enclosed), very attentive and friendly service. Very reasonable prices and BYOB. ��We LOVED this place and will definitely be back."
"No take out, no delivery - it'd damage the pizza. ?If you like this type of specialty pizza - wood burning oven, high quality ingredients, this place is great. ?And the appetizers are great too - hard to choose, and all so yummy! ?I'm originally a New Yorker, and am VERY picky about my pizza. ?I love the pizza here - the toppings are top-notch, and the crust is done perfectly and oh so yummy! ?As for the restaurant - I have a feeling this place would work equally well for a casual I feel like pizza tonite, lets walk over night as it would for a solo meal, a casual gathering of friends, or a date nite. ?It definitely seems like it could be whatever you want it to be that occasion."
"I really enjoyed this place. It was really delicious. The meat just ��KEPT coming and coming at the flip of a card..beef lamp,chicken pork It was seasoned just right. I cannot say enough . IT was superb. The only reason I did not give this restaurant a 5 star is due to the high noise level and the fact that it was quite crowded. Anyway I will be back!! Great place to bring family and guests!! You will not be disappointed.."
"I was absolutely not happy with this place. Even though we made it perfectly clear to the waiter that we don't eat pork and we asked him for recommendations for the appetizer, we still received appetizers with pork inside. As a person who recently moved to the USA, I had no idea that chorizo was a type of pork sausage. And since we had told the waiter that we don't eat pork, we pretty much trusted him with his recommendations. Thank god the appetizers arrived after our Russian friend came, because she was the one to tell us that it was pork!! When we told this to the waiter, he confirmed that we had told him that we don't eat pork and he also confirmed that chorizo had pork in it! Honestly, after having a start like that, happy that my friend arrived early, I just lost my whole appetite!"
This is my favorite place to come for breakfast in Chicago. ��Everything I've ordered from here has been great. ��From Oatmeal to French toast they do it right. ��Service is sometimes spotty but for the most part they are on it. ��Food always comes out fast and even though they are packed on the weekends I never have to wait to long for a table. ��Go check them out. ��You can't go wrong.
"Great food and great atmosphere! My wife and I went here for our anniversary and we were not disappointed. The food is quite pricey and the quantity was a bit disappointing, but the quality is unmatched. My wife is not a seafood eater, but I got here to try some lobster and she was amazed of the flavor. She had the filet and was very happy with it. Thanks to Shaw's I may be able to get my wife to eat seafood again:)"
"Hands down my favorite restaurant. I have been coming to this place for more years than I care to remember. Always a great experience,great food and massive portions. You can eat for at least 2 extra days.Angelo and Enzo are great and always so welcoming-like you are coming to their home."
"Great great restaurant. All around a good meal and good time. ��Ended with an incredible dessert and some coffee. ��Waiters were very knowledgeable and they had personality, ��Will go back for more!"
"Bongo Room would be okay if it wasn't for the hype. I mean the food is good but it's just breakfast food. I mean it's pancakes not Sushi. I really dont understand why people wait for so long to get in here. Maybe just not enough other options. Its cute inside and you can get a $9 Mimosa. Unfortunately, they hire servers at the same place as Feast and Big Star. Is there a service out there i dont know about called mean hostile servers for hire."
OMG soooo good! This is my favorite place in Chicago/Lakeview!Its a MuSt try!
"After two weeks of calls (the answering machine is routinely full) my girlfriend was able to get us a reservation for the night of my birthday. ��She spent the day selecting and then decanting three wines. ��Our reservation was for 5:30 p.m on a Friday. �� At 4:40 or so the phone rings and it is Schwa. ��Like so many other people who have posted here, we were simply told that the Chef would not open that evening. �� We are in shock. �� They promise to call on Saturday to find another time for us to come in. ��They do not call. ��Never did. While others seem content with this behavior (Chef apparently does this on a regular basis) I think it is terrible. ��No one would put up with a band that cancelled concerts at the last minute -- and without explanation. ��Perhaps Chef is an artist -- but he seems"
I LOVE this place. I have never had a poor experience here. The staff is really nice and the presentation is always fantastic. The food is delicious and fairly priced. I usually cannot eat sushi of any kind but they have a really good mango and avocado roll that I cannot resist. The will also use rice paper by request if you aren't keen on seaweed. I think everyone should go here.
"It is not often we make the journey to Chicago from NW Indiana. ��But we did tonight to wrap up some errands in Chi-Town. We found SUNDA on the way back from another famous restaurant (with a 3 - 4 hour wait) and decided to try it. ��It delivered big time. ��Creative and delicious sushi rolls, salads and some interesting fusion dishes gave us reason to plan a repeat visit. ��The quality and freshness coupled with reasonably pricing and expert service makes me think the 65 min drive is well worth it.We did try lots and were pleasantly surprised. ��Bring ear-plugs - it was on the LOUD SIDE."
"I used to love this place years ago, but they continue to disappoint me everytime I walk in nowadays. ��The service has gotten fairly unfriendly, the food mediocre, and the drinks are usually not nearly strong enough. ��Although I will say that the salsa there is amazing and very refreshing."
"i love my meats, i like this place a lot. very nice ambiance, nice people.recommend it!"
"Notice how most all the reviews from california are 2's and 3's?Notice how most of the 4's 5's are from chicago and suburbs? While a few people from Chicago also bring in the 2's and 3's and some really horrible ones that saw a rat or cock roach. They aren't just saying that to be mean...I take it those few DO know what good mexican tastes like, and this like many others I have seen on yelp is NOT good. Is it called mexican? Sure. Is it pretty cheap? Yes... Is it *good* mexican? no way!!The more and more I look on yelp, I keep getting the feeling looking at this review, and several others, that people here just don't know what good mexican food tastes like! That or they are always drunk when they go to eat it. Now Chicago of course has some amazing food, but the taquerias I have found are "
"Amazing. You can't put the experience into words, so I won't try. It's best seen/felt/tasted in person. It is an invesment of course, but well worth it. You are paying not only for the high quality food, but the presentation and flawless service."
"I just ate here and I wonder what's with these Brazilian Steakhouse Salad bars? I'm not complaining but is it me or does it look like the vegetables should be included in the Mitchell Report? I swear they are on Growth Hormones or something, because the asparagus and all the other vegetable treats are way bigger than the ones you find at Jewel!Anyways, this place rocks! It's been consistently great everytime I've gone there. If you are a first timer, I must warn you that once you go orange, the guys will come by every 5 seconds with something to offer you! My advice start with 2-3 meats you want (plus the pineapples, my favorite), then flip the thing to black so you can enjoy eating in piece then flip it over again to get more. It's quite hard and almost disturbing to eat with a constant f"
"This place best asset is the BYOB. ��The prices make up for loss of alcohol revenue so when it comes down to it, the food has to be awesome and it does fall short. ��I used to love this place, but with the prices for pasta going for $20 you certainly might consider paying for your wine and going somewhere else. ��I guess if you are in the mood for seafood, this can still be a decent option. ��I only wish that the owners were Italians so they can taste what's lacking."
"Good food, good views"
Went to Spacca Napoli with Windy City Pizza Club. Excellent service and good pizza!
I Went to Glens for the first time a couple weeks ago for lunch and I was blown away . The staff was super friendly and the food was fantastic! OMG the clam chowder was wonderful and the Lobster Roll was to die for . If you are looking for a nice little place to get fresh seafood for a reasonable price look no further that GLEN's !
"The Bongo Room absolutely has the best breakfast in Wicker Park. I would wait over an hour for this place, it's that good. The veggie croissant is amazing and their pancakes are always incredible. It's worth the price and the wait, every time."
"Worst experience ever. The bar was half empty yet we still waited for 30 minutes with a rude doorman. After being seated we waited another 25 minutes for a waitress to come and help us. She was was also rude and uninformative. 20 minutes and several complaints later she informed us that each drink takes 15 minutes to make. We left the establishment prior to recieving our drinks 1 hour after we arrived at a place that was NOT busy.I highly recommend you NOT go to this place unless you are looking for a night of bad service, rude pretentious people (without the class to back it up), and mediocre decor. TWO THUMBS DOWN."
"Chilean sea bass----one of the top 5 fish meals I have ever had!So delicate, light and delicious- I will be back!!"
"Everyone knows this is the best Mexican restaurant in Chicago. ��When I visit Frontera I expect really good food, in addition to great service, and it meets my expectations everytime.The margaritas and sampler appetizer plate are definite musts when visiting Frontera."
"I cannot say enough good things about Kinzie Chophouse. ��I work in the area and I really enjoy the atmosphere and the staff. ��The steaks are out of this world. ��The staff will bring a tray of meat by your table to show off their selection. ��I am a total foodie and this place is tops in my book! Right now they are doing a winter menu - 3 course dinner for $20.00 - AMAZING!! Check it out, you will love it! Cheers!"
"We went last Saturday. The place was packed, but it was the Valentine's Day weekend so no suprise there. We had calamari for starters and for main I had shrimp ala capri- I love this dish. It came witha lot of extras too. Salad bar, soup, coice of side- just great.The one thing I don't like the LaVilla for is that I have never tried their desserts- I'm just too full after dinner to even look at the menu. Good place!!Friendly staff. Good food!! And great pizza too."
"Don't Go There!I ate a chicken sandwich there about two days ago. Not only was the staff UNBELIEVABLY condescending, arrogant and rude while serving it to me- I became deathly ill last night with food poisoning. Again- DONT GO THERE!"
I had ordered catering from here for my wedding anniversary. The owner had took my order over the phone. This man was so sweet and helpful towards me. The food had came on time and it was still fresh and hot. He had also gave us an extra half tray of tiny little egg rolls. How nice of him. It was crunchy and so good. What I loved most was that everything was in such a good portion but the price range didn't dig deep into my pockets. If I could I would give this place more than 5 stars. I would really love to stop by after I have my baby. I will definitely visit the restaurant in the near future.
"One word: Salsa!It can get super busy, which is great because it means everything is always fresh."
"We have been to Opart Thai four times. The first two times they fooled us. Food was actually pretty good and service was fair. The third time, food was terrible and service was terrible. Finally, went again yesterday to give them another try. It will be the last. First when we were seated, we were seated in the worst location. In the corner by the front door. There were multiple open seating and when asked about an alternative, the person seating us stated we have that one (pointing over to a great table in front of the windows), but he states I will have to clean it first and then paused without offering to do that. It was clear he was not planning on cleaning the table. We were then seated at the bad location, when we then spotted a cockroach crawling on the ledge right behind my head. I"
"I don't know much about Hungarian food but it seems that Little Bucharest serves traditional dishes with a twist. We started with the smoked salmon appetizer, which was quite salty but pretty good. ��The potato pancakes were the star of the appetizer -they were more crepe like with a wonderful texture - ��yet tasted like they were made completely out of potatoes. ��My husband had the goulash, which was a well done version of braised beef in a tomato based sauce accompanied by gnocchi �� We both loved the chicken schnitzel even more, even though it is basically fried chicken patties. But these were perfectly crispy and sat on a bed of nicely pan crisped horseradish spaetzel with a little red pepper cream sauce. ��Based on how great the potato pancakes were, we decided to get chocolate crepes for"
Playful and delicious menu. Service is top notch. It was easy to get a reservation. It is clear there is a lot of heart and soul that went into coming up with this menu. The food is as innovative as the concept of the menu. 5/5 for a fanstatic new chicago edition.
"The food is good, but honestly we can get better food around Chinatown with less expensive prices. I would give this restaurant more stars but their service is bad. During the times we've been there, the servers were rude, impolite and blatantly disrespectful of their customers and when serving or handling our food. One time we ordered a whole steam fish. As tradition, when asked, the server will help to cut up the fish and serve. However, when asked, one server didn't want to do it and he asked this other server. This man totally massacred the fish and later chucked the silverware on the plate and left. He then started laughing with the other server that was too lazy to do it. Honestly, where are your manners and we should have called the manager and asked for a refund or what so ever, bu"
"My favorite place for kabobs in Chicago. This place serves amazing food. And now that they've expanded a bit, the wait isn't too bad. The only reason I didn't give the full 5 stars is that the service isn't very consistent. I've had good service sometimes, and other times our server has been just awful. But the food is always good and I will always drive across the city to have it. Ribeye and shrimp combo is my usual. The lamb shank is also really good."
"Irazu is super dank.here is why1 the new host is super hot2 the wait staff is awesome and super personable with all its customers3 the food is outragiously good and can fit anyones budget4 comedic appeel,those drivers are hilarious,one is like the ugly version of carlos mencia5 did I mention the hot new host?6 the foodAll in all this place is great which is why I gave 5 stars"
"I went here not know what to expect and now wish I could go again and appreciate it more. It's hidden away in the North district, up a discreet place. Pretty nice sized, and all the other diners, except our group, were Japanese when I was there. This place is all about the food, there are no gimmicks as with so many otherseafood places in Chicago. The decor is discrete which makes this place feel very authentic, in addition of course, to the fantastic food."
I went here for dinner last night and loved it! ��I had the lemon grass beef appetizer (big enough for 2-3 people) and the claypot catfish. ��Everything was really good and the service was wonderful. ��BYOB - I'll definitely be back!
"All I can say is OMG! The margaritas are fresh and delicious, the appetizers unbelievable (ceviche trio) and the entrees...I enjoyed and savored every single bite. (carne asada and mole) Book your reservations far in advance, otherwise you might not get a chance to dine a the Frontera Grill. It is worth doing a little planning in advance!"
"Great if you like overpriced tiny portions. The food was pretty good and service was great but for good tapas with real portion sizes, go to Cafe Iberico"
"I've been in love with Rick Bayless since I saw him on Top Chef Masters. I've never had a chance to visit the famous Frontera, so when I found out about this little restaurant he opened, I was very excited to try it! Let me tell you, it lived up to all of my expectations :)First of all, it's adorable, inside and out. I love the facade with its white and blue awnings and the lettering on the windows--it's playful, colorful, and inviting. I wish I lived closer by, because I would swing by every day for a cup of the Aztec Hot Chocolate, which has chile and allspice in it for a fantastic kick! And the churros, which are perfectly done, airy and light and crispy, are only $1.50 each! On second thought, maybe it's better I don't live too close!I went on a Wednesday, and their daily special torta"
"Conveniently located on Michigan Ave. A classy place, with superb service. A bit over priced to my taste and a bit loud ... Otherwise, good food and service."
"I used to love this pizza, but they recently spread out the dough farther to make the pies bigger (allowing them to cut 8 slices instead of 6 per pie), which in turn made the pizza thinner. There are still great ingredients on top, don't get me wrong, but the consistency of the crust makes it much less tasty than it once was. I used to eat there every day, but now have returned to a semi-normal life of buying groceries. Maybe it's a good thing. Now I don't spend so much money on their reasonably priced food, and am learning how to cook once more.Thanks, Fogo.I give them 4 stars for the food (chicken is still a great deal) but take off a star for disappointing me so. The owner did indeed seem unsympathetic to my complaints.~bitterfogolover"
we enjoyed everything!
"This place probably has the most attractive waiters I have ever seen. I had the Philly Cheeze Steak sandbo and it was awesome. I also had a mean Banana PB shake that was so rich and creamy I didn't want to share it. Lastly, the Banana Split cake was super good. Moist and full of flavor. The price is pretty neat and the diner seems to always be busy meaning they have incredibly fresh ingredients."
"Let me preface by saying I had a short stint in NJ. The prices for the quality and quantity of food out there are jawdropping. The food here is pretty darn good tood, the only thing that is lacking is service. Yes, i know this is pretty much it when it comes down to Cuban food. That doesn't mean you have keep your nose so darn high. First time I stopped in I shook it off as the person behind the counter is having a bad day. Second time around got the same snippity attitude. If it wasn't because food is pretty good and I enjoy having different latin flavors besides mexican food I probably wouldn't be so kind."
"They really have let them selves go... although they can now afford the interior and extra room, the food quality is no longer the same as 3-5 yrs. ago... Pitta INN blows this place out of the water in many aspects. Who ever gives 5 stars doesn't know great middle eastern food."
"A hophead living in Chicago for over five years, I finally decided to take a group of friends to Hopleaf for the very first time. ��The four of us walked in at 6:30 and were seated immediately, which was a pleasant surprise. ��The draft beer list was good, but certainly not the best I've ever seen. ��I had a Bell's Two Hearted and my wife, an Allagash White.We skipped appetizers as nothing looked particularly appealing and moved directly to two orders of Mussels for two. ��Mussels are my latest obsession and these did not disappoint. ��I will say, however, that the mussels offered at Logan Square's Revolution Brewing we far more fresh and the sauce much more nuanced in flavor. ��Nonetheless, I ate to my hearts content.By the end of the meal I could sense that the restaurant was getting busy. ��Du"
"Everyone needs to try Korean BBQ once in their life. Go with a large group this to this place and take part in the eating/bbq-ing experience. Everything comes with these little side dishes to share. Different vegetables, noodles, meat etc. The dumplings are very tasty as is the plum wine. I did get a headache from all of the smoke. Avoid wearing anything that needs to be dry cleaned because of the bbq smoke smell it will have. Also you have to take your shoes off, so consider that into your outfit decision as well. I was wearing boots and it was just akward."
"The staff and food were amazing. ?I added a note on my reservation and they were very accommodating. ?The waiter was great and the buss boys were at times too aggressive on cleaning the table. ?That is better then the bus boys not showing up at all I guess. ?The place was buzzing all night the atmosphere was great. Overall a great experience but the only thing that I could say negatively is that I should of gave the Valet guy my ticket to get my car when I ordered desert, what's the deal long wait for the car........either way it was a amazing night. ************** THE SEA BASS A MUST HAVE ************************"
"I love pho and wanted to try banh mi again. We got the beef brisket and bible tripe pho, it was a big bowl of broth but not enough noodles or beef for my liking. Very fragrant and delicious, though. For the banh mi we got the coconut curry chicken, which I was disappointed to find out was not in sandwich form. The French bread came uncut, and we ended up just ripping up chunks of it and dipping it in the curry. Not the sandwich experience I wanted; probably my own fault for not knowing better. The plum bubble tea I ordered didn't taste like plum at all - it was just a purple sugary drink. It tasted like bubble gum ice cream, which would be good if it's what I was looking for."
When I cam here it weas because my boyfriend at the time wanted to try some Vegetarian cuisine instead of the same ol same ol in the Kitchen. We definitely loved our time here .Very friendly staff the food (kinda small) but tastey and the Milkshakes Yummmmmmyyyy to die for. The fries arent TO DIE FOR..but the trip here is well worth it .I think you could fool a meat eater into thinking something on the menu is Vegan lol.
good dogs! ��THE fries are the best
"The best mussels and frites in town!!!! ��The ONLY reason why I gave a 4 star instead of 5 was because they didn't carry any Czech beer! ��What a bummer but the food was fantastic, the crowd was great. ��The ambiance is to die for. ��I would eat mussels and frites there every day if can!!! Love it!"
"This was my 2nd dining experience at Sunda. ��The food this time around was incredibly disappointing. ��The sashimi was not as fresh so it did not melt in your mouth. ��The fried items were VERY greasy i.e. toast and jam/loompya. ��The rolls were decent but 1 was over sauced, forget trying to use chopsticks. The cookie sampler dessert was inedible, should not be on the menu...My expectations given the price and reputation of this restaurant were not met. ��Skip it, too many great trendy restaurants choices in Chicago at this price point."
"I have never been to Costa Rica but if the food here is this good than I need to visit. This place was scrumptious. From the potato tacos, yuca with garlic oil and then the steak burrito. Wanna try a different kind of shake? then try the blackberry, it's different.If your in the mood to try a different kind of food meaning other than the typical, chinese, mexican or indian, (you get what i'm saying?) then try Irazu"
"Great atmosphere, food, and pricing! Wait time is what kept me from giving the Lux all 5 stars. Be prepared to wait a while for a table."
"Lucky I did not know how to put 0 starts ....I am french, I know what fondue is.... and ��It's nowhere near this awfull, smelly, creamy, orange mixture, in which you get to dip the stupidest ingredients such as soft bread or grape !I was ashamed I went with friends to whom we had to explain that this is really not what it should be. When we cooked it at home for them, it was like a revelation, I doubt they'll be back there anytime.And that's only talking about the food...What about the terrible smell ? As soon as you are back home you need to get rid of every piece of clothes you had been wearing and run in the shower wash your hair .. maybe that's what makes it a famous date place ...I could keep writting, but I guess you get the point: DON'T GO ... ever !"
"Waited for about an hour and finally got a chance to taste Rick's food and I'm sad to say that it was middle of the road. Had the margarita at the bar while I waited which was amazing but when I ordered it from our server when we got sat, the taste and presentation was different. The service might need some attention but I'm more disappointed with the food that was served. I can't believe that I paid so much for so little. The taste from my epanadas was off and the margarita needs some consistency. Sad but will try again another time"
"I will keep this short and sweet - this is one of the best finds in Chicago. VERY reasonably priced meal options with well sized portions. The staff was attentive and knowledgable. The food was so delicious and I can not wait to go back. Get the deconstructed bloody mary fish entree. I ��know, sounds bizarre, but so good!!!!!!!"
"DANNNGGG!!!! THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE!!! Give me more! Buddha Bowl- Rice, veggies, choice of meat, hot sauce, sesame oil- my mouth is watery and my stomach is satisfied!Placed my ordered, got my food, ate my food- in under 30 minutes. Cash only"
"Since I'm Cajun, it was a real pleasure to discover Big Jones. It's what some would call Bonafide. I have not had such a true and satisfactory gumbo since I left Lafayette, my previous attempts at Heaven on Seven leaving me feel like my kind has been turned into a Disney attraction for tourists. They also make delicious cornbread like you won't find anywhere outside of the deep south, with white cornmeal and only the natural sweetness of good cornmeal and no sugar. Their beignets are not the same as you would get at one of the tourist spots in the French Quarter, but I thought they were spot on and a great start to our brunch. By the way, if you've never had a bowl of gumbo and a sazerac first thing in the morning on a hangover, you have not lived, my friend."
"It does not get any better than this. Went to supper last night. The restaurant is beautiful, the lower bar is small and quaint. Great drinks. specialty drinks...especially the Caliente.The menu is diverse and the food is very good. Portions could have been a liitle larger. The service staff from hostess, to bartender to server to busman was 5 star.Mercat is going to be a hit in Chicago. Making reservations for next weekend."
"I was in for lunch on Tuesday ��to treat one of my Clint's for lunch , and had the lunch special, it was the best steak I have had for lunch in a very long time, i was amazed but not surprised by everything i saw just he way it was recommended to me by a Friend, ��the dining room looked like home away from home, it all started from the first minute i entered in the house, we where welcomed with a very worm and friendly smile and seated in the in the comfort �� of this great comfortable seats, the service was exceptionally great , my Clint loved this very beefy burger and was impressed by the hospitality and unique presentations of every dish served. i will be back for more soon"
"When I want steak, this is where I go. SO good! Great sangria also..."
"Not the best, but better than 99.9999999999% of pizzas you will ever eat."
"Exactly what the yelp rating says.. ��Meh, ive experienced better. . ��The Michelin Rating takes a knock in credibility for this one."
"Um, YUM! ?Since I'm Korean people always ask me where to go for really good Korean food and I never really have an answer for them since I make Korean food at home and my mom's food is excellent! ?But now I can recommend Crisp if you want a fast food Korean place. ?I had the Crisp BBQ wings and the bi-bim-bop with the bulgolgi. ?The sauce was good and I did not know that they give you the whole wing when you order chicken wings! ?The bi-bim-bop was good and actually a lot better than some of the other Korean restaurants that I've been to. ?I really can't do the Americanized Korean food so I probably won't try anything else but if I need a bi-bim-bop fix or Korean style wings, Crisp is where I will be. ?Oh just so you know, the serving sizes are huge!"
"Generally speaking, the pasteries are amazing. ��The coffee's alright, but nothing special. ��And it's a little pricy. ��As a bakery, though, I'd have to say it's one of my favorites.Wireless internet makes the adjoining cafe a great place to get some work done. ��There's nothing special about the ambiance, but it's generally pretty chill without the distracting hipster madness you'd see at Filter."
Very good Pho since my Mom's is still the best! It is a great stop for lunch for those cold fall and winter days... or the morning after hangovers. Their banh xeo and cafe sua da are very good too!
"We have dined here at least 3 times already and each time I try something new and get blown away. The truffle egg toast, the ravioli are delicious. The ?cacio e pepe pasta and the rigatoni are a must, order a few things and share. ?I love the daily specials, we were there last monday and got a burger and beer for $9 . Also Im an oldie but goody, and remember sole mio very well. They have dedicated a chicken dish to that restaurant and its perfect. Best chicken ever. Last night the chef brought over a 24 hour risotto, UNBELIEVABLE DELICIOUS!!! Never had anything like this in Chicago. The room itself is really warm and friendly. Nice crowd all evening and great action/people watching.Every one is super friendly. By the time you walk in the door, from the hostess to wait staff. I had a rough "
My girlfriend and I have been eating at Simply It for just over a year and decided today that we had to put the word out on how great this place has been!The service is great. Everyone is very helpful and extremely polite. The food is definetly the best Vietnamese food you can find in the Lincoln Park area. Anything you order from the menu will be great. Friends have given us the same reviews when they have gone there. On any given night this is the place to eat at instead of getting delivery.
"I'd like to start with the fact that I come here once in a while for a nice meal. I have to say I love the atmosphere more than anything, the service too. The food is very good but it isn't great and the menu is a bit short for my liking. Anyways, always a pleasure to dine there."
"some of the best deep dish in chicago; however, I only give 4 stars because I prefer more sauce and less breading. The toppings are awesome though. especially the sausage. and... have some of the best outer crust ive ever had"
"A couple of former colleagues took me out for my birthday and when I read the reviews I was full of anticipation - especially since I have never eaten in a Chinatown restaurant before after spending all my life in this city.Anyway, I am the world's biggest Orange Chicken fan - from the McDonald's of Chinese Food (Panda Express) to the hole in the wall places (New Big Wong in Washington DC). ��So without even reading the monstrous menu I order Orange chicken, spicy. ��One of my friends orders General's Chicken.Then we wait. ��And wait. ��And wait.OK here comes my chicken. ��But the other two meals are still not here.We wait. ��We wait. ��No waitress to be had.Then comes the rest of the order.Here is the Debbie Downer. ��The orange chicken and the general's chicken was THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD !. ��"
"Ok, so after passing Hot Doug's and seeing a line down the block so many times I finally found a day where very few people were in... my opening at last! ?lol ? I've visited many hot dog joints since moving to Chicago that I feel I have some expertise. ?The menu of variously prepared sausages was entertaining and alluring. ?I ended up ordering two gourmet dogs (Foi Gras and Alligator). ?Although they were tasty I expected better buns. ?Am i wrong but their buns were straight out of Jewel's. ?I think the gourmet dogs at Chicago's Dog House are just as good (maybe better). ?All-in-all, Hot Doug's is a must do if you love hot dogs."
Love the Red Velvet Pancakes! ��Service was great too. ��Looking forward to coming again!
"I can quite honestly say that this was the best restaurant experience of my life. I took my boyfriend here for his 26th birthday and the wait staff was amazing. I easily made a reservation on the restaurant's website and as soon as we walked in they knew us by name. I mentioned that it was my boyfriend's birthday and everyone who spoke to us wished him a happy birthday. We felt so welcome! The food and drinks were amazing, too. I got their stuffed chicken breast which was literally the best chicken I have ever eaten. The chicken was supremely moist and the cheese it was stuffed with was heavenly. My boyfriend got some steak (I'm not much of a steak eater, sorry, don't remember what kind/cut...) and he raved about it. We shared mashed potatoes and asparagus and they were excellent. Plus, th"
"This place is a wee bit overrated. ��I think Yuppies like it because it makes them feel adventerous to eat slightly spicy food. ��Anyway they have odd hours so call ahead to make sure they will be open when you wanna go. ��They tend to leave the door unlocked when they are closed for their mid-day change over, and then tell you in a snooty manner that they are closed. ��One of the waitresses (probably from Michigan) even had the nerve to stick her tongue out at me. ��Needless to say I am bitter and I'll NEVER set foot in that place again."
"Big Fan of Graham Elliot Bowles! ��It is a neighborhood spot for me in River North and I love having this dining spot right down the street. ��You can celebrate here for really any occasion. ��Very inventive, excellent pairings and great service!"
We have been here many times. Not as pricey as some other fondue places. The atmosphere is very romantic and making your food is a lot of fun. The only complaint I have is we had a reservation and still had to wait about a hour and a half. We ended up taking a taxi and going to sears buliding( still call it sears) and then going back. Although that was fun to do I hated the fact we still had to wait that long for our table. This actually would not stop me from going back. I love the place.
"Went last week to see what all the fuss was about and was I disappointed. It wasn't ��terrible but for those prices it should be the best in Chicago. The menu was probably the biggest let down as it looked like something from the 50s. Steakhouse have changed over the years but I guess Mastro's didn't get the message. The food was ok but soooo boring, nothing exciting to order. �� The Martinis were also crazy expensive($19). The lounge was hopping and kind of fun if you are over 60. I guess there is market for that but I would rather go to a real Chicago Steakhouse like Gibsons if that's what I'm looking for."
"Went back again for dinner...it was great! I got the chorizo torta, roast pork torta, shortrib soup, Aztec hot chocolate, churros, and Jamaica agua fresca. It was all very good. The sandwiches were excellent, very orgasmic in flavor and texture. Soup was ok, but it was huge, so either get one or the other, its a meal in its own right. Churros were warm and went great with the Aztec; though the Aztec wasnt as spicy as I was expecting, only a very light hint of heat. Anyways, definitely heading back asap!! I thought of another commenters quote of everything Bayless touches turning to gold, very true here. Muy bien Rick!"
"This place is delicious! The line is a bit long to have to wait in, but it is well worth it! Check it out...."
"We had a great dinner. ��The food was outstanding. We could not believe it when we saw a $7.00 Corkage fee on a $30.00 bottle of wine. ��I can understand corkage when you bring your own wine, but not when you order it from the menu. I have eaten in restaurants around the world and the USA. ��This is the first time this has ever happened to me.!!"
"A few doors south of Nordstroms is a restaurant with such colorful and tasty choices that they take no reservations! I arrive at 11;30am when they opened,there was already a line. My BFF and I shared several plates. The whipped feta with cucumbers and roasted cornwith heirloom tomatoes and arugula pesto disappeared quickly. The charred cauliflower was my BFF's pick. I don't eat cauliflower but was intrigued by the different colors in ��the small bowl. It was delicious! Although we were sharing, my BFF did not share her Wagyu sirloin tips with a bone marrow vinaigrette! I must try that next time. The octupus was tender and so flavorful! I have a sweet tooth, so dessert is always a must. The bread pudding was the perfect end to a lunch that ended much too quickly. I will find any excuse to re"
Great Place with great food.
My favourite steak house in Chicago downtown!!!Great food..great service...you will love the flavour of the steak ...and the fact they are serving it on the hot plate.Will be back there soon again.
I have been going here for over 45 years and now I live in the neighborhood. ��I love the food and friendly staff. ��I can even order for take out.
"if u love lively beautiful social european cafes whether you're out on a friday night or just wanting to sit with a friend and enjoy delicious appetizers and coffee, GO TO ARTOPOLIS.it's very nice and makes me feel like im in greece. I always get ice frappe and nescafe. going out on a weekend is nice, the windows are open and you hear the lively music for 9muses from across the street. everything about this cafe is amazing. the view, the people, the food, the coffee, and the interior, HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
While the food is great the service is really slow. I've been there for lunch two times and the first time it was just slow and the second time it was both slow and they messed up our orders. I don't think I'll come back again.
Absolutely the most unique flavors and presentations we have ever had. The wine (get the upgraded wine) was excellent and presented very well with a concise explanation of the wine's provenance. The waiter was a great person with an intimate knowledge of each of the courses. And there was plenty of food. We did not leave disappointed or hungry.
This place is a great place to hang out with friends and watch a game. I won't take a date here necessarily because the noise level is pretty high. The service is great! ��I tried the burgers and they were FANTASTIC. The ambiance was pretty crazy but it really depends on what time you go.I would go back with my buddies for some brews!
"Stay away from this place!Me and my girlfriend went to Zed and were quite excited about it! What a mistake that was. First, we get greeted by a pushy host (didn't get his name, but tall, glasses, african american) and wouldn't let us get a drink before our reservation. He ""preferred that we sat at our reservation time"". It was all down hill from there..Our server, Sean, did the bare minimum of what a server should do. He took about 5 minutes to actually come to our table to explain the whole process. We waned to try some of the cocktails we've been hearing about but he kept on trying to shove the wine list down our throats. We started the harvest table (best part of the night) and then the chefs came around. Most of the meat was undercooked or under/over seasoned. You can goto Gibsons and "
"http://en.wikipedia.org/��_Coming from NYC, I have been fortunate enough to experience a large variety of Bi Bim Bop. ��Not all fare is to everyone's liking which makes Crisp such an awesome spot to eat at. Their menu offers an offbeat approach to not only Korean food but also a hint of good old American eats. My favorite KFC(Korean fried chicken) is the Seoul Sassy glazed whole bird. ��My wife and I always get a buddha bowl to accompany the yummy chicken. The mild flavors of the cold marinated vegatables mixes perfectly with the steamy hot rice. Make sure you mix in the buddha sauce before you dig in(makes it ohh soo scrumptious). ��Non-KFC eaters should try out the Seoul Sensation burrito which has the Bulgogi beef and Allison's Atomic sauce on the side. ��The sweet beef with the fresh veggies"
"At a fundraiser this Feb, I won a gift certificate for 'brunch for 4' at Big Jones, and after months of planning, we finally went today. ��I felt like a queen the whole time. ��The waiter and bartender took really good care of us, and as the gift certificate stipulated, we got a three course chef's brunch. ��The goat cheese and balck pepper biscuit was very tasty, the eggs benedict with popovers was great, and the dessert was amazing. ��The chef sent out one of each of four desserts, and we coulnd't decide which was our favorite, the bread pudding or the red velvet cake.My girlfriends kept thanking me for inviting them to this wonderful experience, esp each time the waiter brought us another drink. ��The Autumn 76 was great, and the Rose Mimosa was very tasty. ��Overall, it was a wonderful brunc"
Their servings are very filling. Their flank steak and antipasto are very good. The atmosphere is a very comfortable setting. I've even enjoyed their nice wine list. Very nice local establishment overall.
"The girlfriend and I had a massive crepe craving so we came here on a Sunday afternoon. The place was mildly busy but we didn't have to wait for a table which was nice. The menus offer a great variety of crepes. She went with a Nutella/Strawberry Crepe while I had a Pineapple/Walnut/Honey crepe with added Pecans. One was light and one was more dessert-like. We both had hot beverages and I must say, the size portions of the drinks was outstanding, especially for the price. I only give this place 4 out of 5 stars because the crepe themselves are just not all that filling, for their $9+ pricepoint. It's a great place and the crepes themselves were delicious but my belly was left craving more afterwards."
"This is my favorite place to eat in all of the city of Chicago - Doug is so friendly, the variety of food is great, I always get the duck fat fries if they are available that day, and I leave stuffed for the next two days.If only they were open for dinner! Pleeease?"
"We celebrated our wedding anniversary with dinner at Sunda and had a wonderful experience. The service and food were exceptional. Sunda has a lot of energy, which only served to heighten our positive experience. Our server was talented in his service, and engaging on a personal level--he made our evening special. We were encouraged by our server to try some items on the menu that were unfamiliar to us, based on his personal experience and recommendation, and we we enjoyed each new item. The server took the time to ask/get to know our preferences, and made recommendations based on our preferences, together with his personal experience. In looking around the restaurant, it was clear to us that the customers were all enjoying themselves and also that Sunda had made sure that they hired the be"
Great service and cocktails. The casual atmosphere is comfortable yet very professional. ��Couldn't wait to try it and I wasn't disappointed. ��They know how to put their flavors together and their wine recommendations were spot on.
"I love this restaurant, the kebab, the kalamata olives, hummos, baba ganouj, persian tea all declicious reasons to overindulge."
this falafel is only in competition with a shop in paris. but i love sultan's. it beats pita inn in skokie and it just has the most satisfying falafel around.
"This place was referred to me by a friend in the city. ��She told me they have the best hot dogs and a cool drive in setting so I decided to check it out. ��I think the food was great, but these prices!?!?! ��A hot dog and fries was almost $5. ��$5! ��I admit, they use real cool packaging and the dog was very tasty, but the price was a bit much. ��It seems like you can't get a decent meal there for less than $8. ��It's a hot dog place..."
"I ate dinner with my friends at Giordano's pizza,and it was amazing. It was outstanding customer service and delicious food. Everyone should try to have a meal or drink at this restaurant one day!"
"This place is tops.They channel the spirit of true Italian cuisine (using fresh, local ingredients when available) and execute it wonderfully.This has to be our favorite, everyday Italian in the city. Uneducated Yelpers beware. This is Italian, not American-Italian. Which is a breath of fresh air for those of us who actually crave authenticity.Bravo, Anteprima, bravo."
"It seems that many reviewers sharpen their butter knives ripping into Grand Lux's eight-page menu, the occasional wait for a table, and absurd and playful d��cor. The fact remains: if you can get over the fact that Grand Lux is owned/operated by the mustache-twisting Cheese Cake Factory, you can have a really good time, and some pretty decent food there.The whole concept of the restaurant seems like the idea of a couple of stoners who then hired the Olive Garden people to bring it to life. But stoners really know how to eat well.Where else could we have ordered Double Stuffed Potato Spring Rolls, Mini Pastrami Reuben Sliders, Pot Roast Cheese Fries and an Ahi Ceviche? I assure you we weren't high, but merely unable to decide which continent's cuisine we wanted for our entr��e. ��This is a Mic"
Fogo De Chao is a great place for large groups as well as two people. I'm a vegetarian so I LOVE their huge salad bar and my boyfriend loves their unique selection of meats. Lots of food for a really great price. They also have an extensive wine list including selections from around the world and mostly South America. Overall just a great place.
"This is the first ever review that I've written and I tend to be pretty forgiving of mistakes, but I've felt really badly about not communicating my experience to someone. We walked in Tuesday night 8/24 around 9-930 and requested a two-top by the door, which we were very rudely ignored and taken to the back room instead. We were greeted by a friendly enough server who took our drink order, then promptly came back to the table to let us know the bar was backed up and we wouldn't be getting our drinks anytime soon. 20-25minutes for our first round of drinks. Just staring at the wall waiting. We tried to order a few appetizers to test the water and see if we would want more but were told by the server that the chef doesn't like it when we take incomplete orders, so go ahead and take some mor"
"Love Glenn's Diner!! IGo for the CRAB LEGS!! The service is great ,the waitress's are sweet and the coffee is strong.Get there early and expect to wait as it is always packed!!"
"Went there for lunch with a group of coworkers. The food is absolutely delicious, tasty, and unique! For dessert we got the 2 flans, and I was a bit skeptical about the mojito flan but it was probably one of the most refreshing desserts I've ever had!The only reason it wasn't 5 stars was because the service was exceptionally slow... if the food wasn't so delicious we would have been very irate. I don't know if this is just a lunch problem. But it is still worth going to!"
The Black Truffles made me feel as if I was dining in France. For some reason I never had them here before. The staff as always was impeccable. The ambiance was perfect. We have been gone to Alinea's for years. Alinea's is a nice pairing with the theater which is right by there. A great dinner and a show. Life is good
"Enjoyed bellying up to the bar, ordering a Kirin, ordered some sashimi and loved the food. ��Lived right around the corner and this was my first time there. ��Check it out - its connected to the famous Korean BBQ place."
"Not too shab for cheap mexican food in the neighborhood.The service - fast and abundant.The food - mostly delicious, although some items (tamales) taste as though they've been sitting under a heat lamp all day.Overal - I do not believe they are as AMAZING as everyone rants and raves, but they are decent. ��Love their free small appetizer with the meal.Good dishes - mole!"
"I had dinner at Kinzie Chop House the other night and, wow, what a great time! ��We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and the hostess greeted us with a smile and suggested that we start out in the bar area because there was a little bit of a wait. ��I could tell this was a popular place. ��We had a great time in the bar and Dan, the bartender, entertained us. ��They came to seat us at our table and carried our drinks into the dining room. ��The steaks, the wine, the chocolate cake, everything was fabulous. ��And service was superb. ��We will definitely be back!"
Taste and freshness was average. ��Prices too high for what you get. ��Service was average.
"LOVE LOVE LOve this place. ��if you want some amazing sushi, this is the place to go. ��If you are going for a really laid back dinner, i don't know if this is the place. ��They play fun upbeat music, fairly loud, but the food is to die for.. ��They deliver, which i also love! they always tell me an hour, but it's there in 10! ��i would strongly suggest the godzilla roll and the vegetable gyoza! ��my boyfriend finally let us get the vegetable one, and now he is hooked too, we get it everytime we go, which is at least once a week.... ��can't go wrong here, and it's byob! ��but if you forget your wine, no fear, they have it."
"Sure it is pricey but your downtown and you don't eat here every week. I have been to most of all the Brazilian steakhouses in the area and even out of state and I have to say that there is no salad bar as great as this one. I am not a big meat eater and having a salad bar that is more then just salad makes the meal. ��And OH THE PINEAPPLE!Attire is either casual or dressy, you are in the city - dress up!"
"Have been meaning to go to Irazu forever and kept on putting it off. The food igoth my. We had chifrijtos and pipitos with avocado, both were good. The only downfall was that the steak on our sandwiches was considerably over cooked. The wait for the food was beyond long and the service left us feeling ignored. My rating is an overall review but, the oatmeal banana milkshake is 5-star all the way."
"Piccolo Sogno - Little DreamWe attended the soft opening a Friday evening and absolutely loved it. ?When we arrived we were escorted to our table on a beautiful patio surrounded by lush vegetation. ?The garden is wonderful -- it's hard to believe you are still in the city. ?The decor is also very tasteful.There were four of us, and we had 2 appetizers; the burrata with prosciutto, and the zucchini blossoms with tomato sauce. ?Both were very good, but the zucchini was incredible. ?Even the tomato sauce had a distinct flavor! ?We each had an entree (pastas can be served as appetizers as well). ?I had the gnocchi made from spinach and ricotta, served with mushrooms. ?I've never been a fan of mushrooms, but these mushrooms were delectable! ?My mom had the duck, which was quite good. ?My aunt h"
"I went to Piece on a Sunday night for a 7pm reservation with the Windy City Pizza Club. Originally, we had a group of 22 booked to come; however because of the weather conditions, we had 12. I spoke with a manager a few weeks prior to the reservation and I said that we would like to be at a connected table to make it easier to talk, but the day of they moved us to The Pit.The Pit is down some stairs at Piece, where there are a bunch of small circle tables and booth style couches. It wasn't exactly what we needed but we made it work by taking several of the small tables and putting them right up against each other to make a long table, still not convenient, but fun nonetheless. I had fun where we sat as there was a big screen TV and pinball machine, and of course it was more private, but it"
"The food is amazing, and the atmosphere is warm and cosy- even though it's a large restaurant! Everything I've had there is absolutely delicious and their Saturday and Sunday brunch is amazing. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the service is a bit slow. We had to wait over 15 minutes for an omelette which I thought was a bit long, especially since our server never came back to check on us to see if we needed more drinks, etc. ��It took just as long to get our bill after our meal. If you aren't in a hurry then I would highly recommend Wilde."
"I came into Chicago from Minneapolis to visit family and have a break, which also included having my first deep dish. ��I have to say, I don't think I could have it all the time, but I'm glad to have experienced it.Giordano's was nicely low-key on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch. ��The staff were very friendly and it was fun tourist-watching (a very cute japanese couple took turns taking each other's pictures with their pizza). ��The loop location was very convenient for site-seeing and didn't seem like it was solely for tourists. ��My boyfriend and I ordered two personal size pizzas since I'm rather plain in my tastes (I had just cheese, he had meats and veggies). ��It took about 30 min, but we ate great garlic cheese bread to take the edge off. ��The pizza was hot, cheesy, and very good. ��"
"The Bongo Room rocked my socks off! The wait for a table (and the food once we ordered) was minimal, the atmosphere was laid back, the service was OUTSTANDING, and the price was warranted. My waitress was awesome! I couldn't decide between two of the pancakes, and since you get a total of 2 pancakes as your entree', she offered to bring me one of each without me asking. *Brownie points!!* So I got to enjoy the orange ricotta pancakes AND the lemon berry pancakes for the price of one...I had died and gone to heaven. They were both equally delicious, creative, and overly generous on the portion. As the Terminator says, I'll be back!!!"
This is by far the BEST tapas in Chicago. ��Jose is true to his iron chef title and had produced a gem in the South Loop. ��I visit this restaurant often and each time it is a pleasure to eat here.
"My experience at La Villa was awful. My family and ��I went to celebrate Fathers Day, and what I got was a very embarrassing experience. ��I felt ��humiliated to have my children witness such discrimination. The awful experience went ��like this. I arrived at la villas to enjoy ��what was supposed to be a good EXPERIENCE. well it went sour instantly. ��My family, Self, husband, 4 children=6, walked in and the hostess asked, how many? we replied six.... she says it would take a minute, pretty understandable. Shortly 2 min. later, ��another family walks in. The hostess asks them as well, how many people and as chance would play out, they also had a party of 6. Her reply is not to wait as we were instructed to do, but to, ""come this way"". My husband voiced to the hostess that we were there before th"
"I love burritos and Nachos, I could seriously eat them everyday. Garcia's is good for Lincoln Square, and since its close to my house, its easily accessible. If your in the area and are craving for a cheap burrito, go here. The Margaritas are pretty tasty too."
"Great tapas, friendly cute bartenders, and a happy atmosphere. What else can a guy in Chicago on business ask for?"
"I used to like this place, but I recently visited as part of a mixed couple and was made to feel very uncomfortable by my fellow patrons. ��The place is cramped and expensive, wound up paying almost $40 for a party of 5. ��I would suggest any Byron's location over this joint."
One word.Wow.
"VERY VERY OVERRATED. The dogs were decent, The fries were alright, a little soggy. The price is waaaay too much for what your getting. ��Really I can go anywhere else in the city get a better hot dog and fries for under $2.50. I understand that its a chicago icon, but that doesn't mean you should be able to rip your customers off."
I love the food but agree with others the service is terrible.......I was with my brother and we are both Asians... and the waitress would not acknowledge Me ��when i would order... and would only look at my brother.....and ask him what he wanted......!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That's my most favorite one. Visit it every time I am in town.I like everything about Le Colonial. Highly recommend !!!!!!
this place is magical. a real treat in the windy city.
Great pie! ��Met the owner he's a cool Kat. ��Def rec this place in Lincoln park for sure.
"Food is top notch and the service is great. ��What more can you ask for? ��We sat outside this past Saturday and had a bunch of rolls, devil's pot, and sticky buns with spicy shrimp. ��My wife and I were very pleased."
"I loved it!!It was a great surprise to have your food come out without even truly knowing how it was going to be prepared. ��Try the octopus appetizer- I thought it was going to be a hot (warm) dish but it's not, it's served cold and delicious. ��I was there with 3 friends and luckily we all ordered something different for appetizers, entrees and dessert. ��Everyone loved their own choices, though we all tried a bit each others. The lamb , which was cooked in duck fat was my favorite dish of the night. ��We were, also, lucky to try the rabbit ravioli, which was served for the first time on Thursday evening, the night we were there.The room is simple and yet attractive.The organic cocktails were plentiful and the apple-cider cocktail was yummy.Kudos to the chef and the staff for making our even"
"Totally enjoyed my time there. ��Starting with valet parking especially when its raining out. Ambiance was just right. Recommend a reservation. If your on a date night ask for a more private sitting arrangement. Main dining area is pretty open. Recommend the Churasco or Skirt steak add mixto and yuca or platains. ��A glass of sangria never hurts but would totally have their Raspberry Mojito or frozen margaritas again. Overall, service was fast and friendly. ��Sat in their lounge area and bar staff was pleasant. ��Get ready to spend some $$$"
"delicious, but stressful. It's noisy and there's so much going on in there- which is really fun if your in a hyper, party group of people, but there is seroiusly action everywhere and people around you bringing you things. Maybe not the best for an intimate meal, but did I say... soooooo delicious. Very fine meat. I had mine medium rare, velvety texture and such good flavor."
"We were party of 3 celebrating special occasion. We loved their competition Brazzaz and Texas de Brazil so we wanted to give Fogo de Chao a chance! Our server ruined my perfect opinion of this place! Since this is Brazilian stake house we agreed on getting Brazilian wine with our dinner. Our server was really pushing carpininas first, so we ordered them but still didn't change our mind about wine. My friends went to get salads for us when our server approached me and asked about wine. I said we would like Brazilian wine. He answered... No, no, no... you really don't want that wine, it is not good, take something else instead... I was so confused... and shocked... didn't know what to say... so he recommended wine from Chile and I said... OK... My friends returned to our table and when I tol"
"While visiting Chicago recently, my wife and I stopped in to have a quick lunch at the Cafe because both the store and the cafe looked promising. ��Unfortunately, the service was incredibly slow, ruining the whole experience. ��I had to go up to the counter to inquire, and in effect prod, the staff into serving us. ��My veggie burger was pretty good, but the staff screwed up my wife's order. ��We noted that at least two other diners in a not-particularly crowded or busy dining room (it was mid-afternoon, well after the lunch rush) also had to complain to get service. ��Based on this experience, I must recommend people avoid the F&O cafe."
"Spacca Napoli continues to be one of our favorite Chicago restaurants--wellworth the drive into the city and then some for one of their authenticNeapolitan style pizzas. ��Family night or date night, Spacca Napoli does notdisappoint. ��I just recently met the owner, Jonathan. ��What a delight! ��Heis as generous with his time and knowledge as he is with the freshingredients in his foods. ��This is a man who is doing what he loves andspreading the goodness to our hearts and stomachs. ��BTW, the staff is topnotch too. ��Go and order any pizza with the buffalo mozzarella, enjoy aglass of wine and don't be afraid to introduce yourself--you'll be glad youdid."
Total Rip-off. ��Spent $70 w/tip on brunch (no booze) for two adults and two kids. ��Must have been a problem in the kitchen because tables that were seated 30 minutes after us were served before us. ��Half of our food was cold. My skillet was literally eight bites of food for $12 dollars. ��Less than a1/4 cup of potatoes and chorizo under two eggs. ��A tiny omelet with a pancake and a soggy bit of lettuce salad on the side was $15 dollars (my eleven year old was still hungry after eating it..and she is a small girl). ��The waitress asked if we wanted a pancake instead of toast for a couple of bucks more. Since when is a couple of bucks 3 dollars? ��Couple means 2 where I'm from. ��Got the heel of a piece of banana bread for 4 bucks.Got to the car and saw that a server had spilled maple syrup all 
"Based on hundreds of reviews I had to check this place out, WOW WOW WOOOOO!!Not sure where that came from sorry. ��I'm sure it's written in stone somewhere that Thou shall never go to a ""great spot"" without a reservation or hopes of ever getting seated. ��Well our prayers were answered when my party of 4 showed up. Friendly service, great food and not to mention the ladies ��seating at the very end were making my 90 miles experience that more memorable. Thanks for great food and living up to all the expectations I walked in with.Keep up the great work.Oh street parking was a bit of a hiccup and took longer than expected but it gave us a reason to walk further since we ate so much."
"When we visit Chicago, love to get the house salad and pasta. ��My husband and I share this with the house bread and is enough to satisfy our appetites at a reasonable price. ��Good atmosphere. ��We enjoy sitting in the booths...Nice environment--lots of people, but good acoustics and friend people. ��Would recommend it, but be prepared for long waits during weekends and main dining hours."
I love to eat vanilla ice cream with smashed up pretzels marinating in the softening ice cream. The longer those salty pretzels linger the better the blend of sweet meets salt. The white chocolate and caramel pretzel pancakes always satisfies this craving. The presentation of white chocolate drizzled across the pancake creates excitement for the eyes awaiting that first bite. The taste was divine. Perfection of blend of textures awakening my taste buds. It was such a pleasure to dine at the Bongo Room. We were a party of 4. Each of us ordered a different selection and each of us was again quite pleased with our dining experience.
Good food and service.Beautiful decor.A nice date spot.
"Not worth the hype. Its a nice romantic, dimly lit date spot. ��They make you wait and wait because they dont believe in standing. ��The drinks are strong but Im not too keen on the concept of drinking anything with raw eggs in it. They make alot of drinks with a raw egg meringue on top. ��I dont like how they wont allow anyone to stand around. As a former bartender I can see why its a place thats big with bartenders becasuse the drinks are strong and well made BUT you could get drinks as good elsewhere. And the high backed seats are uncomfortable and lack intimacy and discourage socialization with others."
"We went to this restaurant last october on my birthday. The ambience, music & people were lively & rocking. Though we are vegetarian, we had lotta options her.We started off with the 3 cheese platter, Mixto which was deliciously satiating & feast for the gastric senses & a visual treat for the eyes. we then had the patatas bravas which were spicy potato with spicy paprika Aioli. You can keep on eating them without a pause. we ordered one more plate towards the end. we then ordered the Arroz con morels, bomba rice with aspharagus, lemon & morel mushrooms. The restaurant is a bit expensive considering the small plates, but as they say, good things come in small packages !!! Lovely food, Lovely music, Lovely experience & a perfect place to celebrate the perfect day !!!!"
"I used to love this place, till one day they decided to raise there prices like crazy!!I used to be there every weekend, have a nice reasonably priced lunch, and I used to take all my friends there, now I'm telling everyone to stay away cause they raised there prices like crazy!! Shame on you CALO"
"Horribly overpriced food with excellent service. For two people with one cheap drink each, the bill was $129.95. For that money, you get (with the seafood platter, not the most expensive item on the menu, and no a la carte):1. Three pieces of lettuce with two slices of cucumber as a salad (one salad per person)2. Cheese fondue with 4 small slices of apple, two small slices of pear, 6 grapes, and 4 cubes of bread.3. Fondue dinner with 6 scallops total, 6 shrimp, two small wads of supposedly shaved lobster, 5 mushrooms, some sliced onion, sliced green pepper, two potato cubes, and 8 dipping sauces.4. Chocolate fondue with 6 triangles of pineapple, 6 cubes of apple, 4 cubes of pound cake, and 6 quarter-sized pieces of banana. That's all you get for $129.95. Not even half an apple for two peop"
"This place was awesome. ��We were up that way to go to Kuma's but it was packed so we ended up here. ��I had been meaning to go to one of these places because my mother is Romanian. ��The food was great, and the attentiveness of the owner was remarkable. ��He was over the top enthusiastic and as other reviewers wrote, his personality alone made it fun in there. ��I didn't tell him I was part Romanian because I thought his head might explode.The service was a bit slow as others pointed out, but they claimed they were down a waitress for the night so I'm not deducting for that. ��They had 2 waitresses for ~7 tables, one of them a party of 20. ��So I felt it was reasonable.Again, the food was great although probably not like what most people are used to. ��We had the Sausage Stuffed Chicken, Veal Pap"
".sloppy joes - awesome flavor, little bit of kick.. delicious.housemade pork sausage - ��great texture, not oily at all, seasoned well, more akin to a big, supertasty kebab .burger - classic, default is with bacon (score).bourbon - good selection w. 1 or 2 oz pours...great service - was thanked no less than 3 times on teh way out the door not to mention a yelp email from the owner for taking the time to review.. overall, great, hearty gastropub fare at a good price.. bourbon selection seals the deal, ill be back for sure.."
"If I could give negitive stars I would give this place -5 stars. Ok so Americans tend to prefer heavy, greasy food. That is what you get here. Im fairly sure that is that is why this place gets good reviews from other people, it fits with with the overall American taste for huge servings of high carb, high saturated fat, blobs of grease. This place is not an accurate representation of middle eastern food AT ALL. On another note the place was dark and not aestetically appealing.In conclusion, if you are into Mcdonalds type immitations of ethnic cuisine, similar to the Chinese greasey spoons, this is your spot. I personally think the food was absoluty terrible, I sampled and ordered several different dishes and was unsatisfied with every on of them.Terrible!"
Must say that I went again recently... service was MUCH better. Last time I apparently was oblivious to the fact that they have a rooftop... and AMAZING rooftop... ��Meat is so so... (Fogo still rocks.... I would say that even Texas is a few steps further) but the dessert! OHHHHH the dessert! Butterscotch bread (or something near that) HEAVEN! And the white Sangria is very good as well although not that strong. Overall definitelly worth a trip... just to the rooftop maybe for drinks and desserts!
"It was fantastic! ��I loved the bacon-wrapped dates, stuffed with almonds and the croquettes. ��The olives were only ok. ��I wish I would have ordered the cheese plate (Queso - Mixto)... the folks next to us did and it looked excellent. ��The service was OK, but not great, but all-in-all, it was an excellent meal! ��I would definitely return!"
"Frontera and Topolobambo are definetely the best mexican restaurants in the city. ��hands down. ��it's pricey, but definetely worth the cash and wait (min month in advance for reservation)."
"Crunchy, flavorful, messy sandwiches... craving another already. ��Happy with the guac and chips, but in love with the churros!"
Worth the wait. Long line though!
go some place else to eat you tourists....
"Good dogs. ��A little pricey, but I think you pay for the experience. ��This place is cash only, so dont bring your card. ��There is an ATM located there also."
"Tastes delicious, but the price is expensiveMaybe going again"
"My most favorite. ��Delicious, fresh, economical, fun, great atmosphere, unique flavor and spot. ��Love it!"
"Carry-out service is awful. ��Phone staff and manager can definitely do a better of retaining customers or being respectful to first-time customers. ��Understand this place has old business or regulars but that doesn't mean they should not put effort into treating first-time carry-out customers well. ��Dine-in is okay, menu has a good variety of items and some waitstaff clearly shine but, again, only if you're a repeat customer. ��WIth so many pizza and fine dining options in the neighborhood, would recommend findining another one and avoiding Calo unless it's for one-time dining."
"The owner is terribly rude, and getting a table with more than 2 people is basically impossible. ��The cashier literally screamed at me when I tried to order before I was seated. ��She refused to take my order, put down her pen, and walked away. ��(The other cashier, a very nice guy, did take our order).I called the next day to talk to the manager about the rude cashier, and it turned out that the cashier was the manager/owner. ��I am FLOORED that the owner of a business would behave that way. ��Besides being wildly unprofessional, it was just unnecessary. �� The way the restaurant is set up is kind of confusing--you have to wait for the hostess to seat you, but then go stand in line at the ��counter for your food, which is brought to you by a waiter. ��I can't imagine this is the first time that "
Amazing food and good service. ��I def recommend.
"We live down the street from the Bad Apple, and my husband and I were regulars until we had our son 4 months ago. We liked the menu (good veggie options) and beer selection. We haven't gone out to eat much in the last 4 months, but yesterday we decided to bring him in for the first time. My aunt and uncle were in town, and my parents came with us too, so we had 6 adults and a baby with a foldable stroller with a removable carseat. The large round table in the main area was available, but the host told us that there wasn't room for a stroller near that table, so he seated us in the back room with another large (loud) party with two newborn crying babies. The room was so dark that we couldn't see each other or our food even though it was the middle of the day, and our baby seemed frightened."
"The only complaint I can ever give about The Chicago Diner is that they took the wheatloaf sandwich off of the menu! It was my go-to for a looong time. I have never left this place unhappy or hungry. I always loved that I could come here for some good ol' comfort food. Vegan mashed potatoes and gravy? Sign me up. If you can tear yourself away from your entree' and save room for dessert, you have to try the chocolate cake. It's so good they sell them at Whole Foods all over the suburbs. I get them when I can for my birthday.Service has always been super friendly. (Even when my 8-year old daughter and I go alone. In other places we have been made to feel like crap and left unattended for long periods of time.)I can't wait to go again!!"
"I would NEVER eat here again. My friend and I went for lunch one afternoon, and witnessed the most disgusting sight I have ever seen! As we were waiting on our food to arrive, I went to use the restroom, as I passed by where they serve the food, the bus boy was smashing a cockroach with the bottom of the bottle of disinfectant used to clean the tables!!!! Gross. We waited for our food ( we probably should have left) and when it arrived it was average. The crepe was overcooked and tough. The waitress was less than attentive, but i am not surprised considering the owner was shouting at her for answering the phone.. he was so rude to her, and we could tell the girl was visibly upset, not that it phased him!!Also, it was a very hot afternoon, so we asked the waitress if it would be possible to"
Only complaint is wait which if there is no line for place...makes you kind of wonder. ��Sushi great and fresh which I think is the most important for that kind of food. The interior is fabulous and just makes it feel like you're going 'out'...you know? Just add the extra time in your night.
"I'm not sure I even need to review this place since it has so many glowing reviews, but hot damn...the food is an epiphany. Seriously, if you're into gustatory hedonism, this place is heaven. This is the kind of restuarant that has helped establish Chicago as one of the most important culinary cities in the world. And I mean WORLD!"
"I really wanted to like this place based on what I've read, but it just didn't live up to the hype. ��The food was decent, the service horrendous. ��If you are looking for a better option, Ukrainian Village is full of them. ��I personally would settle for a small Lou Malnati's deep dish over this place any day, however, as I've stated in some of my other reviews, I really do recommend Picante, Smoke Daddy or even Janiks over on Damen/Division. �� There's also a nice couple of Italian restaurants in the area as well. ��Overall, this place is worth checking out as we may have just gone on a bad day and ordered the wrong thing, but we just waited so long that if I had a choice between picking up a burrito and eating right away while watching football or sitting down and waiting for an hour and hav"
"we are having a wedding party at piccolo in one week. ��WE already know the food and wine are superb, BUT Louis has out serviced himself on this one! He has been so responsive and helpful in picking menus and wine and dessert, let's see if he can order the right weather too...You go Louis!!!"
"If there is one thing I miss about America... this is it.My friend started taking me here this summer and... oh man. I don't even know where to begin with how delicious and wonderful this place is. We always get there pretty early to avoid an incredibly long line, but I'd even go there if I had to wait two hours. It's so worth it! Doug is amazing and is so friendly that your wait seems like it never happened. The specialty menu is divine, along with their everyday dog and sausage offerings! I've had so many things now I can't even remember, but I always love getting a boring ol' dog with celery salt, tomatoes, and onions. Yum!I'll go back there any time I'm home. Love it, love it. The music is always good, too!"
Great Food! Great Atmosphere! Opa!!!Must Eat!!!!!
"Great burgers! I love this place, just wish i could eat there more :( Sooood good, but if you are trying to keep the pounds off this is not the place."
"The wang galbi is either not marinated long enough or with skimped ingredients so the meat tastes bland. ��The meat itself was sliced too thin to be even called galbi. ��The sam gyup sal was bacon slice thin (which is bad). ��The veggies and tofu in the soup it comes with (dwen jang jjigae) is not cooked. ��They must have chopped it up raw and threw it in pre-made broth before serving, like miso soup. ��There were a lot of side dishes but only about 3 out of the 15 were good. ��Who cares about the service when the food was this bad. ��I'm embarrassed to call this Korean food. ��It should not taste this way."
The pizza here is really good but a little pricey. ��I tried the Margarita pizza and it was great!

Curry Fish Madness and Lychee Martini is my warmest comfort on the coldest day. Thanks Indie for the Friend of Indie club card.
No stars. This place sucks. This city is loosing its soul to yuppie places like this. A hot dog stand needs to be a hot dog stand! ��No fancy bull shit. But the people who go here can get a hot dog With KETCHUP and go home and watch Friends
"Stephen was our server and he was knowledgeable and prompt. ?We don't drink, so we couldn't put his knowledge of the wine and beer list to the test but other diners really seemed to enjoy his recommendations.For my pocketbook, this was a bit of a splurge for us. ?My husband had the escargot soup which was very rich and tasty and the veal breast. ?The veal was a rather large portion. ?I had two items from the 3rd course menu: ?new bedford scallops and carmalized lobster. ?Both of my seafood dishes were delicious.Our total tab for 3 appetizers and 1 entree, and one cocktail (kir royale $12) was about $90 before tip.Restrooms very clean. ?We sat in the quieter back dining area, the bar area was loud but not obnoxious. ?I really enjoyed the decor, handsome dark brown booths, white linen with b"
"My family has been dining at Trattoria Sapori for years and we always have a great meal. Start with the Crostini Di Avocado (chopped avocado with cheese and chopped tomato on Italian bread), a surprisingly good take on the familiar bruschetta. For the salad course, we really like the Insalata Stella with endive, provolone, pinenuts & fruit. I've had the Risotto ai Funghi and Gnocchi al Brivido in the past and loved both, but Cappellacci di Zucca (a pumpkin/squash stuffed ravioli) is my favorite dish here. We've always seen generous portions on all dishes. This is NOT traditional Italian food. I love that there are lots of vegetarian dishes (I don't eat meat), and plenty of veal, chicken, etc. for my dining companions to enjoy. The atmosphere is cozy, there is a small dining room with a cou"
"Looking for vegetarian/vegan comfort food? This is your restaurant.I've been here a good number of times, and typically I get the Reuben or the Dagwood sandwich, although I've also had the Half-Pipe and the Titanic Burger. I'm also a big fan of the buffalo wings, and the chocolate peanut butter shake is to die for (the shakes cost nearly double what you might expect a typical shake to cost, but are well worth it, especially if you can't/don't eat dairy). As for sides, I usually get the sweet potato fries, the mac and cheeze, or the kale - very different options, but each delightful. I've also been for brunch once: what I remember most was the biscuit and gravy, which was delicious.As far as I can tell, it's less busy during the week than it is on weekends (natch), and you probably wouldn't"
"It was my god son's birthday two days ago and I took him here which is his first steak house. Everything on the menu is great! If you are a steak person, this is the place to go to."
Does anything else need to be written about this place? ��Its the shit. ��And Doug always has awesome glasses on. ��When you show up and their is a line WAIT. ��The line is worth it all 3 hr's of that line are worth it.
"give them a day to work out the kinks at the new local and then you won't get any better then this. friendly people operating a great lunch/ dinner spot (have yet to try breakfast, but coffee is tasty). the open air, back patio is alive with energy and music, creating a great atmosphere to unwind and enjoy late summer evenings (byob). the Bistec sandwich ($6.50 ��cheap around these parts and definitely well worth it) is fantastic, if you want to stray from the cubano. also try the guava and cheese empanada. sooo good.bring $12. get variety of flavors. leave happy. return soon."
Excellent food! The pumpkin ravioli I have been reading about is to die for!!! Good wine list.
"I was visiting Chicago and went here base on Food & Wine Magazines ratings. ��I expected the beers to be great, which they absolutely were. ��But what surprised me is that our food was just as good as the beer. �� The grilled radicchio salad was out of this world."
"Coudn't resist. If you're pmsing....do yourself a favor and just buy something anything from this place. It will just make you feel better. Girls, you know what I'm talking about."
Yolk in Chicago...This place has sensational food and a nice view of the city park. ��Parking is easy if your driving. ��Best breakfast ever!!!! ��One of the best meals during our weekend trip.
"Great hot...errr, I mean SuperDawgs. Definitely giving Vienna hot dogs a run for their money. Gotta love the retro feel of the place, complete with car hop service right to your car window - just like the old days. Fries are excellent, too. My one complaint is the way they stuff that large hot dog plus the fries into a little box. That squishes everything and makes the hot dog - ok, SuperDawg - hard to take out of the box and eat. Grab a ton of napkins 'cause it gets messy. Still, it's worth the trip and the mess."
If your into vegetarian food...Check this place out !! I would of gave them 5 stars but I had to wait too long to be seated...lol
I actually loved this place. Stopped by on Midnight with a few friends and I ordered a taco salad . Was very filling and tasty! Service was great and the atmosphere was nice. I would definitely come back.
"First of all tne name is SAN SOO KAB SAN. We had lunch there on Dec, 12. 2011 . I wouldn't advise anyone to go there, it is filthy, everything is not cleaned , and at the last moments of the meal we were visited by a cockroach on our table. When we cried, they just came killed the cockroach with a napkin and said they were sorry. Thats it, go and enjoy .."
"I have been to Nana twice, first time Oct 2009, don't remember what I ate for breakfast, but remember I was quite pleased. ��I was just there last week June 2010 for brunch and ordered an iced latte along with the Lemon Ricotta Hemp & Fruit Pancakes, they were delicious! ��There were 5 of us gals that went for brunch, everyone was more than satisfied, and I was impressed with the outdoor seating arrangements and the live herb planters along side the tables was quite clever. ��I live in Tucson, and will definately make it to Nana everytime I am back in my old neighborhood of Bridgeport. ��I'm glad to see a classy, reasonably priced, little bistro ��there. ��Good job folks!:)"
"I've been to Caro Mio probably 10 times in the last 3-4 years, and I always leave there feeling the same way: wow, that was an expensive dinner for just okay food. Yes, I know the portions are large, but I still hate the idea of paying $20 + for so-so pasta. And $12 for (terrible!) caprese salad? That's $3 a.. a... caprese!! You're on Wilson off the Brown line, not Midtown Manhattan.If they would knock $5 or 7 off each entree and serve half the portion, they'd come out ahead, and people might not look askance at their prices.Oh, yeah, and the service here is always hit or miss - Thursday night, 8 pm, the place is 60-70% full, with a handful of 4 tops open. Where do they seat us? At a tiny 2 seat table, crammed against the wall, in what is basically a hallway. My friend and I were laughing "
"I came here with my husband about a week ago and loved almost everything... The Kobe meatballs were awesome!! ��Service was just good not great it kinda took a while for drinks, and it was just beer. ��So... I was looking forward to the marrow - it was the most disappointing dish. Just flat flavor - missing something. ��But the fried clam things - loved it!! I will absolutely go back!!"
There is not a better steak in chicago in my opinion. The lobster bisque is incredible the service is incredible. No need to go anywhere else
Delicious Italian food and very reasonable prices. ��Kind of loud which makes it difficult to talk. �� No wonder this is Jennifer Aniston's favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago!
"Second visit a couple of nights ago .... This place is outstanding in every way. Great environment, great service, great food ... They do not miss a beat. Please keep it up! You are my new #1 BBQ joint on the planet!"
"I am always in search of a good breakfast place and I have tried a few which were deemed the best, but after eating at Meli cafe and juice bar last weekend, i have a favorite new breakfast/brunch spot! This is the best! Perfect atmosphere, friendly staff, good service. Coffee was perfect, juice blends were divine,smoothies were delicious! I ordered the strawberry waffle and my husband had the Meli toast. It was light, tasty and delightful! We are craving to come back!"
"I've walked past GILT BAR and read so many great things about this place I just had to make reservations to eat here. I had some friends moving from Chicago and thought, this would be a great time and place to take them. Hmm.. BAD DECISION.. They had me down for the wrong day and weren't very helpful in getting my a table. My sister had to talk to the manager and he attempted to accommodate us. I was so turned off we just left. I've spoken to other about this place and seem to have received the same treatment. Not sure why people won't write a bad review. Well.. I guess I will start."
I have been there twice and I love it. ��The sandwiches are great. ��The owners are awesome. ��Alberto and Christine (I hope i am spelling the names right) are the best. ��They are the nicest couple and I will continue to go there just to support them and their wonderful restaurant. ��You should for sure give it a try.
"I have eaten at Gilt 4 or 5 times and never had a good experience. ��I go back because the food is good (until last night). ��I alway keep hoping that the service will be better but it never is. ��I have always enjoyed the food but last night we ordered the lemon meringue and they made the meringue with salt. ��We called out waitress over told her that it was salty not sweet and she did not believe us so she tasted it at our table. ��How do you make a mistake like that? The chef did not even come out to apologies, that is just common courtesy ��if you just made your patrons eat spoonfuls of salt. ��They will make you wait 30 mins at the bar for your table and then seat you at one that has been empty the whole time you have been waiting. �� The music is LOUD we asked the hostess to turn it down and"
"'That was good two days in row!' That's what my girlfriend said about the Ropa Vieja at Cafe 28 when I told her that I was siting here Yelping it. So was my honey jalapeno pork chop with sweet potatoes - the portions were big enough that we ended up bringing the extra home. I sure as hell wasn't leaving it behind considering how good everything tasted. I hadn't eaten here in quite a while, but my friends swear by it. Since they were in town after moving away last year they had to eat there. And since we were having dinner with them, well so were we. Which is a good thing because the mojitos kick ass. I think that it's between Cafe 28 and Nacional 27 for the best mojitos I've had in Chicago. The rest of dinner was pretty spot-on. The ceviche was fresh if not exceptional, the tamal cubano wa"
"WOOOOOOOOOOOOO ARTOPS BABY!!! THE BEST HANGOUT IN THE CITY OF CHITOWN!!!! as for all the idiotic people that said the service was slow....deal with it, we greeks take it easy. plus, they are EXTREMELY busy all the time so of course it might slip the mind to give u more water. will it kill u to ask for it? and for the guy who said he got a disease from anal to oral contact...... i suggest YOU wash ur hands after u pick ur butt and eat. dont blame it on others. has anyone even heard of that disease....ever? artopolis is amazing...if ur their for food, dessert, coffee, or just to hang out and watch a game.... ur in for a treat! (and im not saying all this cuz im greek....i only tell it like it is :))"
"I'm not a vegetarian, but this place was great. ��I had the spinach quesadillas and they were the best. ��It's to have seat on the patio if the weather is nice."
"My daughter took me here for a birthday present, and it was one of the best presents I've ever had. ��The music was fantastic. ��The wait staff was friendly and efficient. ��I, personally, like the fact that they try to keep the noise down during the performances. I want to hear the music. ��We got there early for good seats and were able to enjoy conversation before the show and in between (three) sets. ��Chilled during the music. ��Would love to go back again when I'm in Chicago."
"The green mill is a Chicago landmark for a reason. Great music almost every night, incredible ambience, good drinks and I think the staff is very friendly. The jazz music is some of the best I've seen around, and green mill can provide a fun change on a Saturday night. Can be a bit pricey but...Last time I went it was the after hours jazz party with Sabretooth."
"I LOVE SIMPLY IT.great food, great prices, and great staff. ��the owner is always there and very very friendly. ��the food is always very fresh and the portions are always very generous. ��i wish i lived and/or worked closer because i would go once a week to get my vietnamese craving satisfied.simply it is simply awesome"
"In a city full of some of the best and most plentiful food options in the world, I can safely say that Simply It is my FAVORITE Chicago eatery. ��The food is always fantastic and fresh and affordable. Also, of all the Vietnamese places in Chicago, to my tastes, it comes the closest to all the wonderful food I enjoyed during my time in Ho Chi Minh City. Very authentic and very good.Not to mention the service is always prompt and incredibly cheery. ��The owner is particularly sweet, always happy to greet you with a smile. ��Whenever anyone visits from out of town, I always make a point to bring them to Simply It. Because it's simply the best!"
"It's really wonderful to find a restaurant ��that not only has reasonably priced ��dishes, but also ��a warm friendly atmosphere. ��Any dish I have tried, and there are many to choose from, ��was served ��graciously and in a timely manner. ��The wait staff, although English ��not being their first language, tries ��to understand and ��answer any questions I ask. ��I especially enjoy the Simply It Beef dish, and all the clay pot entrees, salmon being my favorite. ��The ginger tea ��is a compliment to the meal.The owner Tuan ,usually gives fruit ��after the meal ��as his way to say ��thankyou. ��He is an extremely ��kind ��gentleman, who really cares about ��his restaurant and wants to make his customers feel that they are special. ��I usually eat ��here every couple of weeks, and have never had a bad experience."
"This is a great restaurant, my wife suggested we go here after attending a concert at the Aragon. The manager was incredibly friendly and accomodating. Nice selection of food and a variety of local and international beers (although the castel beer on the menu is advertised as South African it is NOT the famous Castle Lager and is in fact an Ethiopian brew). Highly recommended!"
"We went for brunch. ��I ordered the special, which was a sun choke scramble with a side of potatoes. ��The potatoes were undercooked, had a bizarre, artificial smoky flavor, and seemed as if they had been sitting around for a few hours before they were served. ��The sun chokes in the scramble were also way undercooked. ��For the price, the food here is ridiculously sub-par. ��None of the three other people I went with were happy with their food either, due to basic problems like flavor. ��I felt so bad for the waiter, who was really nice, but we really should have sent everything back. ��WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!"
"This place used to be hidden. Now every time i go there its packed like crazy. Luckily the food is still good and they try as hard as they can with the service. It used to be a 5 star for me but now after the renovation and with all these yuppies crowding the place, its lost something."
"I HEART BRUNCH! The diverse menu is the biggest draw at Honey- you can get anything from pancakes, to beer to vegan black bean soup. The baked goods are great. ��Prices are very reasonable. This place can get very crowded during peak weekend brunch hours and since this is a ��small space it can be hard to get a table. Another added bonus is the drink menu Mimosas, blood Marys and other common afternoon cocktails are served along with wine and beer. ��Honey is a great addition to the Wicker Park neighborhood."
"Wow, was I disappointed. ��Overpriced, mediocre pizza with soggy crust. Appetizers were greasy and salads were basically lots of iceberg lettuce. Way overrated."
"I am a GREAT fan of this place. There are many things that I enjoy here. Starting with, I really enjoy their avocado tacos and their homemade lemonade. Delicious! ��I have tried their different salsas and like to usually blend the 3 together and get a really spicy version.My kids will eat just about everything off their dessert menu and their ochata (spelling?) drink they usually slurp in a heartbeat.My husband tried the shrimp fajitas last time and loved them! He didn't save a single bite for me. I will deifniently try them next time.As for desserts, I agree with my kids, the flan is amazing!"
the produce at this location was all wilted. ��quality of the deli stuff was aweful . i bought some expensive almondine trout and lavender turkey slices. and both were terrible. i know i am not going to step into f& o ever. the quality has gone to thy kingdom come.one has to get value for the money ��one spends and that is not available at ��f& o. i guess the rent kills it. used to be a gr8 pace to shop.
"I was so excited to go here as I have heard nothing but good things about this place and been given recommendation after recommendation for it. With that said my expectations were very high. This place isn't awful, but I certainly did not feel that I would recommend this place. The food was fair (we all ordered something different so I had a variety of things) and none of it blew me away. I was disappointed by the plantains and the shakes everyone raves about is not that great. I think what we have here is another hip place to be for Wicker Park. Oh yes, the guy with the beard and the weird creeper eyes wearing a flannel button up shirt from some thrift store, dirty jeans, a filthy looking beard and looked as if he needed a serious bath was there along with his hipster girlfriend wearing h"
"Went for lunch- was fantastic! Get lunch combos. Wait staff was friendly, helpful, and fast. Would definitely recommend"
five stars
"Don't get the big hype?? Appetizers and drinks were ok, but nothing to rave about."
Amazing Food! Seriously Rick is the man when it comes to Mexican! I love that he is always at the restaurant and that he is so hands on! I grew up in Texas and my friends from home all think that I am crazy because I brag about this place being better than some of their favorites. Then when they visit and I take them they are all believers. This place truly is amazing and if you have the chance to go you are a fool if you don't take it!
busy place all the timeneed to wait all the timebut if you are in the mood for something tastyhighly recommend asian nachos
Make sure you starve yourself all day before coming here. ��Fogo has a large variety of fresh meats to choose from and a huge salad bar. ��I love the idea of small pieces of meat. ��This way you can sample all of them and still have room for dessert. Their creme brulee is very tasty!!!
"I've been going to Opart for at least six years since I'd moved near the restaurant. The interiors for a neighborhood restaurant are beautiful and authentic and I also love the femmie waiters! I know that's not PC but they are so interesting and nice! The one thing I love is the Shrimp Tom Yum soup. I always order a cup of brown rice to tone down the spice but I find the chinese food on the menu to mediocre and bland, however they do good thai! My advice is only order thai and you won't be disappointed, but veggies in boring gravy, forget about it! Curries, yes! Oh yes and it's BYOB so that's cool too!"
just ok.. there are better cuban joints to go to.. Rinconcito cuban cafe on Fullerton and saywer is much better so is marianos on milwaukee. you can also get an awesome sandwich at bella cafe near fullerton and spaulding. i just thought with all the hype that i would be amazed but it was just ok lettuce and tomato sandwich on a french bread. a lil greasy and too much vinegar i believe. i'll try another sandwich next time i'm extra hungry and near them.
"The decor and art along the back walls is nice, it sort of reminds you of a country farm but very bright and imaginative, but the food, that is another story. ��crab cakes were mushy and small portion. ��It's a big restaurant and maybe they just cant keep up with the quality of the food, because myself and 2 of the 3 diners I was with were disappointed in the food including the blackened chicken and hopping jack. ��I think I'll try Wishbone for brunch but never again for dinner."
"best wings i have ever had in my life! i always bring people here and they all agree, crisp is the best! the wings are huge and all of the sauces are so good. pretty inexpensive too."
"Crisp is fantastic but one word of warning, CASH ONLY. I can't believe how much they give you for the cost. If i had to choose a string of words to describe it I would say quasi-hipster-seoul-food. ��They have Bimmibop and fried chicken (huge btw), awesome fries, steak bowls and crazy items like korean burritos. It's great food and it's on the cheap, a great spot to swing by. The benches aren't real comfortable and food preparation takes awhile, i recommend ordering ahead"
Favorite Restaurant in Chicago!! Totally worth trying it out....it's BYOB too so it's very reasonable! ��Everyone I bring here ��for dinner LOVES it!
"Meat, Meat, and more meat....This place is why global warming is so bad...All those cows we eat!Anyways, very friendly service, good selections of meat, great wine list, poor valet service. ��I would go back in a heartbeat, but I would self park my car. ��Those guys took F O R E V E R..."
"DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY! ��That should be in their heading. ��Actually, I don't know why they offer it. ��When pizzas are consistently delivered in 90min..."
"Love the beer, especially Top Heavy and Dark and Curvy. While the pizza is one of the best in town, I do agree with some of the other reviews that the cheese is used too sparingly. I tried to get extra cheese as one of my toppings twice, but it barely tasted or looked any different. I will try to order extra extra cheese next time! :) Other than that, the place is cozy and I enjoy spending my Friday afternoons there."
"Based on food/drinks alone, I would give Sprout 3 stars. ��The three courses, plus intermezzos (shaved ice/sorbet, grilled cheese quarter with a small pour of Chardonnay) are seemingly economical for $60. ��The cocktails were not so great - julep is sickening sweet, gingerdale has much better equivalents elsewhere (e.g., Violet Hour, Longman & Eagle), with the rhubarb martini as the best of the three we tried. ��The There were three of us who shared each of the 3 courses, and some were hits (course 1 - scallop, course 2 - rabbit) and most were misses (course 1 - foie gras, course 3 - none were good, but most notably the corn). ��Again, based on food alone, Sprout is mediocre. ��There are much better places within walking distance (e.g., Kith & Kin, Sweets & Savories, etc.). ��After much contempl"
"My favorite sushi bar in Chicago. ��I keep trying to find other sushi bars that are as good but are closer to me or aren't as busy, but I can't!!Our service has always been outstanding. ��Our waiters always recommend something amazing. ��We typically order sushi rolls and make sure to always order at least one dragon roll (our favorite).We have always had to wait for table, so that's probably the biggest negative. ��But they have tables for people who are waiting and it's BYOB, so just bring an extra bottle for the wait."
"Tried Revolution Brewing Co. last Friday night and loved it! �� The beer selection was great, and our server was happy to offer ideas and suggestions. ��The bacon popcorn was great and very unique! ��In fact, the entire menu offered unique selections that were a refreshing change from the usual.Even though it was packed, we had a beer at the bar while waiting and the hostess came and found us, remembered my name, and got us a great table. �� We will definitely be back!"
"Three times I had reservations for a Friday night, three times the reservation was confirmed on Thursday and three times my reservation was cancelled last minute. ��This place might have awesoime food but it SUCKS!"
"My parents were in town over the weekend and wanted to experience a great Chicago steak. �� We read the reviews on Yelp and decided on Kinzie. ��We were not disappointed. ��The service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly and very helpful. ��The steaks were fabulous. ��My husband and I split the 18 oz delmonico (btw they don't charge a split fee). ��It was by far the juiciest, most flavorful cut of meat we had had in a very long time. ��I also felt it was a great value. ��The a la carte items are good portions that can be split. ��In my opinion, Kinzie is a much better value than the other chop houses in town!!"
It's a long line. ��The hours are short. ��But nothing was going to come between us and our duck fried french fries! ��Definitely worth the trip and the wait....Make sure that yougo on a Thursday and come early to get your fries. ��The sausages are heavenly too!
One of the best steak house in Chicago. The brazlian style of serving is awesome. I get tired of eating one kind of steak. This is where you can keep on trying different steaks. The only thing to keep in mind this place is always crowded especially for dinner.
"My wife and I are big Chicago deep-dish fans. ��Our current favorite is Gino'a East, but we typically try a new deep-dish place each time we're in Chicago. ��This time it was Giordano's. ��Overall, we were not impressed. ��Like Gino's East, Giordano's does not take any reservations. ��So the wait to get to your table is anywhere from 1 - 2 hours on a weekend night. ��We waited for 90 minutes. ��They do allow you to pre-order your pizza, which was a nice feature that allowed the pizza to be served within minutes of our seating. ��Waiting aside, what we really care about is this pizza. ��The crust of this pizza has less of a corn flavor than Gino's, which some people prefer. ��However, the sauce and overall flavor of Giordano's was disappointing. ��The sauce tasted like something out of a can. ��We orde"
Great baked goods and wonderful selections! ��We love that they are open late night and the food at the cafe is always outstanding! ��One of the best in Chicago!
"I recently moved to Streeterville and was so excited to see F&O so near me.....I wish I still had the same feeling, worst service ever. walked in to the cafe for a coffee and a side of chicken sausage to go, thinking it would take no more than 5-10 min..never will I stop there for a quick cup of joe. I was late to work, while the server stared at me and didnt even ask what I was waiting for. finally after twenty minutes did I get my coffee and sausage. Thought I would try it again (since it was only a block from my place), same thing, except this time they were flat out rude. If you dont want to be late in the morning and want to grab a quick cup of coffee F&O is NOT the place to go!"
"A total yuppie spot, which means you should expect to dine amid obnoxious drunk frat guys and snobby holier-than-thou Paris Hilton look-alikes. ��The bland yuppie-like atmosphere isn't the only bad thing about this place. ��I agree with the reviewer below about how the place was SO DARK. ��Our waitress was really rude, too. ��She refused to directly address my friend, who has Down Syndrome, and she was too busy chatting with her friends at the next table to serve our food on time. ��The food was horrible, too. ��How the hell did this place get the reputation for having the best sushi in town? ��WHAT A JOKE! ��Their seaweed salad tasted like it was sitting out all day, and the sushi wasn't fresh at all. �� Like Molly (reviewer below), I've had WAY better sushi at cheaper (and classier) restaurants. "
"Absolutely fan-friggin-tastic! The food is cheap and fast. It is made right in front of you from fresh ingredients. I was there last night for the first time with my new roommate, and I am in love with Sultan's Market! It fills you up, but doesn't leave you feeling weighed down or gross. It is a real find! I love the crazy lamps, too!"
"We've been there for dinner a few times. ��Great date spot. ��Also great for special occasions, such as birthdays or anniversaries. ��Excellent Mojitos. ��Flavorful food. ��Very cool atmosphere."
Piece was very good and pretty reasonable in price. Beer list is great. Would have been 5 stars but it was pretty crowded and fairly noisy.
DISGUSTING!!!!! don't go here. u r not only wasting ur $$$ but u are also gonna walk out w an upset stomach!
"Man This spot was worth the wait, I now know what it is to eat deep dish pizza. I had a shrimp and canadian bacon dish pizza and it was excellent."
"This was my first time having Ethiopian food, and honestly, I was impressed! it's weird at first because you aren't really eating so much as dipping a sponge like bread into different flavored sauces. You can order meat like beef or chicken to go with your entry. My favorite drink was the coffee. it was a Turkish blend and absolutely delicious. I have never had coffee quite like this before. I would recommend going if you are feeling bold and want to try something new. Oh, and did I mention that they are vegan friendly??"
"YUM. This place has the best Godzilla roll this side of Phoenix (just kidding. I've never been to Phoenix and I assume their sushi is bad). In all seriousness though, this place is great! The atmosphere is minimalist monochromatic, but I think that separates it from every other sushi restaurant in Chicago. Delivery is also well presented (and FAST) - the packaging and the preparation are leaps and bounds beyond the typical styrofoam mess from other restaurants. LOVE IT. Great job, Sushi X!"
I almost gave it three stars for the hours they keep. Late night options are limited and after midnight this place is definitely a three star choice but before that it is way too bland to be an option at all. I had ordered the same things a few times and it was remarkably consistantly bland. The salsa was hardly hot and the quesadillas lacked flavor.
"ABOLUTELY OVERRATED. I mean come on....this place is no Chicago Icon. I spent nearly 12$ on 2 people. Lets look at some things that show you how much better other places are1. Superdawg DOES NOT USE VIENNA BEEF, for 90% of people that is a �� ��dealbreaker right there.2. They have ketchup there. need i say more?3. meals for 2 people were almost 13$ Gene & Judes it is closer to 6$This place takes significantly longer to get your food than most places and the cashier lady seemed to hate her job very much. They are scamming you and making you pay for their useless drive in service. Stick to Gene and Judes this place is a joke."
"I took a date to Fogo de Chao for dinner and we had a great time. This is such a unique restaurant, from the amazing salad bar to their coaster signals, which are awesome and fun, to the waiters running around cutting meat right before your eyes. Meat. Mmmm.I think I definitely want to go back here again because the food is so good and the service is awesome. They did mention that lunch is a little less pricey, but who cares? It was an awesome experience, lots of fun, and we left feeling nice and full."
"I think this place is great. ��It reminds me of Italy, simple and easy. ��I will definatley go back if i'm in the nieghborhood but won't go outta my way. ��Unfortunatley in the chicagoland area we are spoiled by so many great pizza places that this is not one of my destination spots."
I've eaten here several times both for pleasure and for business and have never been disappointed. One of my favorite places in the city.
The Nanadict is by far one of my favorite breakfast dishes ever. I have to say the first time I ordered it I was a little nervous. I wasn't sure how it would all work together but omg. I am do glad I took the chance. It was soooo good that I have yet to have anything else because I just can't bring myself to order something else. My brother in law had the chilaquilles and he said it was really good also. ��I am really glad they opened a place like this do close to my house! Love it.
"The food is simple, but great! I had the vermicelli soup with pork belly--delicious! The service took longer than expected. They said it would take 30 minutes, but it actually took 50 minutes. Nothing extreme, I didn't mind waiting. It also can get crowded during lunch time. Best time to go is after 5pm."
"Made the trip out to Little Bucharest Bistro the other night to check out the restaurant. ��The facade, outdoor seating and fountain are quaint and were done very well. ��The interior as well is clean and quaint. ��Two menus were offered: one offering classic Romanian fare, the second being Chef Andre's menu. ��Having eaten at his last venture, it's amusing to see that this menu is more or less identical to his last, save some small changes. ��We ordered off of both menus. ��Iceberg wedge, gravlox and onion tart off Chef Andre's menu, sausage and cabbage rolls off of the classic menu. ��No complaints about the salad except that they used a wedge of romaine instead of iceberg. ��The gravlox was also well executed; my only suggestion would be to serve rye toast points to accompany the salmon and dec"
"The food was decent but nothing to rave about... especially for the price. ��I went with a group of 6 people and here is the census: I had the lobster fettuccine (noodles were undercooked) and it was pretty good but slightly bland, however there was an ample amount of Lobster which was nice. ��Two other people had BLT sandwich's which they said were very good. ��The rest of the group had the all u can eat bbq ribs... complaints were as follows, the ribs were very dry, one rack came out cold and the sauce was good but not anything to get all excited about. ��We also had soup and appetizers, which when we ordered the soup everyone had asked for a cup and they brought bowls which was a $2.00 difference for 6 people which added another $12.00 to the bill. ��We weren't thrilled, especially since the"
I heard about this place a while ago and tried to walk in once without reservations. ��Quick tip...they don't take walk ins! ��This isn't a problem...I just didn't know. �� ��My wife and I made our reservations and awaited our dinner (without the kids. ��Love'em...but not here) ��A few days before our dinner we received a call from the BonSoiree staff asking what course menu we would like to order...or pre-order. ��I wanted to get the 7 course for myself and the five course for my wife. ��They kindly let me know that the table must all order the same curse dinner. ��Hmmm....ok. ��The seven course it is. ��It was also nice that they asked if there were any substitutions for the table. ��I mentioned my wife didn't like venison and would like something else. ��They were more than accommodating with this r
"Horrible food and even worse service! This place was okay in the past, but now it really went way down!I ordered something for lunch that clearly was not fresh, to say the least. The server did not care one bit and neither did the manager! In the end they even charged me for the food I DID NOT EAT due to ��health concerns.Can you imagine worse than this? Let me tell you that I couldn't be nicer about the whole thing while there and even paid my bill. I did work in a restaurant in the past and I know it is hard work, but HORRIBLE SERVICE AND EVEN WORSE FOOD is inexcusable."
"Love, love, love this place. ��Great looking place, serving yummy organic food. ��This family really has put there heart into this restaurant. ��I want to mention how awesome the chilaquiles are... can you say mmmn. ��My mouth waters at the thought of them. ��I also enjoyed a nice carmel latte, which puts starbucks to shame. ��This family is something from Nana herself right down to her grandchild, whom I believe calls her Nana. ��I waited a bit for my food, but I suppose that is to be expected being the first week. ��I must say that I didn't mind the wait... I had the beautiful sister as my server who was very accommodating. ��She certainly loves her brothers and actually cares about any feedback to help them succeed. This is my new favorite place. ��Bravo to the brothers and keep up the good work,"
"This place is always ��busy and crowded,but the food is worth the wait.Chessecake Factory is it's affiliate. It is a couple of notches above the Chessecake Factory. I gave it 5 stars,a great place to take friends,also great for a date."
"Ruth's Chris has good steaks and all the sides. ��This is one of the better steaks I have had in the city. ��I have had a little better service at other steak houses in the city though which is the only reason I am giving them a four verses a five star. ��I know this is a chain which is something I try to avoid when I can, but they did have a good steaks."
The food is out of this world there! I love it
"We have been going to Sushi X and carrying out since they opened! We love the double stack, yellow jacket, and white tiger. ��Their dumplings are very good and love the spicy sauce it comes with!! ��Stephen, one of the managers, is great and always very kind to us. ��If you haven't tried it yet you must and it's BYOB!!"
"Love the food in this restaurant, specially the juicy churrasco. I wish i could come more often as it is a little pricey for me. The margaritas are fantastic too!"
Love this place. Been coming to Garcia's for several years.There burritos is out of this world .
"Great spot, easy location. ��Sushi is great for Chicago and this place is BYOB. ��Atmosphere here is fun and upbeat. ��Roll variety offers everything you want and few fun new options to try."
"Not sure what more can be said about this place!! It was a long wait, but damn well worth it. Potato dog with havarti cheese is my go to..I've tried some of the sausages too and they are fantastic. you really cannot GO WRONG!!"
"Service was excellent! Food was excellent. My husband and I split the steak and Shrimp DeJogne Many foods to choose from, Desserts were good, too - highly recommended! ..."
"60 types of Brick Oven Pizza, and great Charbroiled Chicken..You just don't see any place around that does what Fogo does as well as they do it...You would think that 1 would be better than the other, but our family just loves all their food. Sundays have become our Whole Chicken Dinner day from Fogo, and Thursday or Fridays are our Fogo pizza night. The staff knows us by name, and you can tell that they know ��a lot of regulars by name. The Buffalo Chicken, Prosciuto and Arugula, and Quatro Formaggi are probably our most ordered pizzas, but sometimes the kids just want a good old Pepperoni or Sausage(good sausage on theirs). �� ��We have noticed that the restaurant keeps getting busier and busier, which is great to see in a little family business. We do call ahead to get in and out quickly f"
"There pizza is some of the best I have found in the city. Very taste, fresh ingredents, pizza by the slice ready to go, delevery is fast and they wrap the pizza in foil to make sure no cheese is lost in a pizza slide or to the top of the box. Free pop with delevery, I got to tell you of all food Pizza is what I'm the biggest food snob about. So if you have had Art of Pizza, next time you have a craving try them!!!"
THANK YOU Alliance!!!Saturday we were surprised by a delivery of an absolutely GORGEOUS chocolate ganache cake from Alliance. ��They do amazing work. ��And it tasted even better than it looked (if that's even possible). ��A delicious work of art!
"Not much to add that hasn't already been said! This place is amazing, I live in MA but travel to see family in Chicago frequency and make Hot Doug's a must for each trip! Lines can be long, but don't let it scare you, worth the wait. Prices are insanely cheap as well. Pretty sure I remember it being cash only."
"Glenn's. . .oh Glenn's. I started yelp yesterday and I thought, how do I not rant about my favorite seafood joint. I mean every time I make a new friend. At some point or another I have the conversation So have you been to Glenn's? no what's that? The most awesome seafood place ever, I mean 15 different kinds of seafood awesome. Cheesy? Maybe, I am. I never cared. But seriously this place has the best food around and it's so close to the brown line. I have to say the sturgeon and the tuna are my absolute favorites here. But the service, impeccable. Shauma, she is the best waitress. My room mate and I love her. She's funny and social but not overbearing. And I never have a empty water glass. Bottom line, literally. If you want amazing seafood paired with a Mimosa and great service, go to Gl"
"I really liked the food and the professional service. The steak was perfectly cooked (mr) and not smothered in sauce. The room was OK and the atmosphere OK as well. While there was nothing particularly interesting about the menu or the ambiance, everything was well-executed."
"My pleasant experiences at Mia Francesca's have never ended. Every time I go we have a wonderful time and are treated like royalty. The first time I went I had only been living in Chicago for a few months and my dad was up to visit. I made the reservations on the recommendation of my boss and wasn't sure what to expect. When we got there, we had a bit of a wait so we ordered a couple of glasses of wine at the bar. Our drinks were empty and the manager immediately came over and got us two new glasses for free, he then led us to the upstairs more private area of the restaurant. Honestly, the pasta I had that night was the best pasta dish I have ever had. The menu is constantly changing, but I've been lucky enough to get it once more since then. While we were eating I mentioned to the manager"
"Great food, but too loud and crowded to enjoy it."
"Love their deep dish, freaking great! Not necessarily the best in Chicago but its still pretty damn good."
"Uncommon Ground has been a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. ��We go here quite a bit with the kids since we live right around the corner and every time we are greeted with a warm welcome and accommodating staff. ��The menu varies seasonally, ingredients are sourced locally (whenever possible) from sustainable farms. I also like how green this place is, it inspires me to try just a little bit more. ��In the summer they have a farmer's market on Fridays in the parking lot. ��There is always an eclectic mix of people, mixed in with young families and somehow it always works. ��For Breakfast/Brunch, I'm a huge fan of their Breakfast melt (although it sometimes comes out cold) or their beef hash. ��Their spiked coffee drinks are delicious and varied based on season. ��For Lunch, try the grown u"
Very good service and good food. Nice cozy restaurant..overall it is fantastic...Concierge (Courtyard Marriott Mag Mile)
"The meat is amazing. The salad bar is to die for. Dessert is superb.But the best part is the service. Your drinks will never be emplty, your plate will always be full, and everything is served with a smile. It is a great place for a special occasion."
What's great:- Gnocchi- Wine- Craft beer options- Opener salads- Spoonable beefWhat's not: - Can be hard to get into during dinner hours- Can be loudNow one of my three favorite places in the city.
"COMEDY OF ERRORS. First of all, we went to Sun Wah when it was in its original location and thoroughly enjoyed the duck and the service. We recommended the place to numerous friends and were looking forward to our next trip. We were extremely disappointed with our last visit. ��In most restaurants-- including dives-- there are some basic elements we all have come to expect: namely, some semblance of organization. At Sun Wah, it was chaos. We showed up for our 8PM reservation and here is what we saw: hoards of confused people crowding the doorway, no apparent host or manager escorting people to tables or taking names, open tables waiting to be cleared for 10 minutes at a time, and numerous parties waiting either for their food or for their check. When we thought we found the ""host"" and inqui"
very good variety of hot dog flavors / combinations. buns could be better.
"I'm going to have to agree with @Jeff on this one, I ordered 2 shakes and 2 slices of cheese & sausage pizzas. Well needless to say im really surprised about all the positive reviews, to begin the crust on the pizza was soo 'crackery' by that i mean pretty much it was alot like eating a thick saltine cracker it would break apart easily i think most-likely has to do with the dough they use to make it. Next the pizza itself had very little to almost no sauce and a mountain of cheese... I mean don't get me wrong i love cheese but this portion was enough to elevate ones cholesterol sky high, needless to say i really like there decor and all however i don't understand why they make there customers wait almost half an hour for some reheated pizza? As for the milkshake it was nothing special plus"
"This place would get a 5 if it wasnt so crowded and their beer selection was a little bigger. But aside from that this place is great. Very good music, sunday night poetry is always fun and the place has a great aged feel to it. TIp: they allow you to bring food in or order in. So get there early, have a few drinks and order dinner in. Unfortuantly thats one of the only ways to get a good seat at this popular joint =/"
"My girlfriend and I have been here a few times now and have had a great experience everytime. ��The food has been delicious, the service satisfactory if not great and the ambience quaint and friendly. The menu is filled with delicious twists on some familiar dishes. ��The salads are fresh and delicious and the pastas are always cooked perfectly al dente with very flavorful sauces. ��The onion tarte amuse bouche that comes complimentary after use sit down is also a fantastic bonus.If you are looking for a great dining experience Anteprima will not disappoint."
"This place is alright. The server was good, the food was good as well. When I called to make a reservation for by boyfriends birthday, the girl who answered the phone was very, very rude. I almost canceled the reservation, but the boyfriend really wanted to go. I have been to 2 other similar-concept restaurants which were MUCH better. I wouldn't go back knowing there is better out there."
"A great place for a relaxed meal, coffee, wine or drink. The service is wonderful and friendly. I enjoy each visit I make here as well as all of the artwork. Great breakfast - really nice menu and wine list. Definitely becoming one of my regular stops!"
"Food is great, drinks are great and service is great... the one bartender with the carefully calculated mustache and glasses is kind of obnoxious to deal with. Overall fantastic."
It was perfect. It's a small place and super busy but still was able to seat a table of 11 on a saturday night (after a small wait). As the other reviews will tell you the food is great and it's the perfect place for carnivores and vegans to coexist and share a bottle of wine from home with no corking fee.
Every time I go to Chicago I go to Maggianos! ��I love their pizza and the Restaurants are very cool the atmosphere is so old school. ��It is a very fun place to go and eat.
"This event occurred during the Holiday season this past year, but occurs every time we frequent this place. ��The foods great and I can't say enough about it, but every time we go it's a 30+ minute wait just to get in! ��You sit out in the cold and it's annoying, you think your entering some hot club but it's just a diner...they really need to expand or get a new building or something cause it's just a joke (anytime between 5pm and close, it's awful) just this alone makes me shutter at the idea of going back, but wait there's more! ��The space is always cramped. ��Once you get in (don't slip on the kitchen floor) you get sat at a table that is roughly 2ft by 2ft so never order a full course meal. ��The last time my date and I got an appetizer, tea, and a full meal (sandwich and salad).The tea a"
"Hands Down one of the best restaurants this city has to offer. AMAZING food, and service. That's it. Nothing more to say about it."
Best Hot dogs in Chicago hands down.Fries cooked in duck fat only on Friday and Saturday. ( Awesome) The foei gras dog... out of this world....The dogs were very tasty.Loved the small cozy restaurant.....

"Grand Lux Cafe is my go-to restaurant when I have friends or family visiting the city. This place has EVERYTHING. You can have specialty drinks, wine, and appetizers in the bar or you can have a nice sit down meal. I like this place because it is not as expensive as other nicer Michigan Avenue restaurants but the waitstaff and hosts make you feel like a million dollars.My friend recommended this place and we paid for her food because she did good by taking us there. ��I had the Asian salad, it was the best salad I've ever had. �� You'll see all walks of life in that place from beach goers to people who seem to be on a romantic date. ��Totally recommend this place for any type of outing, casual or a bit more upscale. ��I will definitely will be going back, it's very much like the Cheesecake Fac"
"Consistently great. ��This place is run like a machine, with waiters all over the place and food delivered without a long wait. ��The place is huge, and it is always packed. ��Festive atmosphere, with Opa! yelled throughout. ��The saganaki is a must-have, and the basic Greek chicken (riganati) is excellent. ��Never been to the location in Lombard, but the Greektown location (Halsted and Adams) is outstanding. ��Great for a date, a business lunch, or a family dinner."
"I have very mixed feelings about Glenn's Diner. A few weeks ago the bf and I took a nice evening stroll to find a place to grab dinner. Bowman's was packed and Lincoln Square had some sort of festival so we headed east on Montrose hoping to find something but having nothing specific in mind.We came upon Glenn's Diner. My only experience with Glenn's prior was that of two of my out-of-town guests had found Glenn's when left to their own devices and without my supervision and came back saying that best food in the world was a complete misnomer and that cereal boxes did not constitute a diner. Therefore, I was skeptical when bf said, let's try it!It was a beautiful summer evening, they have a patio and anything beyond Ravenswood was not tempting me so I said, sure.We sat outside and when I gl"
"Great food!Great service!This isn't the most romantic place. But if your looking to leave and impression and stuff your face with a gigantic salad bar and all the meat you can eat, then this is the place to be. The drinks are superb by the way as well!"
"good thinking.1- change your hours without notifying anyone publishing them(took a bus to go there for lunch and it was closed)2- stop delivering without telling your employees(just sat on the phone ordering to hear they dont deliver no more its even on their website that they deliver)3- raise menu prices (they just raised last week apparently)$47 for a soup, veggies, and fettucini.no thanks- ill cut up garlic and add olive oil myself"
"Garcia's sucks. Used to be decent, cheep and convenient (and dirty). They did a very strange rehab: the outside now looks like a bad suburban McMansion/fortress and the inside is a giant open space with worn out old furniture. The new space is painfully loud and messier than the old place. The hostess and the other waiters seat people randomly--some people seat themselves (even if there is a 30 minute wait list-the oversize guys bully the hostess and/or bartender). If you are looking for Mexican, go elsewhere."
"The outdoor patio is lovely and the service was relatively attentive, if a bit slow. As Sapori has so many glowing reviews on here, and is often very busy, I was surprised at how disappointed I was ��by the food. The homemade pasta in the seafood spaghetti tasted and looked like Ramen noodles. It was about 5 minutes past al-dente, which is simply unacceptable for a $22 plate of pasta. Then there was the sauce: appalling! Tasted exactly like Chef Boyardee; if it wasn't from a can it sure tasted like it was. The seafood was ok, but overcooked as much as the pasta was.My date had lasagna--same nasty sauce, but had beef in it, so tasted like the beef version of Chef Boyardee. Also $20.Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you: what's with all the glowing reviews? This place stinks for the price point. Ma"
The line wasn't as bad as expected. We waited about 25 minutes a little after 12:30p.m. It was worth the wait. The short rib torta was very flavorful and was seasoned well. I was a little upset with the little amount of guacamole they give with the chips though. The cubana my friend had was excellent! A must try if your in the hood!
"OK so I went Demera last night again I was there on saturday night too. �� the reason why i went ��there because of the food! ��THE ��food was ��so delicous. so let me write the negative side..... The service WAS SO BAD!! ��on saturday it was kinda busy but still none of them ��were didn't ��pay attention for us! what a bad service I had! plus Last night?? come on it was not even busy we treated by rude waitress the other one looked so weired lol ��the service in Demera was not friendly,helpfull at all.the servers need more EXPERIENCE!!! �� ��Overall, i might go back one day but not very soon! yakkkkkkkkk"
"I really wanted to like this restaurant... we went for Lunch, and ordered the chef's selection of tapas , offered for $35 a person. ��We got about 8 different dishes altogether, but it seemed like a lot of vegetables and not so much ��meat ( and no cheeses). �� Although everything tasted fine, ��I found the dishes a bit on the skimpy side, and all of us left still hungry. ��Our waiter was very slow and disappeared for 20 minutes at a time, although the service staff ( water, bringing out dishes, etc) was very good. ��At the end , we had to wait about 15 minutes more just to get our check ... after sitting there for 2 hours, we were ready to go ! SO ... not a lot of food for the money, ��poor service, honestly, there are a lot of better tapas places in Chicago."
"I'm a Chinese American who enjoys spicy food. ��Lao Sze Chuan is unfortunately the closest you can get in Chinatown for authentic Sze Chuan style Chinese food. ��However, the closest you can get is still far from being great. �� I used to go there at least once a month. ��But the food quality has been going down hill for the paste few years. ��The taste is very inconsistent. ��The exact same dish could taste very different the next time you go. ��And the worst of all is their service. ��If you are Asian, especially Chinese, you will be treated very differently. ��Last time some friends and I went, the waitress came to our table several times and asked if we had done. ��We realized that there was a line at the door and we were the only Chinese dinners. ��I will never go to this horrible place again."
Great burger bar. ��One of the best in Chicago. ��For starters there is a great beer list by tap and bottle. ��There are some creative cocktails as well. ��Try the cigarette and hot sauce. ��The cheese curds are awesome and the different burgers are great. ��I had Elvis's last supper which had peanut butter an bacon. ��Totally worked. ��One great thing is the burger to bun ratio is perfect.....bun all the way to the last bite.
"The BEST Korean Restaurant.I go here every time I go to Chicago...They give you tray full of sides (different kinds of kimchis) & miso soup with most dishes.The only thing I dislike would be their parking space... It's soo small, I feel like, my car will get a scratch from parking there. (but that's not gonna affect their food)In the end, their food is excellent. P.S. They are open until 5am. That's gotta be the best."
What a great place! ��I've been here 3 or 4 times and every meal is better than the last. ��Service is excellent and $30/tuesday night special is truly a value. ��Plus they are BYOB! What's not to love?
"Well worth the wait. Some of the best chicago style pizza I've ever had and washed down with some ""honkers"" (a local brew) possibly the best meal I ever had. No complaints whatsoever. A+."
Wow - possibly the goofiest restaurant i've ever been to. ��This place is trying so hard to be something that it hurts to look at it. ��The food is totally average and there isn't an ounce of service. ��It's expensive for what it is and such a let down.
"This place is a toss up for me. I think the atmosphere is cozy, but a bit on the bleak side and not too comfortable. The crab appetizer is my favorite. Ask for the special crab in a wonton wrapped, worth every penny. The sushi is good, but a bit overrated."
"Well, I can't agree with Bruce A. that this place is the best italian in the city but it is up there. ��The space is nice on the inside but the outside is perfect. ��What happens in the winter when it's just the indoor space?Our group had the antipasto platter to start and all good flavors, from the fresh proscuitto to the grilled veggies. ��I had the parpardelle pasta with the veal ragu- and it was DELICIOUS!! ��My friends had the risotto and the fish special of the night and both said they enjoyed their meal. ��I truly want to give this place 4.5stars but you have to choose between 4 or 5 and 5 is far to high for any place unless they shine my shoes whiles dining.Give it a try, you'll be happy and leave feeling like you got your monies worth."
This place is amazing! Great service and an excellent dining experience. I discovered Las Tablas through a groupon that a friend shared with me. We went on a week night and were seated immediately. The staff was incredibly friendly and very helpful at making suggestions and explaining the menu. We both had the Combinaciones with their Entrana skirt steak and grilled shrimp. It was delicious! The steak was cooked perfectly and the sauces were very flavorful. I also had a Refajo which was a new and tasty experience for me. I can't wait to bring my husband here. He will love it!
i was there only once but it was by far the most spectacular dining experience in a restaruant i have ever had.
"Simply the best food in a mile radius. ��My family often needs quick, good, economical food. ��We always go to Simply IT because we never leave without great food made from the freshest ingredients. ��The owners are always onsite and extremely friendly. ��The amount of food you receive for the value is extraordinary and the favors are wonderful. ��And don't forget a smoothy with Bubble Tea or their ginger tea."
"I have no other experiences with Vietnamese food so my review should be treated as novice at best.(Although I eat food...everyday) ��That being said this restaurant made no impression on me at all. ��I like BYOB places and this is a BYOB place, so it works."
"My friend and I ordered a few specialty rolls (Firecracker, Number Nine, Lobster and Pig roll that had bacon on it) and an appetizer (a tuna avocado salad) and loved everything we ordered. ��It is pricey but we both were raving about how delicious everything was. ��I have already booked my next reservation."
"A fantastic meal. ��The small things make it work here. ��From the sauterene with foie, to the cheese plate with white wine, to the special after dinner drink all part of th $60.00 prix fixe. ��You have to love it. ��A great great find, and Chef Dale and Chef Sara make some sweet food. Love it."
"A lovely, inexpensive lunch in Wicker Park. The falafel sandwiches are delish and the crowd is laid-back and fun to watch. It does suck that they don't take plastic, but I have this small obsession with the idea that lunches taste better (and films are more enjoyable, sweaters are prettier, &tc) when paid for in cash. So it's aright with me."
"Yes I am hard to please, but what's wrong with that. ��Just because I go back to a place a few times doesn't mean it is great, and the converse is true also - just because I don't go all the time doesn't mean it sucks. ��Irazu is right in the middle. ��I go every once in a while not because it is exceptional in any real way, it is just fairly solid food that usually is seasoned pretty well at a price point that leaves little room for complaining even if it is less than perfect. ��You kinda need a place or three like that in your life, one that falls off the radar screen until you drive down Milwaukee, remember you are hungry, make a mental note to stop in sometime soon, finally stop in for a bite a week later, wait too long for your simple peasant food, then finish a not-so-bad torta & oatmeal"
"I and a group of friends were at Gilt Bar this past week end. ��My experience was really great, fresh well prepared food, lovely service, and a beautiful environment. ��I just read some reviews here, also I guess about this past week end, that sounded like they were at a different restaurant. �� ��Besides that, they ��didn't even make sense. One hated it so much they had to stay two hours. ��Another stayed three. ��It must have been just awful for them, as well as confusing, as they said they were planning on coming back. They sounded really angry. ��It makes you wonder. We ordered a variety of plates so we could share and they were large enough for all 4 of us. My favorites were the pate, scallops and steak but others went for the pasta dishes and salads. I'm not a big drinker but I liked the coc"
"Great Service!!!! Ordered the costum cake last minute (cake not from theyr website) they said ""Sure no problem we can do it"" I wouldhighly recomendem them!"
The food is excellent and delicious. The staff attempts to be as attentative as possible. The only thing that keeps this place from being five stars is its tight seating arrangements and crowd. If you are feeling patient then this is a great place to go.
Our son and his bride chose Mercat a la Planxa for their rehearsal dinner on 8/20/2009 and it was fantastic! ��Service was superb - attentive but not intrusive and the food delicious; we had a private room overlooking the restaurant. ��Our wedding guests were all staying at The Blackstone so frequented Mercat and were also very pleased as it was a natural for all to meet in the bar or the restaurant. ��Simply excellent!
"Food here is amazing, definitely a great experience. ��Eating here is somewhat like what I would imagine eating on Top Chef to be like, you dont get to order but the food is so good it doesnt matter. �� The venue is pretty small so book reservations early as they fill up quickly especially on weekends. ��A bit pricey but the fact that its BYOB is nice as it allows what is usually the most marked up thing to be purchased cheaper. ��Overall a great place."
Totally not worth the price bad service right off the bat.
"Recommended to me by a friend. ��It brings back all the memories of growing up in the South.Tonight they had a flounder special that was sensational!!!...stuffed with crab, melt-in-your-mouth good.Wonderful staff! ��Can't wait to go back to try their brunch!!You have to try the red velvet martini...if you like chocolate!Don't miss this place!!!!"
"This place has consistently delivered very tipical colombian and ecuadorian food for a very long time. Get a matrimonio and some red wine and you will expirience a great meal. Very casual and of course, muy latino."
"Wow. ��First, I can't say enough nice things about the staff. ��Every single person I had any interaction with at Zed 451 was extremely nice. ��My wife and I went here for my birthday dinner and we were treated like royalty. ��Warning: be prepared to eat like there's no tomorrow. ��I was unable to make it through all 12 courses AFTER going to the extremely posh buffet for charcuterie and appetizers. ��The poke (pronounced poh-kay) sticks out in my mind as being fantastic. ��So does the cured duck, apricots in a vanilla cinnamon sauce, and the boursin cheese soup. ��(the truffle butter and tangerine butter was tasty too)The main course food is served in a Brazilian manner, but that is pretty much all it has to do with Brazil. ��The menu is eclectic and creative. ��The in-house cured meats are great. "
"Piccolo Sogno is one of my favorite places to go. ��Probably why I chose to write my first review on Yelp... (I've relied on Yelp to search for anything and everything.. finally decided to contribute)Service is great and the food is absolutely delicious--I even crave their balsamic vinegar and olive oil. *nod* I know... I pretty much finish everything laid out in front of me whenever I go.Insalata de pere is light yummy-good to start the meal... their pizza is great. Crispy and thin-- and cheesy and melty. I've had many entrees, pasta, pizza, fish here-- but my all time favorite is stracci di farro. Last time we went, the server asked if we wanted white truffle shavings added for $10 extra, and while I thought.. hmm.. is it worth it? It was definitely worth it. ��From appetizer to dessert, i"
"Overrated!I couldn't believe the calamari appetizer was $11 (I was thinking then it must be the best calamari ever, or very huge. But it was neither) $11? Seriously?Outside seating is nice!Bathroom upstairs was gross. It IS a unisex, but it smelled like piss & the floor was dirty."
"Sun Wah was a fantastic dining experience. ��As others have said, the Peking Duck was amazing. ��Our small group arrived at 6 and by the time we left, there was a significant wait. ��I would definitely recommend arriving early or making a reservation."
"I allow myself this bit of heaven every once in awhile. All I can say is heaven on a bun. Every single fantastic creation my lips have ever tasted have been memorable to say the least. There is a reason for all the great reviews. Get your butt over to HD's, just be ready to wait in that line. Worth it!!"
"Solid 'down & dirty' mexican fare. ��Service was a bit slow, but the place was packed, so I'll definitely give them another shot!"
why oh why does your internet go out all the time? great cupcakes
"Oompa!!! The Ouzo shots are great here, as well as the food, which comes in huge portions.Their chicken egg soup is to die for.Good for groups."
Pretty good food. ��Never tastes the same for some reason. ��I do however frequent this establishment often. ��Fair prices. ��Seems to be getting busier and busier each time I stop in. ��Not the best Mexican food in the City but far from the worst.
"I love their steak torta sandwich (excellent bread) and ground beef empanada. ��It's the BEST steak torta I've ever had! ��I won't order their pineapple/spinach empanadas and plantain again. ��We also ordered cheese empanada but the cheese was missing. ��I would go back just to have their steak torta, ground beef empanada and flan!"
"I went to this restaurant for the first time last week and I was 'bowled' over. ��The food was delicious, the prices very reasonable--I was so impressed. ��The staff was helpful. ��Great food presentation, nice atmosphere. ��I will be taking my daughter there for dinner soon. ��Can't wait!"
"This restaurant was fantastic. It's hard to find words that define this place to what it deserves. It was amazing. The staff was really nice and cared about how everything was going. The food was so different and served in such an interesting manner it was great, the experience was one of a kid. There is a never ending array of meet coming to you constantly so make sure to come when your very hungry. The owner is also really pleasant and he comes to your table to see how everything is going and hes great. Everything was just wonderful."
Excellent food. Everything is fresh. Excellent delivery service. Friendly staff.
"I would give it 2 stars but for the price, i wouldn't go back, service average food from decent to bad, portions mostly small, desert - a let down. ��yeah. not going to try it again unless it's free"
"I live around the corner and have always gone to Wilde for just drinks. But, my mom was in town this past week and we went there on Friday night for dinner. We had to wait quite a while for a table, but it was worth it. My mom had the chicken curry and I had the roasted chicken. The portions were large and the food was great. I'll definitely go back..."
The meal was wonderful. ��I was quickly seated and I can see how that might be a problem there. ��The place is packed always and rightfully so. ��The meal was quick and the Pho was perfect in flavor. ��My only wish is a bit more flank. ��Maybe I recieved a poor amount or maybe I was served the correct amount. ��I've been to Pho shops in Cali and received a lot more beef. ��Either way the flavor was dead on and the seating wasn't instant but fast enought. ��It beats the wait at Panda Express or P.F. Changs and the taste is authentic. ��If you want some decent Pho then this is the place to hit.
"A great, new spot in Lincoln Park for people who love local meats, seafood, cheeses, veggies and wines, but want all of those options 100% organic? ? FINALLY! ? :^) ? ?Have been watching the place get set up and open...and this place has been worth the wait. ?Came in over the weekend with three of my close friends after chatting with one of their waiters for a bit on the phone about the menu and learning what Sprout is all about. ? It was great to hear about the 100% organic casual elegance mantra that they claimed to have, but I wasn't going to be convinced until I left the restaurant and had that long sought after Wow, now THAT was good feeling.Only a couple other tables in the restaurant were filled when we arrived early that evening, but there was a comfortable vibe going on that was e"
A little Havanna off of Western. It was a little dicey parking but well worth it. The atmosphere was very nice & prices were very cheap. The servers were nice & I left with a great feeling inside. Defineately worth a return trip
"I have been here 3 times. ��Each time I feel like a king. ��They treat each customer like it might be their last. ��My wife wanted a dessert that was not on the menu, the manager had a bus boy run across the street and get it from the bakery...I have never heard of such good service. ��My steak and lobster is good everytime I get it, they really know how to run a restaraunt. ��Can't wait til my next visit."
"Nice location. ��You can see and smell the wonderful wood roasted meat as you approach the restaurant window. ��Nice comfortable, contemporary environment. ��Easy on the eyes. ��Top notch service. ��They will turn the world upsidedown to assist. ��Knowledgeable and warm staff. ��Start with the Caipirinha and have a couple. ��Move onto the salad bar. ��Fresh, wonderful variety. ��Great starting point for the meal ahead, but don't fill up there. ��You have 20 different kinds of meat to sample. ��The Gauchos are quick and visible so you don't sit long before they're bringing you more meat. ��Nice aspect to the service is that if you prefer top sirloin and lamb chops, that' s all they'll offer you until you ask them to stop. ��It's all about you and what you want. ��Last time I was there, I ordered an expens"
I adore Chinese food and here I found some of the most amazing and deliciously prepared meals. Ambient is great and cozy and I will definitely come back again.
"I had dinner ��the second night of their opening and it was FANTASTIC! ��Me and my partner had the sprout salad, crab cakes, rolled leg of lamb and the tenderloin dinner. The space is very nice and the music was funky-lounge. ��Very gay-friendly! ��Great staff and the organic riesling was to die for. ��My only negative comment would be that more people need to know about this hidden! ��We will definitely be back for more!"
"ate here last night, wow it was good i had the firecracker, i def recommend it. also had this amazing sake, tyku. yum yum yum. I will def be heading back here. love the community seating. oh my guess make reservations. i cant tell you how much i loved the firecracker."
Delicious. ��Crowded but totally worth it. ��AMAZING margs & with half price pitchers on Tuesday & Thursdays it's great!
"Came in tonight and was pleasantly surprised to see that they had a table open for us. On weekends, it's a lot busier than on the weekdays, which is when I usually come. I'm happy for the owner, Tuan, who says it's a lot more stable during the weekends than during the week days. Come on, Yelpers! Help this fine establishment out (me as well! I always need my fix of Simply It).Previous experiences, as well as tonight, have always been extraordinary. The service is wonderfully enthusiastic, the food is deliciously appetizing, and the atmosphere is heartwarming.As a regular, I would say that my favorite dishes would have to be the Simply It's Beef or the Shrimp Sate. However, I always like to vary my dishes every once in a while; none of them have disappointed, in portion size or taste. What "
"I don't think there is anything on their menu I haven't tried, they have reasonable prices. It just depends on what you get, but I can't get enough of the pomegranate wings!! Man I stop in here at least two times out the week for them, I recommend you try them, plus they ain't that expensive. ��And this isn't food you can get anywhere, they have unique dishes, just come try it the taste speaks for it's self."
"Great Cuban sandwich and maduros! ��Cute place, excellent takeout service. ��Looking forward to trying more on the menu on our next trip."
"One of Chicago's worst.Food was mediocre. Worse, I ordered two beers that were both flat and tasted like soap. Reviewer before nailed it -- they try to create a line to make the place look cool. And the doorman is just an a-hole. As we were leaving -- he was screeching like a schoolgirl at the people in what appeared to be a very orderly line to ""listen"" to him -- or they weren't getting in. Leave this one to the tourists!"
The duck fat fries are worth the wait. ��Yes there are lines at lunch time out the door. ��Get there before 11:30am
"We haven't been to Greek Islands for over 10 years, but we used to really love the food. ��Our family just visited Greeek Islands this week and unfortunately we were disappointed. ��We ordered the Family Plate. ��The food was good, but we were surprised at how sparse the amount of gyro and lamb meat were along with the other parts of the main entree. ��We actually walked away wanting to more of our favorites. ��Maybe we needed to order an extra serving of each though the waiter said the meal would be large.We may try one of the other local Greek restaurants next time to compare."
"I used to be a regular at Glenn's. ?Every weekend, my girlfriend and I would go there for brunch. ?The last several visits have been a big disappointment though. ?After the reconfiguration, the seating became tight and uncomfortable. ?Secondly the service went from being friendly to surly. ?Finally the quality of the food and service has taken a huge nose dive! Three times I had made advanced reservations, for a moderate-sized group (six people) and two out of three times a table wasn't ready for us, in fact, we had to wait more than a half hour for our table! ?On one such occasion, when we had an advanced reservation, there was an open table reserved for a same sized group behind us, yet they didn't make any adjustments to sit us and give the group behind us the table. ?We were forced to "
"This is one of the best restaurants I have been to in a while!!!! ��The southern cuisine and ambiance brought a little Creole/French Quater to Chicago! �� All the ingredients were fresh and all flavors complimented one another. �� This effect is becoming scarcer in restaurants these days with failed attempts at ""fusion"" recipes. ��Sometimes we have to stick with staples and get back to the basics and stop reinventing the wheel. ��I definitely recommend my meal - Sorghum-Glazed Chicken. ��The meat was juicy - full of flavor, skin was crispy, grits were rich and creamy and the greens brought a light comfortable - smooth balance. ��I'll definitely be going back. ��Great job guys - keep up the good work!"
"Do not go to Caro Mio if you like real Italian cooking. ��The sauces on the meats overpower the taste, the salad was wilted by the vinegar ( I actually put bread onto the salad plate to soak up the dressing) and the pasta stuck together! ��You get what you pay for. ��This probably serves the locals well but it is not for an educated palate. ��Service is uneven. ��The only positive is the BYOB policy. ��I had a great wine!"
sooo good!
"When we visit this is one of the first places we go. Quaint, very good service and delicious food. Simply great !"
"Dined here last night and had an absolutely excellent time. I am a young diner (still in high school!), from Northwest Indiana. I come to Chicago every few weeks to get my food fix. This trip, I brought along three friends and headed to Graham Elliot. The restaurant was modern, as I expected, and definitely had a quirky and eccentric vibe to it. They even serve the wine in giant Erlenmeyer flasks! The music is great too, and definitely seems to cater to the younger crowd. From what I've read and from my experience, it seems like the staff at Graham Elliot is all very young and clever. Our server certainly was. She was absolutely excellent--perhaps one of the best servers I've ever had. Often, teenagers are treated condescendingly in upscale restaurants such as this one, but she was complet"
"nostalgic and fun, but seriously overpriced. a hot dog and a drink really shouldn't cost me more than 3 bucks. but this place is pretty good. the tomato is pretty original and the hot dog is good, but a little big for my taste. if the prices were lower, i'd go here more often."
"We LOVE Rick Bayless' ��show, and have wanted to go for a while. We went to Frontera Grill for my 50th Birthday celebration. Let's start with, couldn't make reservation way in advance, stood waiting for 2 and 3/4 hours in a crowded bar area without ever getting to sit. $12 glass of wine ridiculous. Reasonable margaritas that were very good. Wait staff was nice. Coat check girl GREAT. Bar staff nice. The food for (including drinks through the night and tips) 4,at over $300, terrible. The food was not good enough that we would ever return there. The chicken portion tiny, the chicken enchiladas gamey, the shrimp enchiladas had tough shrimp in them. The guac was great but small serving size. The front staff was rude. If it were not for the great company that I was with, I would have walked out."
This is the worst place i have ever been to the owner is a jerk he yells at every one in front of customers he treats his staff like slaves and one of the waitress even told me he steals there tips. Don't eat here no one should support a man like this and there food is over priced and really salty
"We went to Sunda recently and were seated right away. The decor is beautiful with a modern asian touch. ��We arrived early, but by the time we left the restaurant was full and becoming very loud. The food was outstanding. Absolutely delicious and beautiful presented. We would absoultely recommend this restaurant. Try the beef lollipops!"
"I stumbled upon Geja's a few years ago and have since gone for dates, anniversaries, friends' birthdays, and dinner dates with girlfriends who are visiting from the suburbs for a child-free night out. ��it's my favorite restaurant for its atmosphere, staff, music, and delicious food (the cheese is my favorite, and I often find myself ravenously craving it if I haven't had it in a while!). �� Some other peoples' reviews seemed misguided, and as an experienced geja's diner, perhaps I can shed some light: the booths are great, but they are first come-first serve because EVERYONE wants them. ��I appreciate that the hosts do not hold them open--it seems fair to me. ��On certain nights when sitting in one of the romantic booths is important to me, we gladly wait at the bar and indulge on cheese & cr"
"Not that impressed at all. Very pricy, I'm from Texas so we get a lot of gulf seafood ��but the lobster bisque was excellent"
"Went Sat. night with a friend, excited from reviews. ��lousy meal. Tried the hot/sour soup with pork blood cakes. ��Soup was not hot (spicy) or sour, and the cakes were tofu (no real taste) - the soup itself was a clear cabbage broth, with too much salt and pepper (regular table pepper, not chili pepper). ��Silly us for thinking it would be a regular hot/sour soup with more interesting bits in it. Spicy eggplant with pork was good, average, hardly spicy, nothing special. ��His lamb w/cumin dish was okay, but lamb was not very tasty, and if you want this type of meal, go to a middle eastern restaurant where they do it right. ��I had fish with chili? sauce - recommended by waitress, and I swear it was a bunch of fish mcnuggets drenched in a ketchupy sweet bbq sauce. ��really bad. ��place was relati"
"Hands down my favorite Mexican place in the city. ��They have the best service I have ever had at a restaurant in the city, and their margaritas are amazing. ��The only slight complaint that I may have is that the Margaritas are a little pricey, but if you go on Tuesday or Thursday then they are half off."
"We have been going to Cara Mio for 5 or 6 years now, at least once or twice a month. ?Living only a few blocks away, it had always been a favorite. ?The last few times, however, things changed. ?The quality, friendly service that we always enjoyed has gone completely downhill. ?The level of food has been a bit spotty also, but given that we have always loved this place, we were willing to overlook these things as a minor speedbump. ?This changed last night when we phoned in a delivery order. ?The service was relatively quick, which was nice. ?When we opened our bags of food, however, we were stunned. ?Not only was it not what we ordered, the look and smell left a lot to be desired. ?We called the restaurant and told them that we were delivered someone elses order. ?We asked that they pick "
"1st the good. The guys(service) were good they were friendly but it seemed to me that as the night went on they were rocked, did see the shots flowing in the kitchen.The ambiance if you really want to call it that could have been better, I feel for the prices they charge they could have a better appearance. The music could be better not a big of rap so that doesn't help, but the volume was very annoying at times we couldn't hear each other and its a SMALL place. The food was good for the most part, they were a couple of items I could have skipped and few I could have more of. The Dr. Pepper thing didn't get it, guess it the chefs favorite thing, rice krispies treats really didn't hit the mark, I mean that something to do at home with the kids. The wife enjoyed it so I will do this like a c"
"Stay away! ��I started my Yelp account just so I could post this review. ��My boyfriend and I decided to try a new place in our neighborhood & were really hoping this would be a good choice for sushi in walking distance. ��It's always packed, so we had hope. ��The maitre d' was very nice & we had a drink in their lovely bar while we waited for a table. ��The servers were friendly and prompt. ��We were in a good mood, so we splurged on a $50 bottle of Moet. The nigiri was promising, but when we got to our rolls they were mushy and somewhat tasteless. ��The place does not know how to make rice! ��While we were underwhelmed by the food, we were still having a decent time, but it was completely ruined by some little Asian man in heavy-rimmed glasses approaching our table shortly after we paid. ��He ask"
"From the bartender Joe to our waiter Michael this establishment has brought back what a dining experience is suppose to be. ��They were the kindest most accomodating restaurant I've been to in the Chicago area in forever. ��All restaurants should model their customer service after them. ��Ruth's Chris made our 2nd anniversary one We will never forget. ��They even sent somebody to get me nose spray because i couldnt breathe well. ��I dont think there is another place that would do that. ��They didnt even charge us for literally taking a trip to a store to help me enjoy myself comfortably. ��in addition to all THAT......the food was spectacular, cooked to perfection and served in a timely fashion."
It's not Chicago deep dish but it's fricking good. ��The beer is awesome as well. ��Try and go during off hours as it gets pretty crowded. ��Cool to sit at the bar or grab a table with friends. ��Piece!
"Some of the best food in Chicago! Adorable restaurant and very friendly adorable staff. ��Went on a Sunday night and they had a small band (singer and guitarist) that just made the experience event better. ��The Romanian wine that was recommended was very good and complimented all the food perfectly. ��Had the sausage appetizer, the special chicken and the white chocolate cr��me for desert and i could not have been happier. ��At the end of the meal, the owner (who was very attentive and funny throughout the whole meal) came over to baptize us with a shot of Romanian liquor that he poured in our mouths. ��It was so much fun! I left feeling so happy that I was giddy, and it wasn't just from the liquor!"
"The owner of this place is pretty awesome and will sit down and talk with you. They have excellent food and their wait staff is on the ball. Some of the girls who work behind the bar are a bit snotty. Would give this place 5 stars on the food alone but due to the amount of meatheads and such that hang out at this place, its not somewhere I ever want to sit and eat at. Nine times out of ten I get my great food to go and always tip the waitresses that get it ready for me."
"What a lovely evening we had tonight! ��My husband and I went here for our anniversary and could not have been more pleased. ��We came into the restaurant to personalized menus for the occasion. ��Carlo seated us in a private candlelit room which was really romantic. ��Our waiter was knowledgeable and very attentive. ��The caprese salad was delish, but our entrees were to die for. ��I had the pumpkin ravioli and my husband had the pesto gnoci. ��The pumpkin ravioli hands down in the tastiest thing I have ordered out all year. ��We shared a bottle of wine and just enjoyed the experience. ��To top the evening off, our waiter gave us glasses of champange and dessert on the house. ��We will definitely be back."
I've been going here since they opened. ��I'm glad to see that they have been successful and I continue to be loyal. ��Although success doesn't always translate into better customer service - they require a credit card for reservations over 4 people and spend too much time telling you that you will be charged if you are a no-show. ��Hello? ��I came here once a week when you didn't even need a reservation because the restaurant was never full!! ��Sushi is still delicious and fresh. ��Must pick up Sake from Olivia's Market down the street.
"My first meal out in 2012 was not disappointing. ��I started it off with my ��first visit to Lockdown Bar & Grill. ��We were greeted by two friendly staff members as we entered. ��Miranda was our server, she was helpful in navigating the extensive beer menu and attentive throughout the meal. ��It was a Monday, the special was The Bone Collector, (wings). ��I am not a wing eater but someone else ordered them as an appetizer and they were meaty and delicious. ��I ordered the Guillotine ��(wedge) salad, it was average but expensive at $9. ��When is came to the main course I ordered the Arson Burger, it was huge, cooked to order and as the name indicated Hot as Hell. ��I loved it. ��The flavorful Mac & Cheese side could have been in a meal in itself. ��Because of the generous portions we left with about h"
Very good tacos! Im not sure why there is three locations steps away from each other but thats ok. Jarritos and carne asada tacos...delicious! The cilantro adds the best touch.
"The Chicago Diner has awesome breakfast. I love their scrambled tofu, french toast, biscuits and gravy, and pancakes. They give you a ton of food so I usually end up over eating when I come here. I do like their lunch but usually go earlier for breakfast. When I do go for lunch, I like their philly cheese steak and reuban sandwiches. They also have good vegan macaroni and cheese! And the best thing is the vegan peanut butter cookie dough milkshake."
"I celebrated my graduation dinner there and I'm glad I did.It was casual and not too pricey given the crowd size we had.Amazing food. That's really all I can say. I don't think anyone at my table (and it was a graduation party) was disappointed and my family can be really picky.The wait staff was really helpful and I like that even for a casual place they offered to take our coats.It seems like a great place to take a date because the restaurant is lively, but not too loud."
"Yummy pizza, better than most. I love the cheese & fresh garlic! My only problem is the customer service, the give free soda to one customer, but not the next (with similar order) and one time when I opened the box at home the pizza cheese was all pushed to one side, the other side was without cheese :( Overall, very yummy!"
"Best salad bar in the city! ��Service can be iffy. ��I have been on several occasions and if it weren't for the jello and the cream cheese chocolate chip mixture, I can honestly say the service might dissuade my return. ��I am also not a huge fan of the parking situation in the area, although there is valet."
"Be warned... The dishes meals here are oversized, lol. Not that it's a bad thing of course. I went in with my coworkers after a long day at work and ordered the lamb already not as hungry as my buddies. When it arrived, I was awestruck! Thankfully, my friend finished what I had left of it. The place is great and the staff was very friendly to our group! Long story short, I'm making plans to eat there this friday night!"
"I normally just come here for happy hours.I find the staff to be very nice and cordial. ��The servers have a personality...something you don't really see elsewhere.I like their outdoor patio as well, though it can loud from the train. Food is just fine. ��Not the best I've ever had, but that's not a concern. ��Overall, I really dig this place!"
"always a bit too busy, but this is an excellent neighborhood bar and restaurant. ��Locally grown food, and known for excellent mussels!"
"Hands down my favorite bar in Chicago. Coconut curry mussels and a forty great beers on tap...need I say more? It gets crowded on the weekends, but what good place doesn't. ��It's well worth wading through the crowds in my opinion. ��Their beer list is the best in the city and their bistro style food is second to none."
Best pizza in Chicago... end of story.
The best deep dish pizza in the world!
"This place lives up to the hype. ��I don't think any hot dog is worth a 2 hour wait, but I always go during non-peak hours.The duck fries are good but the hot dogs really steal the show. ��I love the spicy thai dog. ��I usually get 2 dogs and skip the fries.I have met some very nice people while waiting in line. ��It's really an experience at Doug's.Make sure you bring cash. ��Doug is very nice."
"Grand Lux is AMAZINGI've never been there for an actual meal, because it is somewhat pricey, but their desserts are fabulous. big portions make up for the big prices, and most of the desserts can be easily shared between two people, they are very heavy and rich. The decor of this place is beautiful, very classy. You can watch the chefs at work if you like, and that in itself is pretty nice. All in all it is a beautiful classy roomy place, yet it is somewhat comfortable too. They don't have a dress code so you can go in dressed up, or in jeans and a t-shirt (as several of my friends were when we went) If you go, make sure to request the round room, it looks right out over Michigan Avenue, very pretty and romantic. As far a recomendations, I got the apple crisp, which was fantastic, served w"
"The chubby short man at the door who takes peoples names is aggresively rude. I asked him how long the wait would be and he got mad and started yelling at me. Ever seen the soup nazi episode of Seinfeld? This guy is chicago's soup nazi. With all the great restaurants in chinatown, there is no reason to go to a place where the staff are deliberately rude to their guests."
"My girlfriend and I dined in on wednedsday the 17th, and it was our 1 year annuversary. Their foods are OUTSTANDING.. Service was outstanding as well, Peter was our waiter and he was very helpful with the selection of entree. ��For appetizer we had the ropa de vieja which was.. super delicious and also the halibut carpacio. ��WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK .. WE HAD A GOOD NIGHT.. :) RATED 10 stars.. OH VALET IS SO CHEAP its only $5 :)"
"Extremely loud, chaotically busy, and impossible to get a table. ��But it's all worth it because they make the best pizza in Chicago! ��A great place to go with a group of friends and get sloshed on good beer."
"Consistently fresh, healthy, delicious food with super-friendly service. ��If you live in Lincoln Park and you haven't paid this place a visit, you're missing out. ��Highlights include the shrimp tamarind soup (which is plenty big enough to share) and the dish with grilled beef, calamari, AND shrimp (served over noodles with a light sauce and a salad). ��Plentiful fresh, crispy bean sprouts and leafy cilantro come with lots of the plates here. ��The owner is extremely passionate about his food and making the place welcoming for diners or take-out customers. ��The complimentary seasonal fresh fruit doesn't hurt either."
"As soon as i took that first bite, i tasted full flavor of everything in ma Pizza. Best Deep dishhh evaaaa. Pizza fans MUST try this. only $4. This beats Giodanos, pizza hut etc"
"Pretty good food, but too large a menu. The atmosphere was too dark, and the bar area was a bit dirty. Reminded me of an old mobster's restaurant, so that may be good for some folks."
"Found Nana via OpenTable two days ago and they looked great. ��I placed the reservation and asked whether they could offer some kind of dessert with a candle for a delayed birthday celebration. ��Because that was an important aspect of my making the reservation, I placed a call to the restaurant to confirm the special request - the reservation was just a few hours later and I needed the new experience to be on-point. ��I was told that that the dessert deal could be done. Our Nana 1st-timer experience was very pleasant; great food. ��We had the fried green tomatoes (the tomatoes were a bit less cooked than we prefer and the popcorn sauce was a tad nondescript). The andouille sausage had a sassy 'kick' to it. The pork shoulder meal with poblano grits - awesome, Soft crab meal - great, Kids chick"
Took my Mom here for Mother's Day and had a great experience. Food and service is always top notch and has a very sharp staff. Definitely a memorable meal and day. My only issue is that the bill can really add up but that's life at the top!
"Beauuutiful patio! ��Inside and out, the place is well decorated and an intimate space to relax with a multiple course meal. ��The options are always changing and the creative selection uses great, fresh ingredients. ��I only wish it were more affordable to eat here often."
"Where do I start? First of all thinking if you go to china town for chinese food it should be good. Wrong. It was the worst chinese food i've ever had. The whole experience was horrible. We arrived for lunch around 2pm we were seated right away and then totally forgotten about . We watched people who had arrived after us being served.Finally I waved the waitress to come over and take our order. We decided to do a few apetizers first. All four were horrible ( overcooked,greasy, no flavor) we then decided to pass on the main course."
"My husband and I regularly attended Glenn's Diner on Montrose Ave. ?Not anymore. ?Not because of the food but because of the way we were treated. ?We had never been to crab night so we decided to go with a friend of ours. ?First we were not told on Crab night you cannot BYOB. ?OK, so order a bottle of wine and we get a glass. ?When we told the waitress we wanted a bottle she got the bottle but no more glasses. ?My friend and I ordered the crab special and my husband ordered fish because he cannot eat crab. ?When we all got our meals it looked good and my husband said I love coleslaw, can I have a bite ?Well of course, right, NOPE. ?The Crab Police were on patrol and we were told, very rudely, that no sharing was allow of anything. ?I get it, its all you can eat crab you don't want to lose "
"Janet has a great place here. I am new to Chicago and 3rd Coast was the brunch selection of a first date. Sunday brunch was a little hectic, but the owner got us seated in about 10 minutes. I can't say much more than what has already been said. It's not in my neighborhood, but worth the trip. I look forward to getting back soon."
"I did not like cake that much, but after my first birthday cake from Artopolis as Mango Yogurt/Mose. Wow, I buy cakes over there as snacks. So tasty!"
"I went here the other night because our originally planned destination Broadway Cellars was closed for a private event. Ridiculous trendy decor aside the food here was pretty ""meh"". I had the red curry (which I admit is a boring choice) which was like soupy water. Neither of my two friends were very impressed either.But the service was the real reason I am writing this review. I have never been so rushed at a restaurant in my life. We were asked constantly if we were done, even when it was clear we all had just begun to eat our food! ��Maybe next time it will be take out."
"Oh My Gosh! ��I've Found The Best............The best French Toast on earth. ��Brioche bread soaked in egg custard and cooked perfectly. ��Golden brown and crispy on the outside, creamy and custardy on the inside. ��No fancy complicated overly sweetened sauce, only maple syrup and butter. ��Old fashion French toast but every single bite is HEAVEN!!P/S: 5 stars rating based on the French Toast only."
"My lady and I went there the other night fro some drinks, and appetizers etc... It was a good experience, although I definitely went home a little sick from the greasy food.4-stars: 1 for service (friendly and attentive), 1 for amazing ambiance (very classy and diverse), 1 star for great beer on draft and tasty, and 1 because I enjoyed my experience. I would defiantly try their calamari ��(nicely plated), however -1 stars because their burgers were too greasy for me (and I split it with my date). ��Maybe it was just personal preference, but my date was as well. However Ill defiantly be coming back for another beer sometime or dessert, but I am not sure about dinner. Overall nice place."
"A BYOB with excellent food and great service--LOVE IT! ��I have dined in and ordered delivery from here on various occassions, and both experiences are always great. ��Their food is delicious and they have quite a variety of healthy options in generous portions which I love. ��When I order delivery, they even often throw in fresh fruit and free smoothies on occassion (nice touch). ��I am personally a big fan of the shrimp sate and lemongrass chicken, but everything I've ordered here has been tasty."
"This was by far the best restaurant I have EVER been to! All the meal courses were terrific, and service was outstanding. The prices were very high, but you get what you pay for. There is a wide selection of food to pick from, along with a wine list. Definitely worth all the money spent, and there was a lot of money spent."
"I love their pizza. I was worried when it was on Check Please that people would start going there and it would be too crowded. So far that hasn't happened.I always plan on trying something else, but the pizza is so good that I can't help but order it."
"Even if you have to wait for a table, you won't be dissapointed in dining at the Grand Lux. ��It has fantastic food and very reasonable prices. ��Skip the salad a order dessert. ��I highly recommend the New Orleans Beignets!"
Enjoyed the meal very much. ��Table was ready when we arrived. ��The service was very good and the food was delicious. ��Great value for the price
"My husband took me to Ruth Chris for my Bday last month and it was delicious. I had the sauteed shrimp and my husband had the filet mignon with potatoes and mushrooms. OMG!!!! I would def go back. the staff were polite and ��catered to our every needs. The valet parking attendant were quick, the host was nice and greeted us with Mr.& Mrs.thumbs up"
"THE CAST OF CHARACTERS: One father, one mother, one 3-year-old, one newbornTHE VENUE: Very classy marblemania Vegas style. Beats out the Tropicana Atlantic City buffet hands down. ��Parents take head--the place has enough ambient noise to drown out your kids, ensuring enough of a buffer for other diners. There's outdoor seating too, with heat lamps. A plus.THE WAIT SERVICE: Friendly, efficient and not overly solicitous. I give our waiter -1 for not presenting the option of a kids menu unsolicited.THE FOOD: I'm a pig so most food tastes good to me, but I give this joint ��a solid B+ for taste. ��We ordered:-Edamame for appetizer: perfectly cooked and not soggy like at most places; seasoned with some kind of soy sauce mix that gave it an interesting and yummy twist; pretty addictive, and even t"
"This hip micro-brewery and pizzeria had delicious pizza and beer! All around awesome location, although the wait was unnecessarily ��long for a thursday ..."
"Tasty food at a restaurant you're treated like royalty!My fiance and I went here on our 1-year anniversary three months ago and I swore I would eventually create a Yelp account just for this review! I'm still thinking about that meal. What ��a treat Graham Elliot was!!! From start to finish, impeccable. We were greeted warmly at the door and treated like VIP guests. The hostess escorted us to our table, where the busboy promptly served us water out of a special bottle -- very swanky -- and left it at the table. After we ordered, the server brought us a little black basket of hot popcorn drizzled in butter and garlic with a dash of salt. All very impressive in the first five minutes!I ordered the Cesar Salad on recommendation -- it came out with the Romaine leaves whole, covered in Parmesan "
Great food and fun atmosphere!!
"I LOVED XOCO! It was amazing! My friends and I were on a whirlwind trip to Chicago, there for 36 hours then go home, so we wanted to go to only the best places. Well we chose right! I went to xoco not knowing what i was going to get, so I ordered something that sounded interesting: Pork Belly Caldos, not knowing what caldos was. We went at about 3:30 and got to order right away and our food came out in 10 minutes. Our food came and i went oh it's soup semi disappointedly. Well that didn't last very long because it was AMAZING! It looked so beautiful, golden broth, fresh green arugula, toasted sesame seeds, fresh avocado, zucchini, mushrooms, tender vermicelli at the bottom, and of course pork belly. I didn't talk too much with my friends during that meal because i was eating this wonderful"
"Melted cheese, wine, chocolate, music, all ingredients for the perfect romantic setting. ��Best fondue in the city and perfect for date night. ��It's been around forever and the service is impeccable. Definitely fun for friends too, but ��an ideal ��place to wine and dine significant others on those special or just because occasions."
"I was really looking forward to having dinner at the Hopleaf since I have heard great things about their food but left feeling disappointed. ��For openers, we arrived before 6:00 and the dining room in the back had maybe 3 people in it. ��Knowing this, the ��hostess wanted to seat us behind a wall and facing a stairway and an emergency exit. ��Since the place empty I told the hostess to give us ��a better table. ��Duh? �� For an appetizer we ��started out sharing their signature Mussels Belgian style and they were excellent. ��For my entree ��I ordered Montreal brisket and it was extremely dried out and should not have been served in my opinion. ��Perhaps more disappointing was the Stliton cheese mac which not only didn't taste of Stilton, it didn't taste of anything because it was so under seasoned."
"I have been coming here religiously for the past 3-4 years or so, and never thought to write a review till tonight. Why you ask tonight of all nights made me want to do this, because I just came back from a H O R R I B I L E place and the 1st thing to came to mind after I walked out the front door was I should of went to Irazu.I will keep this short, Irazu has KILLER food at more than reasonable prices, great service, great delivery, etc... All the food is great, especially the Ceviche (best in the city by far) & their Steak sandwich. You get hungry, you go to Irazu, you get great service, eat killer food, are wowed by the cheap bill, and you go on with your day.If I could give this place 10 stars I would..."
"Over the Labour Day Weekend last year I was visiting Chicago and went to San Soo Gap San after a volleyball tournament. I recently moved to Chicago, and over THIS Labour Day Weekend my friends and I wanted to try out a different Korean BBQ joint after the tournament. I was looking up places within walking distance from my apartment and had completely forgotten where San Soo Gap San was, or even its name. So after walking two miles, fate would have it that we arrived at the crowded doorway of San Soo Gap San--again. But the second time around was just as good as the first time. The wait was long, but worthwhile, and the service got progressivly better throughout the night. I'm not going to comment too much on the food because it's simply good Korean food. It's not great--I've had better and"
"Does anyone know how to make the orgasmic cookies they have there?? Date or apricot, doesn't matter. Or even if you know what they're called that'd be a great help. Also, Sultan's awesome. Best mediterranean food on this side of the Atlantic, fo sho."
Grant always shows the best. His presentation and flavors with a flair like no other in Chicago.again a great meal.This is a great place to go consistantly.
I was here about a month ago or so. Their food was great. We ordered butter chicken and some other dishes. It was pricy.. I guess that's the downtown price.
"Down the street and always good.Breakfast sandwich is simple but amazing. Tried the stuffed french toast today and almost like a dessert! Really sweet with nuts, bananas, melted Brie!Must get is the bacon."
"My husband and I visited Geja's for our wedding anniversary. We'd always wanted to try fondue but never got around to it until then. I found the cafe on http://Restaurants.com and from the moment we walked in I was in love! The staff was excellent the place a was cozy, the wait staff was amazing that the food was a wonderful experience. The neighborhood added to the ambiance and it made for an enchanted evening. We plan to go back in a few weeks!"
"This place is fantastic. ��I was sad after La Pasteur closed, and when I saw the same owner opened Simply It I could wait to try it. ��Same great food, close to my house, and at very reasonable prices. ��Great food, and wonderful service. ��Definitely check it out."
"I've been going to Coast since 2008. ��It has some of the best sushi in chicago but somehow doesnt get as much hype as japonais, sunda, or sushi wabi. ��It's BYOB so that's a plus, although when they first opened, you could bring in whatever and however much you wanted. ��now, you can only bring in 1 bottle of wine or a 6pack of beer for every two people and they charge a corkage fee. ��the sushi rolls, sashimi, and nigiri are spectactular though. ��the service is just OK... a little slow. ��also, you can't make reservations, so i suggest walking in, putting your name down, and then running to the liquor store down the street and getting a bottle of wine. ��by the time you get back, a table should be available. �� another plus is they have fresh wasabi. �� yum! ��it's very affordable and i think it "
"My wife and I received the worst service we have ever experienced at any restaurant last night at Las Tablas. ��I seriously thought we were on candid camera and they were just trying to see how much we would take before we walked out or threw a glass at our waiter.We went to Las Tablas because we bought the groupon. ��We have been 3 or 4 times before and used to love this place at the old location and enjoyed the new location previously and had no issues and always loved the food.Last night started by a short wait, which was no surprise and just fine for a friday night. We sat at the bar. ��We sat there for 10-15 minutes and not once did the bartender ask if my wife or I would like a drink. ��I stared at the guy while he walked back and forth in front of us, washing glasses, serving a few othe"
"I love this joint all you can eat steak! I AM SOOOOOO IN!!!! the best places around, and if you go during lunch you save about 3 months worth of your pay. LOL Still a great place to eat."
"fine tacos , beer , chips, guacamole this is a good life"
"It's Saturday night and my friends and I are headed to Sunda for 8:30pm reservations that we made weeks in advance. ��Woohoo!! ��We all can't wait!! ��Our cabbie hits a little bit of traffic, so at 8:25pm I called the restaurant to notify them that we would be 5-10 minutes late. ��Nice thing to do, right? ��Wrong....when we arrive at 8:40pm, I learn that our table had been given away. ��So much for placing that curtosy call. ��The place is packed and no effort was made to reseat us. �� �� There obviously was a misunderstanding so I tried to remedy it by speaking with the GM, Aeron Lancero. ��The hostess Abby informs me that Aeron is not in, but that I could take a business card and call him. ��I call, and have called for several days now, but there is only one problem....Aeron doesn't have voicemail "
This is my favorite place to go in the neighborhood. ��It is perfect for chatting with friends over great beer and plump mussels and sandwiches. ��Very European feel... with no TVs.Great atmosphere. ��Try to sit upstairs if possible.
"The baked good in this store are OUTSTANDING. The bakery itself, meaning the staff, leaves MUCH to be desired. Every time I go there (and I live two blocks away, so I go often), it is like pulling teeth to get anyone in the bakery to even look at me, even when I am the only customer in sight. When I do get their attention, they are CLEARLY irritated at having to wait on me. It's a store, right? I mean, the items are behind glass. I cannot simply serve myself. Similarly, the bakery staff are also tasked with serving coffee. My experience tells me that you MUST go out of your way, no matter how obvious your presence, to beg them for coffee. You could stand there with a hatchet sticking out of your head and I doubt the employees would notice or care.Fox & Obel carries a number of specialty fo"
Food was great. Especially the kobe beef. It is expensive and a bit pretentious but the food was great. The tuna sashimi I had melted in my mouth. I would recommend reservations as it gets pretty crowded. Overall delicious!
"Luckily happened to walk up to stand in line at just the right time (thanks to not changing the watch from EST), and being able to sit at a 2-top table in the bar area, didn't have to wait too long, as this place is apparently always packed, and has a 8+ week reservation wait list for the dining room reservable tables. My friend had the Champagne Margarita, and I had the Blood Orange Margarita - both deliciously refreshing & just the right amount of alcohol. Started with Verduras Asadas, Tres Chiles appetizer, one of the best I've had, my friend seemed to agree.She had the Puerco en Clemole Castellano, which was the low point of the meal - rather bland compared to everything else we'd had. I had the Enchiladas de Pato al Pasilla, which was a unique combination of flavors, but it worked wel"
"GREAT PLACE TO TAKE out of towners visiting Chicago. Great decor, prices aren't too bad (10-11-12-13$ for a dinner entree). They will be impressed. Good service, very busy, excellent, REAL food you can tell they prepared in the kitchen. ��Very satisfying! I live in Chicago and sometimes go here during the week for late dinners around 9pm when it's not so crowded. ��Devil's chicken, Italian Market Sandwich, Carolina BBQ Pork Sandwich, Pot Roast I've all had and are excellent."
Lao Sze Chuan food is great but they are the worst when it comes to on-time delivery. ��4 out of the last 5 times Lao Sze Chuan has been over an hour late getting delivery food to us. ��Sometimes it's not even hot.
"Wife and I were the 2nd customers as they just opened this morning. �� First impression is very good. ��Quite daring to be opening an organic restaurant in Bridgeport but this place might fly if highly successful Chinese eclectic Han 202 is any indicator. ��A heck of a lot healthier than another supposedly Healthy restaurant in the neighborhood. ��Mushroom crepes were light and fluffy. ��Wife's fresh tasting veggie omelet was not too big, light and accompanied by the best hash browns we've had in a long time. �� Fresh squeezed OJ and rich coffee. ��We liked that they don't automatically give you a pile of toast. ��Can't wait to try hemp pancakes and other treats soon. ��A bit overstaffed but to be expected when you have no idea on initial popularity. ��Obviously a family related labor of love."
"This place is amazing and highly recommend.We wanted a night we could remember but not with the attitude. It was my fianc��s 30th B-Day, they guys don't care but others... We went on a Friday night, the crowd was diverse and lively. Our initial seats were in the main dining area, a two seat booth. This was to close to comfort to our neighbors and asked to be moved to the bar tables that looked over the main dining room; smartest decision ever made by this guy. We ordered some cocktails from an extremely friendly Indian waitress that complemented my fianc��. We ordered the chefs suggestions with wine pairing and the red carpet treatment never stopped.By the time of the final pairing we couldn't eat any more. Our wonderful waitress (I wish that I could remember her name) boxes everything with "
love cost!!! white dragon is the best.
"I had just moved into a downtown high rise and asked the front desk who would they recommend for a good pizza.? I called Giordano's on Rush street and ordered a medium pizza with Italian sausage toppings and mushrooms. I waited for almost an hour and a half famished, just to receive an Italian sausage sandwich and a cheese pizza. I was very dissapointed as I do not like either one and do not eat Itallian sausage sandwiches. I called and the manager assured me that he would give me a credit for my next pizza. I called tonight and at first was delighted to hear the operator say, yes we owe you a pizza. I suppose his boss snatched him off the phone as another voice came on saying we do not show youe credit in the system. This was the boldest face lie I had heard all day, I reminded him that t"
The greatest meal I've ever eaten in my entire life. ��A spiritual experience in the truest sense of the word--Michael Carlson is a madman genius.
"Two weeks ago my sister and I brought our mom in for dinner to celebrate her 65th birthday and the staff truly made it an exceptional evening. My standards are pretty high for customer service and every person we interacted with truly went above and beyond. The food was delicious (meat and salad bar were both AMAZING) and we left happy, no longer hungry (to say the least!) and with great memories for a special day. I highly recommend coming here! Thank you, Fogo de Chao!"
"I had a bad experience at their cafe about two weeks ago. My food took 45 minutes to arrive! I was there with a friend of mine and we ended up leaving and asking for our money back because we had somewhere else to be.Here is why I give them four stars though. I was there earlier this week on Monday. I didn't want to go back after my last experience, but my friend was in town after having moved away a year ago, and she really wanted to go back to F&O. I was reluctant, but I walked in and asked the manager at the desk if the cafe was open, and I said I was hesitant to go back because of the problem from before. He couldn't have been nicer! He walked me and my three girl friends back to the restaurant area and spoke to the girl at the register. He came back up to us and said he explained to t"

"Great beer and great food. Hopleaf is one of the best bars in Chicago hands down. I recently attend an event in their upstairs room and it was a cool extention to an already great place. If you have not been here yet, make a point to go."
"15 year patron of the original Uncommon Ground. ��Poor service at the original, worse here. ��Sad."
"Was there earlier today, and had a fantastic treat...Meli Cafe is changing their juice bar and featured a pomagranate smoothie which i loved and a ginger drink which was amazing.We aslo enjoyed a cactus omelet, which i have to say for a first time cactus eater was great..., had eggwhites at no charge...(what a deal)New pancakes are to die for....Can't wait for their new location to open up in a few weeks..."
"This is the best pan pizza in the city! The way they carmelize the cheese on the crust is awesome, they also do that on their beef sandwiches. I always get a large sausage, it is crumbled not the wheel. If you get the pizza delivered ask for extra sauce and the wings are really tasty. Enjoy!"
"This place continues to deliver! ��We've never had a bad experience here, we have been going here for over 2 years. ��Love the fact that it is BYOB. ��The chefs are focused on flavor, not presentation (not like Alinea). ��And the flavors really work well together (not like Graham Elliot). ��We consider it one of, if not the best restaurant in Chicago. ��You will spend a couple of hours savoring your courses, and don't worry, you won't leave hungry!"
"I've been to Nana's 3 times and have loved every bite. I can't wait to go back for dinner. Yes, it's a bit expensive, but worthwhile and you'd pay the same on the Northside. I love the decor, too."
"I heard this was the best Mexican food in Chicago. It is not. The food was not just mediocre, it was bad. I ordered the tampiquena and the enchilada de mole was filled with and topped with....a ton of cheddar cheese! What? It was disgusting, greasy and I was so disappointed. The salsas were not anything special, the meat was low quality, and the veggies were wilted. The guacamole tasted like it came out of a package. The beans were dry and bland. There was really nothing I liked about this place and I cannot believe all the hype surrounding it."
"Hands down best restaurant in town. Perfect follow-up to a Broadway show. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed. Not quite jeans and t-shirt, but otherwise quite relaxed. We are not traditionally beef eaters in our family. We had the Filet Mignon Medallions w/Shrimp. If we could eat at Kinzie everyday, we would be converts. The meet was so tender and delicious. The shrimp was fresh and succulent, and the red bell pepper risotto was excellent. We had cream puffs and butter rum cheesecake for dessert. We do not recommend the cream puffs (aka profiteroles), as they were made w/ice cream instead of sweet cream. However, the butter rum cheesecake was heavenly. Overall, the specialty martinis are fantastic, waitstaff is truly remarkable and attentive, and the food was so good that we could easily "
great food.. love their chicken salad!!
"Food was good what we actually received. Service was terrible , our server forgot the 3 appetizers we ordered and tried to put in the order after our main course came and we alerted her that appetizers were missing. We went on Monday May 30 and restaurant was only 20 -25 %^ full. What must it be like when it is full? Non apologetic stuck up staff. Much nicer Italian places every where else."
"A good dining experience soured by a ""mistake"" on the check! After a great meal, we were presented with the check which was off by $5......I ordered the Surf and Turf.....3 small shrimp and a skirt steak which is offered in the menu at $24.95. The bill came and the meal was priced at $29.95. We asked our waitress about the mistake and we were informed that $24.95 is the lowest that the meal ""could cost"" but that due to ""market conditions"", mine was priced higher. I reviewed the menu from front to back and there is absolutely no mention of ""market pricing or that the bill would be subject to inaccuracies and fluctuations at the management's discretion. While I've eaten here before and live a whopping block away, I will not return and I will no longer recommend them. Sorry 90 Miles, you had "
"I've been to the Bad Apple several times because it's within walking distance of my apartment. ��They have an extensive beer list, with lots of interesting microbrews. ��Their burgers and fries are generally quite tasty, and I like their homemade ketchup. ��I'm really upset that the delicious cumin burger that was on the menu this summer is no longer there. ��It was amazing and should be brought back pronto. ��I've also tried their fall salad, which was good but had too many candied walnuts relative to salad greens, making it a lot richer than I wanted. ��I know I'll continue to be a regular at the Bad Apple, but I don't know if it's worth going out of your way for. ��Also, I HATE the logo. ��It looks really unprofessional, like it was done with early 1990's Clip Art."
"Great beer list, and amazing pizza. ��I wish I had ordered a bloody mary, because the people next to us did, and they looked amazing. ��Typically a long wait, but we got there around 11am on a Sunday and beat the crowds."
"I stopped in for lunch with a coworker this week. I had this desire for Brazilian food, after having been to a new Brazilian style pizzeria called Fogo 2 Go last week. I have been to other Brazilian steakhouses, but not to this one yet.  �� I must say that this is now my favorite, but there is still one, Texas of Brazil, that I haven't tried yet...The service was excellent, and the food was awesome. I had this like Risoto Mushroom thing that was just out of this world. We didn't fill up to much on the salad bar, but did have some delicious parm cheese and light veggies. The steaks were awesome, and I luved the sausage and chicken. ��The best part was the $19 something price..We took a long,,long..long lunch, maybe almost 2 hours, just kicked back and enjoyed ourselves. Made my day a bit long"
Amazing each and every time i come visit. ��The food keeps on improving and new additions continue to be great. ��I love getting the Mini Burger Flight each week to try out the different burgers and the little ones are so easy to eat and enjoy. ��The mussels are awesome and my friend loves the salads and the Prison Shank. ��Best thing so I have had so far may be the Meatballs.I will continue to visit Lockdown and try to perfect my Build your Own Mac and Cheese.
"The city of the deep dish has plenty of opinions about who makes the best deep dish pie, but my money is on Pequod's. ��There is one special part of this deep dish pizza that sets it above the rest, that is the crunchy and yummy caramelized crust. ��It is funny that a crust would be the best part of the pizza, some people don't even like the crust. ��This is not the usual hunk of dough that makes the crust of most pizzas........ ��It is special, delicious and makes me all giddy inside just thinking about it.While the crust is the best part of the pizza, please do not discount its other quality attributes. ��It is piled high with fresh toppings and gooey cheese while the dough rises moist and delicious. ��The sauce is tangy but sweet and compliments the flavor of the cheese.Pequod's also has a gr"
"The worst. ��We didn't get to try the pizza. ��We ordered pizza for delivery & they said under an hour. ��90 minutes later, we called and they were so rude on the phone. ��I asked to speak the manager and they said no and then hung up on me. ��My husband called and he was able to talk to the manager - and the manager could have cared less. ��Rude."
"I'm about to serve up a little more whine than cheese on this review. The name of this place should be The PRICEY Purple Pig! I am a HUGE wine connoisseur and I was incredibly unimpressed with this place. I finally went on a late Sunday afternoon in early March on a date after wanting to go to this place since I moved here. When my date and I walked in, we were seated with a large group of people we didn't know which was a little awkward, but I thought Oh well, it's a wine bar...it should be fine. Anyway, the waiter asked what we'd like to drink. I was in the mood for a red wine, and my date didn't have a preference, so we went for one of the more moderately priced wines. We were perplexed on what type of cheeses to get, so I asked the waiter for some suggestions on what to order that what"
"Sure, this place has good food and beer, but the service is AWFUL! ��My family was there for a birthday celebration, and when my dad (we're talking nearly 70 yr old man) complained to the manager about their policy of not serving certain beers in pitchers (only served in glasses), the manager said they would no longer serve us anything! ��Kicked out by the manager for questioning a policy? ��Come on! ��Of course this was after we had already paid our nearly $250 bill."
I just had lunch with some friends at the Gino's on Superior. We sat at the bar and ordered their mozzerella sticks with marinara. Delish! i asked the bartender and he said that they were made in house to which I replied they tasted like it. We then ordered a deep dish spinach with garlic and asked if we could get the pepperoni on top cause it would come out crispy. I guess it's the bartenders favorite and well it should be it was awesome. ��I think it is now my favorite as well! I just have to say that I will be coming back no matter what my waistline says!!!
absolutely love this place! their peppercorn steak is yummy and they have a chocolate cookie that is soooo awesome. A little pricey but worth it is you want nice atmosphere and food.
"Came in here last night. We did not have a reservation and the place was getting busy. They were able to squeeze in our table, and were seated within 15 minutes. Great food, service was pretty good. All the foods were fresh tasting and it all came out on a timely manner considering how many people were there. We'll definitely come back again especially with the BYOB they allow us :)"
Amazing. Simply amazing.
"I have heard great hings. It is BYOB which can save people money but it is very expensive for Italian. I mean very like $25/ person for the feel of a strip mall feeling Italian place?? The food is really good. I enjoyed it the first time and as leftovers. I am torn over the place because it was good but also because I think it cost a ton for what we got and Nothside Italian!! I am not cheap but after seeing $100/ for 4 meals, no drinks or apps I was annoyed. I like atmosphere at restaurants and this place lacks but has good food. I love Sabatino's and would check it out too because it is so fun to eat there and the food is of the same caliber and priced better."
"Yuca- AMAZING, Congri- EXTRA AMAZING, Masitas de Puerco- More AMAZING, Empanadas de guava & cream cheese- MOST AMAZING, LECHON- TO DIE FOR, Everything about this place is good. food, staff, atmosphere, It is def. a must try if you havent already. Oh and might I add my awesome awesome waiter (Guy with the long hair) split our tab AFTER he charged it, most places would tell you ""No way""."
"Normally I would not take the time to write something ��like this, but being in Chicago for the past 12 years and seeing restaurants come and go I was blown away about how rude the hostess was when I called to make a reservaiton. ��Yes, I understand that you are new and may be busy but when ��I asked her ""how are you doing this evening?"" ��she responded ""we are fully commited."" ��Restaurant 101: �� Actually take sometime to listen to what your guests are asking. ��Really sad when customer service is thrown to the side and you have robots working for you that all you have to do is press the play button. ��Good luck surving in this economy with a start like this."
"Love that its BYOB and the decor is very hip. The most important part, the food....is very well executed, and very fresh and flavorful! ��This place gets busy and people are typically waiting so be prepared for a wait on the weekends."
"One of my favorite places for mexican!! Yes, you may stand in line for 45 minutes to order your food--it is worth it. Do it. Fun place to take family and friends visiting the city. Our trick--ask for a glass of wine while you wait in line. Makes the time fly by!"
"My friend and I have been regular customers at Calo's for a while. On a recent visit in March 2012, on a Sunday at approximately 3:00pm, we decided to stop by for drinks and dinner. We found parking, were seated at a booth by the bar. BTW, there were 3 people sitting at the bar, 2 in the booth behind us and ourselves, for a grand total of 7 people. I observed that there were 2 waitresses working with the napkins/ silverware in a table in the back.The busboy brought us our water and the delicious bread plate. We ate bread and drank water. 10 minutes go by, we eat more bread and more water. 15 minutes pass we ran out of bread and drank sips of water. After 20 minutes, we are out of bread and water and no one has come to take our order. Mind you, there are 7 people in the place. A third waitr"
"if you want greasy, this is your place.i cant believe how many people are raving about this restaurant. yes, it's inexpensive and it's packed, so people do love it, i just think that if you're hoping to get authentic mexican food that is wholesome and natural (ie, lots of veggies and not so deep fried -- which is what i was hoping for) then this isnt the restaurant that you should visit. in my opinion, it's just your typical, greasy mexican restaurant where you feel like your getting bigger with each bite."
I used to love this place but now since they remodeled and more white people go here. The service is bad. The waitresses are just rude and look at you like you dont have the money to spend there. Its just bad when your own race looks at you that way and treats you that way. This has happened to me more than 2 times. They have become over priced and they are becoming bland in flavor.
Surprisingly exciting and delicious for what is more or less a classier fast food place. Not uncommon to see Rick Bayless milling about. No real complaints other than the small size of the restaurant.
"Terrible customer service. ��I placed a large order for take-out; about $90. ��I ordered a certain salad and they sent me the wrong one. ��I tried calling back to ask them to correct it and kept getting a busy signal or put on hold for too long. ��I was having a party, hence the $90 order, and couldn't continue to call them back and hold. ��I called the next morning asking them to credit the $7.95 to me for my next order, since I do order quite often and they told me there was nothing they could do. ��I had to have called back right away to get the order corrected. ��When I told them I did do that, but couldn't get through, the girl said it didn't matter and there was nothing they could do. ��Some great customer service. ��Needless to say, I will never order from Calo again or eat in."
"First time visitors. ?The wait was very long for a Wed night, and it took forever to have a waiter show up. ?But, once ordered, the food was out super quick. ?Menu items were classics mixed with the very unusual - which you'd expect for a Chinese restaurant. The flavors were only OK. ?Kind of disappointing. ?The meats used seemed to be of good quality. ?So, for us, we will keep looking for our favorite' chinese restaurant."
"This place is just OK. I wanted to like it, I really did. I think the biggest problem was the attitude of the owner. He is very rude and is more interested in the drama between the wait staff then the experience of the guests. At least that is the way it was when we were there last week. The food was average not good enough to make me deal with the DRAMA."
"At a friend's suggestion, and after reading the reviews here, I couldn't wait to try Meli Cafe. ?I can't recall the last time I regretted going to a dining establishment as much. ?Let me preface this review with saying the food was decent. ?However, the HORRIBLY RUDE service overshadowed anything that could have made this morning's experience worth a return visit. ?After waiting 30 minutes to be seated, my friend and I were immediately asked by our waitress if we were ready to order. ?We asked for coffee but neither of us had even had a chance to open our menus yet. ?We asked for a few minutes. ?Our waitress came back within a minute. ?We were still looking over the menu and we asked for another few minutes. ?Within another minute, maybe three minutes total since we were initially seated, "
"I have been going here for at least 15 years. ��The food is authentic, consistent and excellent. ��There are only 2 negatives. Their service is what you'd expect from Korean establishments, not so great. ��They ��treat Korean adults (40+) differently than young adults, particularly favored towards men. ��When I go w/ my uncle and his family, we get many free refills on the banchan. When I go there with my friends, the free refills disappear and out comes a $1 charge per dish. ��Totally unfair, but true. 2nd negative is that the ventilation inside is very poor. ��I always leave w/ my clothes, skin and hair reaking of korean bbq. ��So, be prepared to be smelly afterwards."
"Tasty food. Nice ambience and decorIt just happened that we had the sweetest waitress ever. ?While she was quiet-spoken, she paid attention to us and the neighboring tables, All three pastas, the Cacio e Pepe, Paccheri con Salsiccia e Pomodori al forno and marrow ravioli special were cooked perfectly al dente like Rachel Ray says. ?Small sizes that are somehow suppose to be shared. ?We were not out until 9:30 pm! ?Nice evening."
"The food is absolutely delicious.We had early reservations and really enjoyed this spot.Fresh, inventive sushi, maki.The room is loud, the service, spotty, but it's worth it just to enjoy the food, the scene, and the trendy vibe."
"This place is great. Awesome beer at reasonable prices. Be careful, a lot of this beer is 7-9% so that will make a difference if you are in the mood to pound. The food here is terrific, and the wait is also reasonable in nearly all cases. If you like beer, this is the place to go in Chicago."
"This place is no longer the food-focused, quaint red and green steakhouse that was across the street. ��When we revisited this restaurant with some ex-Chicago residents, all of whom originally loved this place, we were surprised at the differences. ��Right when we arrived, the hostess told us Las Tablas is no longer BYOB for beer, so our beer had to be kept at their bar. ��She told us that you can BYO wine but, as others commented, there is a small corkage fee of $8. ��If they are trying dissuade BYO and boost their bar sales, they should get rid of that option entirely. ��However, some might like the option. ��Considering that the corkage fee would almost double the price of any wine I would bring, it might be better to get drinks from their bar. ��The hostess then charged us a $5 cover to get i"
This place is addicting. ��The sandwich that is made out of plantains instead of bread.The Best
"The thin crust pizza is delicious! This is a really fun lowkey place to grab some beer and pizza. It usually gets crowded so be prepared to wait for a while, although whenever I have that first bite of pizza I know the wait was worth it. I went to karaoke night here once as well and do agree that it was a lot of fun!"
"love it love it love it! great service! awsome envoirnment good prices! i can't get sick of it. if you can't find what you want to eat here, your tastebuds done broke."
"Anniversary of 13 years brought us to Piccolo Sogno. ��I wish I could figure out the mixed reviews, from five stars down to one! ��Is everyone's tastes and expectations that different? �� The one low score I had to laugh at was the review from a gal that complained that the seats outside were wet after a downpour. ��Like they should have controlled the weather better! ��Franco was our waiter who provided excellent service. ��One of the specials was a pasta with black truffles. ��I thought this might be too rich - since I am fond of truffles just as a garnish, so our waiter suggested having it split as an appetizer. Glad we did. ��I couldn't believe the fantastic flavor it possessed. �� Sea bass was excellent. ��Dessert plates had happy anniversary written in chocolate - nice touch. �� Only thing i ca"
"i used to LOVE Glens Diner until a particular experience. I went to celebrate my birthday here in February with my Mother and Father and was absolutely delicious! ( why we gave it three stars) We were paying our check when all of a sudden, one of the cooks spills barbeque sauce all over my mothers coat, shirt, and pants. It was my birthday, so my mom had her best clothes on. The cook along with Glen came to apologize and even asked to pick up the dry cleaning bill from my mom. We thought this was great! My mother went ahead and took her clothes to the dry cleaners and the bill came out to $75.00 because it was a heavy leather coat, her Ralph Lauren shirt and pants had to get a special treatment in order to take the barbeque sauce out of the pants. Well, we returned to Glens diner the follo"
"Sometime the fried stuffs were too dried, but I like the spicy food over there."
"The Quesdallas Raul are Bada Bing, Very Authentic menu & BYOB. I usaully ��roll 4 gallons of Sangria or a case of dos XX."
"First I would like to complement the prices, in this area you have the ability to make subpar food and charge premium prices, this is was not the case at Garcia's. It's a great Taco joint so don't expect fine dining here but the food is just straight out good! I had their tacos (Steak (don't expect prime cut meat here but the handle it perfectly, great example of doing the best with the least), Chicken (well seasoned could be dry at times), El Pastor (straight forward) and they have superior Langua tacos if you're into that) taste authentic and food comes out fast.NOW, on to the burrito.... GREAT size, they do not cheat you on anything here! Perfect burrito for a late night stop when you might have had too much to drink or you if you are just really hungry, on the western side you can orde"
"great wagyu ribeye, lobster mashed potatoes, butter cake. the truth- you could get the same quality at another steakhouse and get a much better service and overall experience. ��i asked for their best seat in the house when i made reservations and got a table next to the kitchen door. Also, i dont understand the big claim that this is a vegas style supper club type resto. ��the look and ambience is pretty much like any other fine dining resto in chicago. only thing diffrerent is the piano at the bar. ��so what? the live piano music is not even in the dining room for guests to enjoy. �� ��i ��live and dine in the city on a regular basis ( about 3 times a week in fancy restos) ��and this is no different from mortons, or gibsons, or even chicago cut steakhouse. good but not exceptional."
"Great food, HORRIBLE SERVICE. It's pretty much the worst restaurant service I've ever experienced. I did realize that when it comes to Chinatown restaurants, service is usually not that excellent to begin with, but my experience was that bad...I went with a party of 14 and the following things happened: the first dish came out by itself (and nothing else came out for a good 10 minutes), no rice until we flagged the server multiple times, the last dish came out after everything else was finished, and I had to go up to the register to get the check after waiting for 10+ minutes. I mean, seriously???I have been to Lao Sichuan before and the service was acceptable, but I got a table downstairs then. I heard that the service upstairs is horrible, and apparently it's not just a rumor. If you're "
Nice atmosphere. ��Great tuna.
"Okay, first off, I do not know how this place doesn't have five stars. People saying the portions were too small.. it's TAPAS. Know your food. And the price was well worth it for the flavors.. okay, now to my review:Yesterday my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place because we needed something to eat while we waited for someone in the JPMorgan Chase Corporate Challenge to be done. We were trying to choose between tapas and sushi, and boy am I so glad we chose tapas. When we entered, after walking up the stairs, we were astounded with the interior of the restaurant. With it's high ceilings, unique lighting and modern decor, I was already happy with our choice.As for what we ordered, the only thing I wasn't 100% happy with was the Red Sangria, mainly because I figured it would be sweet li"
"This Pizza is perfect for a change of pace. Need a break from the Chicago cracker now and again, decor is great and they make you feel as if your in there home. crust is good by itself without the fresh toppings."
"Excellent food, comfortable atmosphere, friendly & unpretentious wait staff. ��Did I mention excellent food? ��Everything ordered was delicious to the last bite. ��The small plates didn't fill us up and the waiter was really good about checking back to see how we were doing and if we wanted more selections. ��No reservation - we walked in at 5:15 and had a seat (I'm sure the wait is longer as it gets closer to the trendy dinner hour). ��In contrast, the Girl and the Goat required a three week reservation, we weren't seated until we were all there (one person stuck in traffic), we were rushed by the wait staff and had a fairly miserable experience."
"After receiving a personal invitation to dine at Zed 451 I thought I would give the concept a try. I was very impressed by the edginess of the atmosphere. From the floor to ceiling it was amazing. The "" Harvest Table"" was full of fun and delicious options. If you decide to give this restaurant a try I recommend to pay the price discounted from $50 and only have the buffet. The chefs drop by with different low end cuts of meat. Paying what I would pay to enjoy a filet of beef or have quality seafood at any other restaurant in Chicago i was disappointed. I can get chicken legs and salmon at fast food restaurants. If your dining for quantity and not quality this is your place. At the end of meal I thought the only thing that would bring me back is the atmosphere and the service. Then I change"
"Will frequent often for the drinks and the atmosphere. Other reviews speak for this place sufficiently, no need for me to elaborate any further."
"I work in the neighborhood and noticed this place had just opened. For Ukrainian Village it is definitely different. Most of the bars close by are dives with low grade bar food. This place has a hard rock/prison theme ��to it, and it looks like they put a ton of time and effort to make it look the part.The beer list is huge. They have a great selection. I also tried one of their burgers (it had prosciutto and apple slices,very unusual). This thing was ��huge, juicy, messy, and great. They also have wall to wall plasma screens playing a live concert. There was a schedule with that shows are on what days so I think I'll be back to watch Peal Jam and try another burger.This is a great addition to the neighborhood."
This place had amazing fresh Sushi and The Dragon roll was great! BYOB which you can go wrong with! The sushi was great! The only thing about it was that it is extremely packed so we had to wait for a while-- one great thing ABOUT the wait was that they were willing to take down you phone # so hey can call you if you left! I would definitely go there again! We didn't have to pay a lot too and we can out STUFFED! Try it out you wont be disappointed GREAT location too!
Great Place!!Love the atmosphere & food is outstanding.
"I've been to Sapori Trattoria three times total, and twice in the past two months. Overall, I think it's a great spot. I love the atmosphere. It's a great restaurant because it feels like you are eating at an old school independent restaurant. They have an awesome wine list and I have never had a bad experience there. It's nice that the restaurant is always full and lively but not too loud. My boyfriend had the pumpkin ravioli once and thought it was delicious. I enjoyed the gnocchi but ordered with a spicy marinara sauce that was DELICIOUS. The portion was HUGE and the two of us shared leftovers after being out on New Years Eve late night.They also send you a $15.00 gift card for your birthday... that's always nice! :)"
"My husband and I were honored to be invited to preview Sunda before it opened to the public during their ""tasting"" weekend. ��The decor is elegant and luxe upscale yet inviting and the food is truly exceptional. ��They had amazing vegetarian options as well. It was a culinary treat and the environment was beautiful. If you like sushi, the caterpillar roll and the ""number 10"" are outstanding. ��Highly recommend!"
"Good food. Great location. Very long beer and drink list. Our food was good, but my daughter's Mac and Cheese off the kids menu was incredible... and so huge! It would have been enough for adults to share, much less feed a toddler."

"My husband and I went to Sunda for the weekday happy hour special. ��It was awesome. ��We had the mai-tai's which were the drink special. ��We also had corn fritters, shrimp tempura and sushi. ��It was all great. ��Will definitely go back. ��We went right at 5 so it wasn't very loud."
"Soggy Soggy Soggy Dough! ��Wet in the center and the crust is pretty much identical consistency to something like Dominoes. ��The fresh bufalo is nice and i had nice panna cotta, but in my opinion the pizza is worthless."
Chicago Diner has been a mainstay for vegetarianism since 1983. If that aint hardcore i dunno what is. Their menu is now mostly vegan which is a nice switch from a few years ago. They are huge supporters of the community and Chef Jo cranks out the yum. They still serve eggs and dairy particularly on their breakfast menu.
"I used to love this place, they had such great pizza. ��Just like Jeff G. mentioned this place is over- rated. ��Unlike many reviewers, I live in the area. ��I ordered pizza from this place since 2004. ��The quality of this restaurant has been declining steadily. ��I'm not sure if people have lowered their standards of good food but believe me when I tell you that they do not serve good food in this restaurant. ��Their pizza has gone from great to mediocre (when ur drunk). I also had the opportunity to visit the dining room. ��The experience was unforgettable.... as in I'm never going there again. ��I invited my family to this restaurant. Waitstaff was rude,it took them about 45 minutes to take my order and the dining room was empty, waitstaff was clueless, and the food arrived cold and tasteless."
Went here last night and got some bacon role dish. Best sushi I've ever had in the city!
"I'm amazed that so many people raved about this place. ��My sis and I went for breakfast one day. We were seated right away, waited 10 minutes for coffee. We both had 1 egg and sausage. The eggs,scrambled, were slightly burned and almost cold. The sausage was the size of a half dollar and no thicker. It was totally tasteless. I ordered toast (ala carte) it was cold no butter was on the table, when I asked for some it was ice cold. I then asked for some jam for the toast, they only serve what is in season so all they had was apple butter, YUCK!The price for this totally forgettable meal was $21.00. Ramova grill here I come."
"If you love seafood, then you need to check out the Baltimore Pizza they make with lump crab....They ad a fish seasoning, called Old Bay, which is great on shrimp and crab. ��This is now my favorite pizza from my new favorite pizza parlor..Like the Shrimp Scampi as well(nice fresh garlic taste in the wine sauce).. Gotta try them out..I did the 2 pizza deal, one was 50% off, and had 'em delivered this week...I might be hungry, but this cold Chicago weather is killing me.PS..Can you deliver beer?"
"Super yummy vegan food options - biscuits and gravy hooray! It can be hard to finding comfort style foods that are meat and dairy free and they have done a great job. Often vegan items are whole wheat and prune juice sweetened lumps of mush and you just want something like everyone else gets and they have a great range of vegan options on the menu- inc deserts! Plus my non veagn friend could eat there too. Quick, comfortable and affordable"
"Heard good stuff about this place, but NOTHING SPECIAL! ��I wouldn't not go back if I had to, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way for a meal here."
"This bakery does not live up to the hype. We payed a pretty penny for our sons birthday cake and found their decorating skills to be below average, I give them credit for trying to resolve our issue with the design but their second attempt was a disaster as well. Definitely not worth the money."
"This local gastropub is right on. It has the early 1900's roadhouse feel with it's pushbutton jukebox and its cloth-on-a-roll bathroom towels. I don't know why but all the waiters have moustache, which I imagine is an amalgamation of the logan square hip kids and the turn of the last century stylings which is exemplified by the old-timey photo-wallpaper in the bathroom. This place is an obvious improvement to the long defunct Winds Cafe... and not just vis-a-vis their inclusion of a bed and breakfast (due up in the spring).Food. I had the creamy scallop bisque and my friend had the wild boar sloppy joe. Not a lot of bisque, but plenty of joe to the point that I had about 1/2 of hers. Definitely tasty. Random trivia, the goal of all the dishes are to be comfort food that you would readily s"
"I've been to this place a few times with my boyfriend who is Belgian, and it has, according to him, one of the best selections of Belgian beers in the city. ��The food has also been great everytime I've been there. ��Not sure how the weekends are because it's usually a weeknight when I've been there."
"Was ok - not as great as all of the review I read. ��Pork shoulder was tasty, but the rest was mediocre."
"I hate to do this, but it truly is worth only one star. The place is not clean to start. The service is too busy gossiping and playing with each other than serving the patrons. We then got our food, it was okay but not worth the rest of the experience. The owner then came out to ask if everything was OK and we explain our experience with the wait staff and he gave us more attitude then the waiter himself. ��If you don't want the truth DON'T ASK!"
"We loved, loved, loved dining here and especially the ambiance. ��Our waitress was very knowledgeable and the food was very tasty."
"We ate at NANA last night to celebrate our anniversary. ��Our daughter and her friend joined us. ��Let me tell you, we had one of the best dinners we have ever experienced. ��The place has a great feel to it, warm and comfortable, but hip at the same time with exposed brick, great lighting and nice art.We began with the amazing antipasto that had the tastiest morsels of stuff we couldn't identify, but made our taste buds jump for joy! ��We also ordered these little brisket things that were killer! ��Our daughter ordered the pork shoulder, her friend the Hanger Steak, my wife the scallops and brisket, and I had the quail. ��OMG!!! I nibbled that little guy till almost nothing was left. ��Amazing!! ��Everyone kept raving about their dish throughout the meal. ��We then made it to the desert assortment"
"Love love love their Roasted Corn salad and their Torta Bacio (chocolate desert). The only reason for a 4-star rating instead of a 5 is that the chefs refrain from making substitutions, which is a little bit odd for the price point."
"It's a carnivore's paradise. It's like an alcoholic walking into a liquor store. The restaurant is huge, which is good in the sense that if you're stuck waiting the turnover is fairly quick. I've always made reservations in advance, typically for a Friday or Saturday night. It's usually packed when I go. I believe you have two options: salad bar only or salad bar plus meat. Now, the salad bar is a quagmire. You can easily make a full meal out of the bounty offered. There's asparagus, sliced tomatoes, fresh parmigiana, smoked salmon and all kinds of other goodies. I love their salad bar but I deliberately try to get away from it with a small plate lest I ruin my appetite for the carnage that awaits. You get this thing that looks like a paper coaster. It's green on one side and red on the fl"
"Decent food, not great. ��They don't quite understand the meaning of making it as spicy as you can. ��Their drunken noodles were not that great. ��Spicy basil leaf was good but tooo dry. ��However, I would still return for their panang curry."
"Great Restaurant, Great Price, Great Food. ��Try the Chicken Vesuvio delivered.. Incredible and mouth watering!!!!!"
Really like it here. ��Of course for the right occasion. ��Not the type of place to go to if you want to let your hair down though. ��Classy place to have a classic cocktail.
Great atmosphere and vibe. The bartenders are tatted up and sexy. This place gets pretty packed on good nights.I'm a snob for good beer and the selection here is spot on. The prices are a bit much for Logan Square though.
"I just joined Yelp this morning for the sole purpose of writing a review about Sunda and what a terrible experience I had there recently. 6 of us wanted to go there to enjoy drinks/dinner and were asked to leave, not in a nice way but in the rudest way ever by the most obnoxious waitress. Apparantly you can only get a table in the bar area if you are an ""investor"".Even if you are joining another party who has already spent $400 at that table, they weill tell you to leave. We probably also would have had a tab of several hundred dollars, instead we spent 0, left, will never return and will make sure none of our friends return either. I have been to restaurants all over the world and have NEVER been treated so poorly! This server should be fired! Telling nice, good paying customers to leave "
I do not recommend!The portions are smaller than usual and overpriced.
"To be fair, we cannot comment on the food, because we never got this far. ?Front staff and experience trying to visit was very disappointing. ?Stopped in on a Saturday (looking ahead online to see that they do NOT take reservations). ?The person ahead of us was told that his wait would be 45 minutes. ?We were told that our party of 3 would be a at least and hour and a half (and that they do take limited reservations, unlike the online profile). ?We left a phone number to be called if we left the building, then made the decision that an hour and a half was too long (considering the many empty tables we saw) and left catching a cab back to our parking garage. 12 minutes later, yes 12 minutes later we were called. ?No I could not answer it on the first ring because I was in a parking garage w"
Have been going there for last three years and have nothing to complain about. Food is delicious and staff is very friendly!I would highly recommend them.Their potato salad is to die for:)
"Um...they forgot to deliver my wedding cake. I picked out a delicious cupcake tier and groom's cake and they completely forgot to bring them to my wedding venue. My father had to call the bakery during dinner and thankfully he got a hold of someone who rushed them over. This is all very bad but I really do like cake and was a pretty laid back bride so if the post-debacle follow through had been better I might still find it within me to acknowledge that mistakes do happen and the cupcakes are, after all, pretty god damn tasty. But the personal touch and apology just was not there. Sure, my contact at the bakery apologized but only because we dragged it out of him and I just don't feel like they really cared or felt that bad their mistake. In the end, I still love the cupcakes but am hesitan"
"Great Service for starters, the food is very traditional and tasty. ��I had the branzino fish which was expertly cooked and the greek salad was very fresh and delicious."
Great food though pricey!
"Let me start by saying that the service here is incredible! Definitely what I consider a BBQ Game Changer. I went there for the first time with my friend Becca and some of her girlfriends and was absolutely blown away. According to my buddies, you even get a special treat on you birthday. This was a new idea to me and ended up loving it. The fries and sandwich are served all together bunched up and yummy in my tummy. So the fries end up being covered in the wonderful sauces and grease which dominate the sandwich. Seriously this place is truly as good as it gets within Chicago's BBQ scene. My mouth is watering just thinking about going here again. Thank you for the Chips & Pickles!"
"I live in the neighborhood and have been a regular customer ever since Simply It opened...I've been there twice already this week! ��I'm addicted to the Lemongrass Chicken dish, but also love the Basil and Jalapeno Beef entree, so delicious. ��The Owner is always there and up front to greet you when you walk in, and the service is fantastic. ��The lunch special is an awesome deal - around $9 for soup, salad, egg roll, entree, and fruit (which is included after every meal there for free). ��I also love that it is BYOB. ��I cannot recommend this restaurant to enough people, you have to try it to understand how great it is!"
"My great-grandma lived right around the corner at Milwaukee and Devon, so I grew up eating here. ��As soon as I got my drivers license, this was one of the first road trips I made! ��I LOVE THIS PLACE! ��My grandma grew up eating here, too. ��This is a historical landmark and the best dogs, burgers, & malts in the WORLD! ��I was in the hospital not that long ago & my mom actually drove all the way out there to pick me up a dog as a surprise treat. ��This place not only has its own amazing history, but our own family history. ��You gotta try this place!!! ��It will turn into a special family treat for you, too."
"The pizza at Piece is extremely generic. Kind of seems like something I could make with grocery store pizza dough, a jar of store bought marinara, and a bag of shredded motz. Not sure what people's pizza standards are, but this is nothing special.If you like thin crust, I would recommend Lou Malnati's thin crust. If you like beer, I would recommend the map room or Revolution brewery in Logan Sq.I am baffled by all the stellar reviews for such mediocre pizza."
Hands down the best Chicago style pizza around!! The pizza sauce is so perfectly seasoned it makes you want to ask for extra so you can smother your slice with it - Yes I am guilty of always asking for extra sauce. ��As for the dough - Finally!! You can eat a Chicago style pizza without feeling like you are eating a loaf of bread!! Highly Highly recommend.This review would get five stars if it weren't for their lack of service.
"The duck here is absolutely delicious! This is the only place my family comes to for duck. My dad started bringing me here and introduced me and my friends to it. It's really great, whether you're dining in and getting the Peking duck dinner, or you're getting some duck or roast pork to go. It's just amazing overall. This neighborhood is known for having great restaurants, and Sun Wah is definitely one of those. Great to bring friends to, the Peking duck dinner is enough to feed around 2-6 people, depending on how much everyone eats."
"I don't know if everyone else is crazy or if we went on an off night but of the 8 courses we experienced, we walked away not liking any of them! I was devastated to pay 200dollars(tip included) and not enjoy the meal at all. With small portions and the high price, every taste should have been amazing. Dishes were over salted and the focus is not the actual flavors. To spend that amount on a meal I would have expected some atmosphere. The place is in a U shape so the majority of tables are in a hallway and my boyfriend looked cramped sitting in between two walls. I loved the concept of a meal spread out with little dishes. We saved the visit for our anniversary. When I asked my partner why he was eating a dish when we both thought it tasted bad he replied cause I'm starving. I wanted to lov"
"This spot near Sox park really hits a home run with their food.I completely understand some of the skepticism people have about this new breakfast / lunch spot in the heart of Bridgeport, I really do. However I think some people are too quick to judge and dismiss it.I just dined at Nana for the SECOND time this weekend. Me and my wife came to Nana the first time on a busy weekend for brunch right after they had first opened and had the experience of waiting quite a while for a table and for our food.*****IMPORTANT TO NOTE*****Being in the service industry myself I understand the inner workings of a restaurant and one thing I must point out is that when we were there I observed that the Micros? (computerized order system that sends the customer orders to the kitchen) was completely not func"
"I don't think I will ever go back! ��I have been a long time customer and wanted to stop by to check out the new location Saturday night. ��It was a disaster from the moment I walked into the door!The restauarant is much larger, but lacks service and wait staff. ��Why would you open a larger restaurant and not be prepared? ��It took us forever to order our food. ��We were there for almost 3 hours. ��The food was very salty. ��No one offered any apology for the long wait. ��I hope they get their act together sooner than later. ��Good luck if you still want to check it out!"
"we recently used cafe 28 to cater our wedding in the south loop. ��cafe 28 is our favorite restaurant in chicago so we thought what better food could we have for our wedding? ��it turned out amazing! ��we had heavy appetizers instead of a formal dinner with the food being passed as well as stationary and it was delicious! ��We weren't sure how are guests would like not having a full dinner but everyone raved about the food, and we had the largest bowl of guacamole i've ever seen! ��cafe 28 was great to work with and they walked us through tasting the menu, helped us decide how to present and serve the food, and even rented us equipment. �� delicious!"
Really kick ass place! ��It is got to be one of the most historically interesting places in Chicago. ��The people that used to frequent this place and the fact that they have tried to keep the historical ambiance is very exciting!
"I have several vegan friends and sometimes vegan + gluten free is difficult to come by. Not so at The Chicago Diner! ��They have a great gluten free menu with tons of choices. My tried and true meal is always the Tofu Stir Fry with Braggs. It is so so so good. The gluten free desserts are not quite my faves, but the main course is so filling you won't be left hungry, I promise."
Churros rock!!! Great casual place with real tasty mexican street food.
"I had been wanting to try Zed451 for several months and finally got the opportunity when my company placed them on its short list for our holiday party and future company events, and I was in charge of the ""food sampling."" Not only was the food outstanding but the service was excellent and the venue is perfect for just about any size group. One of my biggest concerns was whether or not the ""all you can eat"" style of menu could accommodate all of our employees; between the summer harvest table (soups, salads, cheese and bread) and the 12 delicious meat/seafood options, I think everyone is covered! The portions were the perfect size and allowed me to try each and every option, which was a plus in comparison to other restaurants of this style that I have tried in the past. Whether its for our"
"It was SO GOOD! ��I did have to wait out in the rain to get in for a reservation, but it was worth it. ��I could have licked the plate, it was so good! ��We had champagne margaritas (it was a good combination, I promise) a starter, mains, and dessert. ��Our waitress was fantastic and Jimmy Kimmel (no joke) was seated within chip throwing distance. ��It was a little pricey, but worth it for a great food splurge. ��I'll be back as soon as my piggy bank recovers!"
"It is expensive, it can get crowded, and the selection may seem limited to the very best foods. This is the place to get your Beluga caviar, your rare and blended teas, your Korean pears, your exotic pies and breads. The selection may seem overwhelming at first, but they really only stock a few of the finer brands. They excel at offering the best cheeses, meats, produce and bakery items."
"I've only come for dessert, baklava to be precise. ��But it was delicious and the atmosphere is fun. ��I recommend sitting by the window. ��We also got greek coffee which was pretty good but the grinds were so sludgy at the bottom that it wasn't good for telling fortunes. ��The wait staff is nice but a tad slow. ��Their pizza looks good though, maybe I will try it sometime. ��Being in greek town, they also have greek liquor for sale. ��I will come back in the summer to try their raqi."
"This is our FAVORITE Mexican place ever and it's located around the corner from us!!!! It has the best margaritas and salsa!!! ��If you haven't tried the Jamacian Flower, give it a try. ��It is excellent! ��Their food is the best.....although I think their fajita's are worst item on the menu. ��I really can't recommend this place enough. ��I don't think it gets the credit and recognition is deserves! ��And it deserves a lot!"
"One of the best omelets I ever had, and the potato pancake was to-die-for. ��However, I must add that the waiter, Brad, wasn't the most pleasant person to deal with and had an attitude. ��I had to keep asking him for coffee refills (only had 3 cups), and for a breakfast joint, this is not a good thing. ��I was speaking with another person about the diner, and they said the same thing that the service wasn't good."
"I have eaten here dozens of times, and had them deliver to two parties of mine. ��Their home-brewed beers are second to none, you can expect to drink some of the best beer around on each visit. ��Atmosphere is amazing, and it is not only a great place for sports but also children can go there in the afternoons and early evening. ��Some of the best thin crust pizza in Chicago, and I grew up on NY style. ��We have yet to find better pizza in Chicago and have eaten at so many popular places. ��The real test was ordering 15 pizzas for a party full of New Englanders, and that passed with flying colors!!"
I would say Art of Pizza is right up there with Giordano's as the best pizza in the city. My friends and I ordered 3 pizzas between 8 of us and barely finished off two. You definitely get your money's worth with the large pizzas. Also check our their lunch/dinner specials because they are definitely a good deal. I would suggest the Wednesday chicken parmigiana.
Beer and Pizza how can you go wrong? ��Lovely time out with the friends. ��Bringing some home for the hubby and kids.
Best damn omelettes I've had. ��This place is consistent with how good it is and that is very refreshing. ��Everything that comes out of that kitchen is fresh and tasty. ��I've hit up breakfast and lunch here and will keep on going back time and time again.
"I was looking for a place to have my family for mothers day, and my daughters christening (a 2 in 1). I talk to Omar for the first time 4-23 and he said he can accommodate my party of 35. He needed to talk to the chef about the menu and I called after the weekend, like he told me to (4-26) He still didn't have the menu together, he said his chef left already and if he could call me back the next day, well that was fine (kind of). So I called him (4-27) cause the event was not that far away. Omar asked if I wanted the whole room or just half of the room I again reminded him what the event was for and how half of the room was fine so he could still do business being mothers day and all. I still didn't receive a menu but told him I don't mind spending $25-30 per person (even after he told me "
Best Vegan food ever.
"so fun inside, or funny? interesting mix of modern minimalism, walks a fine line by beetleguese mansion! The drink I enjoyed was excellent, but I had not tried the other fair. ��Love no smoke no cell policy; its fun to smoke outside. Unfortunately the doorman needs some tips bout his job, at least it looks good intent and purpose. Both bartenders and waitresses make an excellent cocktail. May see a line of ugly people outside, but maybe thats just wicker park? I bet they all eventually are served, but why? Missed the back room on a weak weekday night, however, the mystery makes it even better. Is there a stage back there? do they grow wormwood?"
"Aside from the exclusive and pretentious nature of the place, I absolutely love my experiences here. Never attempt to get in with an odd number of people. It's perfect for dates--very intimate, perfectly dim lighting, tall drapes everywhere, no windows, tall cozy chairs. The drinks are all deliciously prepared with the finest liquors and homemade mixers. I was unimpressed by the selections of cheeses, so I've only had the beer nuts to eat here, but they were excellent. All in all, a great place to cocktail."
"My favorite place to grab a bite, a drink and relax. I have been going here for years and it just keeps getting better and better. The atmosphere is great and the workers are friendly and very pleasant. The manager here is quite nice and makes sure you have a good time and meal.My favorites are the baked clams, the garlic mashed potatoes and the thin crust pizza. I also love the grilled chicken mediterranean salad. Thanks Calo!"
Hands down the absolute best pizza I have ever tasted! ��It will be very hard for me to come back home to Miami! ��I guess my next vacation will be @ Fogo 2 Go!!
"Probably one of the best meals I have ever had in Chicago. The food was small plate and inventive. Why only 3 stars out 5? Read on and I'll explain. The pork braised milk shoulder was divine. So rich it melted in your mouth. Salted beets with goat cheese were a bit too salty for my taste, but hey thats me. Wine list was approachable and expansive enough that it covered even obscure regions. Service was prompt yet not over bearing. Server (Gina) was always available when needed yet not trying to shove courses down your throat to push the check. It's nice to be served by somebody so adorable and sweet. My issue came when I noticed one of the members of the management team adjusting themselves constantly, basically right in front of our table. You know a male member (dual meaning). Absolutely"
"I was expecting Chicago style pizza, but it was thin like NY pizza. Still a fan of the beer and food."
"Loved it. We went there for breakfast on a tuesday morning. We got there at around 8.30 and the place only had about 10-15 customers. Service was fast and the food was absolutely delicious. We got 2 chocolate espresso (it wakes you up right away), 1 agua de Jamaica (refreshing), 1 huevos rancheros, 1 egg chorizo torta and 3 churros with chocolate sauce (the chocolate sauce is to die for). A very satisfying meal, bold favors, very refreshing sauces, roasted tomatillo for the torta and roasted tomatoes on the huevos rancheros. All this experience for only around $30. I can't wait to go back to Chicago and try some more items on their menu. We will probably eat at this restaurant every time we will visit Chicago."
my friend sarah took me to sushi x because she raves about their vegetable maki how huge it is and the prices aren't even that high for the portion size. i actually i ate what is called i believe the godzilla roll it was amazing seriously you have to try it it is UNBELIEVABLE i drool thinking about it ....it just hits the spot GO GO GO and at least taste what i am talking about .
I think the place is going down. I have been going here for years but I stopped because of sanitary reasons and they always mess up take out orders. I never get what I order for take outs. The cooks put in whatever they want regardless what is says on the order ticket. ��I don't know how they passed the health inspection back in February with bugs around maybe they know people . I still see them taking out the trash/garbage through the front door which is a health code no no.
"I had rattle snake here! And it didn't kill me! If you haven't already been, just go check it out already, you won't be disappointed (even in February weather)."
"best italian in chicago? no!are they trying to be? no!is it good? yes!will you go back? most likely!if you are italian, did your mom cook better? Absolutely!this is Chicago! and italian food is competitive!Mia's is accomplishing exactly what they are setting out to dogood food at an ok price, its not cheap but its not expensive"
So rude!
"decent select,everything taste fresh, well-cooked and perfectly seasoned.the best hot chocolate!better than Jacques-torres.great mexican baked goods.affordable,hearty sandwich.soups-comfort food at its best.I want to move in."
"I've been going to Nuevo Leon for just over 30 yrs. ��I always have the tampiquena. ��The plate has a generous sized skirt steak, refried beans, rice, avocado on a chip & a cheese-filled enchilada with mole sauce. ��Over those 30+ yrs, as I have gone to different mexican restaurants (I don't always get to pick where we go) I always try the tampiquena. ��In all those years, I have not found one that comes close to Nuevo Leon ON 18th STREET! ��I have tried the tampiquena at Nuevo Leon on 26th street, and it is NOT the same, so beware. ��It has a little of everything, so I get to have a variety of stuff, which I like. ��If you like booze with your food, it's BYOB. ��They have a small parking lot on a side street east of the restaurant (they validate). ��Other than that it's street parking and you can "
Excellent Mexican food and margaritas
"I am always looking for the perfect dog, well I have stopped looking. Hot Doug's is the mecca. I have tried most of their gourmet dogs which is hard since they change so often. Everything is great my only complaint is the long lines almost all the time."
This place is a great new bar on Lincoln Ave. ��They have an unique menu and a fantastic beer menu. ��They also have a great wine list and a great pour. ��I would recommend the burgers and arugula salad. ��The service is great as well.
"First off, let me say that I've been here 8 times and each time was great!this weekend my husband and I decided to stay a nice quiet evening at home but one problem, we were HUNGRY!so after a quick phone call, it only takes about 2-3 minutes to order. We tried their special lobster for the weekend. It came promptly on time within the 45 minutes the person on the phone told us. I'm soo glad I tipped the driver well, because that lobster so to die for!!!!!it was because of this outstanding delivery that made me want to write a review. The lobster meat was so tender, the sauces were just right, not too salt, sweet, spicy or sour. BUT just right. I also ordered their new fish sandwich, also very delicious. To top this seafood combination off we ordered the spicy shrimp sate dish. All very good"
"I went to Alinea for my birthday on November 8. My overall impression is that while it was a very interesting evening and worth the experience, I wouldn't do it again. There was something about the experience that was slightly sadistic. The insistence by the staff (presumably this is coming from the chef) that so much be eaten a certain way and in a certain order was very controlling. You were punished with dirty looks if you didn't do it the right way. On top of that they played a came of ?guess what this is with several of the dishes and wines. By the end I was purposely giving absurd answers just to see the reaction, which was typically kind of snotty.The point of controlling so much of the dinner seemed to be to craft a particular experience for the whole evening. It was all orchestrat"
Great.....just great! No further comment...go and see for yourself!
lol....! Just opened an account on Yelp with the same comment as Michael S.....ha! Pho with Cows Penis.....uuummm yum yum !! lolAnyhow....didn't feel like cows penis today so went for a chicken broth rice noodle soup with vegetables and was pretty good...I was surprised they really get a lunchtime rush going in here...but basic good pho at decent prices.
"OMFG!!! NEW ""SERVICE CHARGE"" WTF???...lets make this story short as i can...took my mom out for her bday 2 nites ago so total 4 people...order 3 bulkoki $18 each and an order of haemoulpajun $12 which total $66...good ole bf took card n paid without looking at receipt n came back with slip and i sign real quick...drove mom home n just realize i remember when i sign with the numbers $85.xx...WTF? drove back had him go in while i waited in car...so im asking him to ask her on the phoneme to him: y did u charge us almost $20 extra?her: we start today, new service charge, some girls do it cuz they said ""some people dont know how to tip""me: service charge for what?her: for serviceme: u mean tip? i thought i gave u cash tipher: ohhh she thought u give her ""extra special tip""me: i just came here "
"I had a bad service experience! went there tuesday night... the waitress didn't pay attention ... and kind of rude! �� �� the food was good but too much oil, the price was really good if you order the misob ( two vegi and two meat) it worth! �� ��well, I might go back...."
Excellent restaurant. Went by myself and sat in the bar. They were friendly and inviting. Had steamed clams and soft shelled crab. Raspberry pie. They were great. ��Got into a nice conversation with other bar patrons. Definitely would go ��there again. Not cheap but money well spent.
Food was just okay. ��Waitress was very good. ��We had a gift certificate and had $15 left to spend. ��We wanted to give our server a tip with the remaining amount but were told they couldn't do it??? ��Huh???? ��Very poor customer service in that regard.
"I am a vegetarian and still had a great time at this Brazilian churrascaria restaurant. I only partook in the salad bar and ordered the grilled vegetables, no meat. But the food was fresh and delicious. My mom and brother tried every cut of meat on offer and said the food was impossibly delectable. The service was excellent; I have not one complaint. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great dining experience. We will be back!"
I was just introduced to this place last week. ��I've been there twice now. ��Really liked the food but the second time I went there the sushi was mushy and we had to wait over an hour for a table. ��Not sure if the food is worth that long wait. ��The hostess could not commit to a time when I first showed up. ��We went on a Thursday night. ��I will give them another try.
"Gotta love this place. I love the variety of the menu. Waiting could be a little long sometimes, but worth it. Prices are very fair for the amount of food u get. The fresh juice is very good as well. Definitely recommended."
Q was highly recommended so we went for a late lunch early dinnerWe should of stopped with the pickles and chips........We ordered the Q3....very glad we shared this since everything was cold and nothing had any flavor.The ribs(baby back) were very fatty and I never experienced fatty baby backs before.We are big fans of Smoke and Fat Willies and Q does not begin to compare to either of theseAll I can say is we were very disappointed and.....NO NEXT TIME for Q
"This place is great. ��If you want to come at a busy hour, you'll need a reservation. ��Other than that, the service was friendly, the fish was fresh and the setting is really fun. ��There are some great deals on specials (esp before 5pm) that will bring us back for more visits."
Drinks with a bite. food with an attitude. ��My new favorite go-to spot in the city. Service has always been above par. Go now and you will soon realize how bad the Mexican food is in the city because nothing compares to Frontera Grill. Nothing.
"I'm actually surprised this place has gotten such high reviews. ��I'm assuming most people must be new to the place otherwise they'd have noticed the significant decline in the quality of the food and service over the past few years. ��Considering this used to be a spot I frequented 2-3 days a week, it pains me to see such a great place starting to fall offThe food is different depending on what day you go and who the guys behind the counter are. ��Sometimes it's ok, other times it's just plain awful. ��Their falafels are made well but usually sit out under the lamps for god knows how long which, combined with the runny, bland, Jerusalem salad, results in a cold, wet/soggy sandwich. �� These are NOT the same Sultan's falafel sandwiches I ��used to know and love. ��The lentil soup has a different "
"Yes, there always a long wait for breakfast especially on weekends. And yes you have to get there real early to avoid that. But that's a very good sign that you've made a good choice for breakfast. The coffee was fresh, the omlettes were well-made and the toast was just perfect. And not to mention, the numerous choices for jams and juices. The service was quick and friendly and we were done with the entire meal in less than 20 mins on a busy Sunday morning. Again, if long lines are like a plague to you then get there early. Ideally before 9:30."
"LOVE this place. ��Have never had a bad breakfast here. ��Service is friendly, efficient and very quick. ��Food is consistently excellent. ��Personal favorite is the Orange Bread French Toast, but there are plenty of choices to suit any palate. ��The coffee is just okay -- could be a better bean and cups could be bigger. ��Be prepared for a considerable wait during prime-time weekend mornings because this is obviously a popular neighborhood restaurant."
"losers overpriced and overcomplicated breakfast and lunch food poorly decorated, psuedo-neighborhood spot air conditioning that could blow you away cup of coffee only decent thing there to avoid freezing couple sitting next to me most idiotic conversation ever guy talking about some show that he saw last night where the performer changed her outfit like five times"
"Great greasy pizza. The thin crust stands up to multiple toppings which can sometimes be tricky. Overall it wasn't pizza that changed my life, but i wouldn't mind going back."
"I've been going to Bongo Room since it first opened in a small space underneath the Damen blue line stop... so I'd guess I'd be considered a loyal customer. ��However, gotta tell you... despite the relatively innovative brunch ��menu (e.g., banana oreo pancakes, smoked duck breast benedict), the food tastes lousy. ��I had the chorizo omelet on Monday and it was bland with a huge chunk of meat in the middle of eggs, with a too large portion of potatoes on the side. ��Boring... ��Also, there's always a wait on the weekend. ��When the space on Milwaukee opened the interior build out was cutting edge... not it just looks dated.One strong positive: my server Jennifer. ��She was friendly, timely and responsive.If you're OK with a relatively unique menu with food that tastes bland, but you get huge port"
Good Indian food with great flavors and freshness. I have eaten in many other Indian restaurants but none of the restaurants come even close to the quality of food and service of India House. I would definitely recommend India House.
"This was was my first time dining at Sunda and it went past my expectations. We started with the Rock Shrimp Tempura, which was amazing, and every course thereafter was better than the last. I highly recommend the Noodle entress that has pork and shrimp in it. Also, we got the steak entree. The steak was seasoned perfectly and so tender. Lastly, we finished off the dinner with the Ridiculist for dessert which is carrot cake with ice cream in the center.I will def be back!!!"
My husband and I love coming here for our breakfast every Sunday. The service is quick after the half hour wait to get a table. The staff is friendly. The food was delicious. The best breakfast spot in the SoLo.
I got to say - I just don't get it. This is Chicago. There are so many restaurants that are so much better. There food is simply mediocre. I guess they hand make their pasta. My grandma did too and there's doesn't taste anything like hers! If I wasn't told it was homemade I would never believe it. ��There service is incredible. They send you these postcard for $20 off around your birthday so that is a nice touch. there food is just mediocre and the atmosphere is pretty pedestrian as well.
"You can get a Chicago hot dog, greasy fries and a pop in lots of places, but this joint has history and is worth the trip. An unhealthy indulgence.And it helped that it was on the way home from my job out near O'Hare. I could shop for groceries at the Dominick's across the street and then drop by the Dawg for a dog."
"Wow! ��What else can you say great food, great price, and BYOB. ��The fixed price option is an amazing deal and plenty of food. ��Once I was there and was in a bit of a rush on the way to a get together but wanted apps first. ��They really listened and did a great job of speedy service."
"Only four stars? What does it take to get five stars in this city? I've lived here all my adult life, and if this place isn't a five-star place, then there's no such thing. Better food, and bigger quantities than you'll get anywhere else. Impeccable service and a romantic, truly romantic, atmosphere. By the way, you have to get there early and get a booth. Otherwise it can be kind of cramped. But if you don't do that, then it's your own damn fault 'cause you've been warned."
I am not sure that most of you are reviewing the right place. This restaurant sucks. The service is horrible both eating in or for delivery. They act like they are doing you a favor and believe me they aren't. The one good thing they have going is the falafel but other then that forget about it. They usually are out of some thing their rice sucks their lamb shawerma ��is dry and their lentil soup is so so. I have been to other middle eastern spots and Im sorry this place is near or at the bottom.
"Amazing!!!!I was visiting Chicago and this place was recommended by the staff at my hotel. The service was top notch, I've never been treated so good. From the first bite till the last the flavors in my mouth were perfect. I still dream about this place..."
"I love love love Pequods! ��Great pan pizza in fact thats all I order from there. ��Trust me if you order an appetizer you may regret it because you won't have as much room for the awesome pizza. ��Although reheated Pequods leftovers are always great. ��I go to both locations and I must say that the Morton Grove location is much less crowded and has a more rustic than urban feel to it. ��I am currently a vegetarian, but when I did eat meat my favorite topping was pepperoni. ��I also recommend the blend of onion, mushroom, and black olive soooo good. ��Overall yummy filling and comforting food."
"Polish sausage w/ BBQ sauce, what a novel idea! How have I not had this before! Love the fries. A little pricey for what it is, there are better hot dogs for a cheaper price out there, but its Superdawg...its just fun to eat there."
Love the food! Love the location. ��4 stars only because I feel if I want to share something off my plate because I ordered the salad bar I am an adult I should be able to.
This place is awesome! I would suggest getting the Peking Duck meal that comes with soup or noodles. I got the soup with also fried rice which they make out of the duck. They also bring these breads that are half folded to where you can insert your duck meat with a little vegetables and sauce to dip in. I only been here once but I would go again when in this area. This was suggested to me by my friends friend who lives in the area and boy was he right. The best Peking Duck and the fried skin was so tasty! A must have for anyone who likes duck.
"I enjoy the wine classes, how easy they make it for you to select wines for purchase, and I love the casual atmosphere. The staff is amazing!"
"Wonderful pizza, but a bit on the pricey side (those toppings add up). ��Free parking is a big perk in the neighborhood. ��Good atmosphere. ��Good staff. ��Solid."
"Best pizza ever! It was very filling and left me wanting more. We even took the extra two slices home on the bus. There is a lot of crust, but that is to be expected on a deep dish.Our service was not great, but it didn't ruin the experience."
"Although they say they open at 11, you must call in at 10 inorder to make a reservation, because ive never heard of a restaurant full in just 1 minute lol"
"The duck was fantastic. Greasy soft and wonderful in every way shape or form.I was here for a birthday party and we were having a blast and enjoying the pastries, beer, duck and veggies; in reverse to my expectations we received both the rice and the noodles at the end of the meal. Both were absolutely atrocious. The rice tasted absolutely charred as if someone had burned the rice to the point of on fire. Smoked rice is not good. The noodles that came afterward also were identical and tasted like they had been cooked in the same pan. I'd give this a re-review in the future just due to how cheap it is and I'll likely return and see if that burned flavor was an isolated incident. I'd consider leaving a 3 star for the duck alone but the service was pretty slow and the ratio of diners to servi"
"Best steak house in Chicago. The service was outstanding! Recently celebrated my birthday there and when we sat down, the hostess and waiter wished me a happy birthday. Food was absolutely delicious! Would go again anytime. The following day received a phone call from the restaurant asking how our experience was. Now that's class. Do not pass this up!!"
"I went for dinner last night ��and had an exceptionally average experience. ��The restaurant was really crowded and we had to wait for about 30 minutes at the bar which wasn't very pleasant.Most of all, I didn't find my food to be very good. ��I had the Lamb which was slightly overcooked, I certainly wouldn't order it again. ��The best part of the meal was that saganaki appetizer.I am unlikely to return."
Excellent seafood period. The servers were extra friendly and always there for our every need. We went on the Tuesday Alaskan King crab leg all you can eat night. Its been almost 24 hours and and still full. Those giant crab legs were tender juicy and dipped in butter. I cant wait to go back.
"I love Thai food! I crave it like a fat kid craves for ice cream! But on this particular visit at Opart Thai, my heart just couldn't commit.My boyfriend and I ordered the Tiger Cry appetizer and he loved it. I thought it was too salty, so we asked the waitress for white rice to neutralize the taste. The white rice never came, and by the time the waitress came around again, my boyfriend had already inhaled the rest of the food. We also had the wonton soup, which we both thought was too salty, but who orders wonton soup at a Thai restaurant anyway? Finally, we decided to share an order of basil chicken. I love that they use ground chicken by the way. However we asked for medium spicy and I believe we got extra extra spicy instead. My tongue was numb by the end of dinner.Overall, I thought th"
"Just got done eating here on a saturday night and it was a perfect evening out for my girlfriend and I. We did not have to wait long for a table and the byob policy is absolutely wonderful. Our waiter was attentive without being pushy, he really allowed us to settle in and drink a little wine before making our decisions on an entree. I had osso buco and she had fettucine alfredo and both plates were full almost to overflowing. The osso bucco was tender and delicious, I enjoyed every bite. Then we got to dessert, which was a giant slab of very tasty teramisu which we couldn't even finish. Overall I loved the fact that they do not rush you to make decisions or finish your meal and really allow the customer to savor the atmosphere and meal. We will definitely be back"
"Simply It is quickly becoming one of my favorite places to get take out. The food is delicious, fairly healthy (lots of choices for vegetables and rice and not everything is fried) and the staff is extremely friendly. I highly recommend the Pho Bo (beef noodle soup), Asian Vegetables on Crispy Noodles, and Simply it's Beef (Bo Luc Lac). These have all been great! The Pho Bo is a main staple though- reason enough to order!Also they always give you complimentary fruit on the side (for take out at least) and again the staff is so nice. If you pick up, you will certainly meet the owner who will offer you tea or water and cater to your every need (even if you don't have any). He's great! Go to Simply It!"
"This place is awesome. Generous portions for such cheap prices. The appetizers are all so great. We also had the entrana last time and it is delicious! Not many options for vegetarians but the carnivores loved it. The drinks come in great too. We have now been there quite a few times now. The waiters are all friendly but we had a great experience with one waiter in particular, Miguel - he went to lengths to make sure we were comfortable. The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because it doesnt have too many options for vegetarians. Overall great experience everytime we go there."
"This review is of the grocery store only and not the cafe. ��For years, I used to stop in here about once a week on my way home from the office. It used to be a great source for meat and fish, and had an outstanding bakery.The past year or so (and more so recently) the quality had really declined. ��Prices remain high, but meat and fish are barely above Jewel and definitely not on the level of Fox and Obel. ��Selection of meat and fish has declined. ��The bakery still is good, but it is tough to justify a trip just for the bakery. ��The selection of other stuff is often limited.It is too bad, but it is no longer worth seeking out."
Staying at the Double Tree Magnificent Mile..Just finished shopping ;waited in line 40min for a Totino's frozen pizza tasting deep dish. Truly the worst Chicago experience I've had. I would never recommend this place
"Let me start by saying I love BYOB restaurants, seek them out, and praise them when deserved �� I am extremely adventurous in terms of sushi, and have been very rarely let down. �� I went here with a friend and saw the high rating on Yelp and was expecting to be amazed. ��Maybe they didn't get a fresh delivery when I was there, but I had to spit not one but two different rolls out in my napkin due to a stale fishy taste and chewy consistency. ��I have been to many, many sushi places in Chicago, across the country, and a couple places abroad. ��I love trying unique maki rolls, nigiri, and sushi . �� So for me to have to spit out two different rolls in my napkin was extremely shocking because I have never once had an issue with even the most daring sushi. �� �� ��Also, they have a $6 corkage fee. ��Th"
my husband loves Brazilian steakhouses. We've been in fogo and brazaz. Then we went to TDB. We really liked the service that the Head Gaucho gave us. ��He was very attentive. He made sure ��that the Gauchos served the meats the temperature we liked. We'll definitely be coming back .
By far the best restaurant in Chicago...I cannot get enough of this place. Their Chitown bowl is delicious and their wings are sweet and spicy...oh and did I mention huge. A lot of food for your buck.
Always love this place all you can eat meat coma! I do not suggest for vegitarians
"The food at Mia is very affordable and, generally, very good. ��It's not the food that made my last experience so awful--it was the service. ��The waiter did not know the menu, lost our dinner order and never really apologized for the long delay in getting our food. ��There are other places to go in Lakeview where food and prices are equally as compelling and the service is just better. If you have bad service, you should alert the manager. ��Service quality has been falling dramatically over the past year or so."
"Hella Yelpers,Pambo say eat a the Barbacoa. ��Muy Bueno, Amigos."
"If I weren't so impatient I'd roll 5 stars. ��It's not their fault they can't service all us as quickly as we'd like. ��Their food rocks, people know it, so people show up.The wide options are great and duck fat fries are to die for.I'd go more often if it weren't for the wait time and the fact that all of the fat in the food makes my stomach crazy."
Mashed Potato Pizza with the white sauce! Yum Yum! It has always been busy when I come in here so I am not sure which is a better night to come but I suggest stopping in at least once to eat and have a Delicious Micro-brewed beer!
"Outstanding. if you've never been there to eat, you really got to go.I can't say enough good things about Irazu. the owner and staff are a rare type of restaurant service."
Always a great time! The food is always excellent along with great service! Good to see they expanded a bit so more people can squeeze in.
"This place is so HOT! The decor is such that you move out all the tables and chairs and move in your home furniture and it's your dream home. Comfortable, sexy, good pricing. This is where I will have my birthday party!"
"After visiting The Purple Pig on multiple occasions for lunch and dinner since the restaurant opened, it is easy to see why Buon Appetit magazine recently rated it one of the country's ten best new restaurants. The food is delicious. The staff is very helpful, always professional, and they look good too. The atmosphere rocks. At Michigan and Illinois with outdoor patio seating, it is up there with Chicago's best. I have broken down their menu by section below. What I recommend: Antipasti: Pork Fried Almonds (You never thought an almond could taste this good.) Olive Oil-Poached Tuna with Greek Lima Beans (This is a must try!) Salads: Mixed Greens with Feta, Radishes and Red Wine Mint Vinaigrette (I don't eat salad often, but this dish makes me want to start.) Fried Items: If you can, try ev"
"Service is horrible, Manager can't guarantee if the vegan option are actually vegan. There are healthy options but don't count on them being low in fat or calories."
"Great encased meat emporium. If you've ever wanted some exotic meat, Doug has made it."
"This particular excursion took place on December 19th, 2011. ?My family and I were eating breakfast here at the Chicago Diner the day prior, when I saw a picture of a yummy sandwich that I really wanted to order. ?I was going to order it immediately after breakfast (because I'm a fat ass), but decided to wait. ?The sandwich is called the Texas Mushroom Melt. ?It consists of a monstrous stack of Texas toast, beefy seitan/veggie patty, melted 'cheeze' topped with vegan horseradish mayo & garlic sauteed mushrooms + onions, and is served with a side item & dill pickle. ?I also added Upton's seitan bacon to it as well. ?I mean, you gotta go all out when you eat out. ?Am I right? For a side, I did the sweet potato fries. ?I also told them to throw in a side of macaroni and 'cheeze,' and to top i"
"LOVE this restaurant. We eat there all the time. The beet and potato salad is delicious as are the sambusas. For dinner we always get one of the sampler platters (worthwhile to spend the extra few dollars to have access to anything on the menu) and try a few new things each time. I'll be honest: the service is pretty bad. BUT, the servers are VERY nice and they give great suggestions for menu items. And, I think the service is getting better, as I have recognized a new manager who seems to know what he's doing.Overall, a wonderful place that I will continue to return to because the DELICIOUS food FAR outweighs the mediocre service."
not good. overpriced. walk down the street to toast. friendlier atmosphere and better food!
"I tried the California omelette, which I found very tasty! ��Everything else was what you would expect from a breakfast place. ��Service was friendly and fast, so I left satisfied. ��Will certainly return!"
"I've been to Icosium a few times now. ��I love their coffee and that the water comes with a sprig of mint. ��The crepes are pretty good (not perfect to me, as I like thinner crepes) with great fillings. ��The servers are friendly but sometimes it takes a little work to get your order in. ��The only time it's bothered me was on a hot day when I had to go up to the register and request water after waiting for ten minutes. ��Other than that you just get the sense the waiters will come when they know you're ready, and again they're very friendly once they do come around. ��Overall great, though if you expect lots of attention from your server maybe avoid peak hours."
"I went to Carnivale for a pre bridal shower. I really didn't like the food it was just a little too spicy for me. However, the drinks and the service was great. I love to try new and different things, so we had a couple specialty drinks and our waiter was coolest guy. He wasn't hovering around us but at the same time he was attentive and sociable without being annoying. If you like Latin or spicy food this is the place for you. I will go back but only for drinks."
"food here is excellent, you cannot argue that.this is corporate owned lettuce entertain you but this place is super expensiveand most people know this going into itwhen you go somewhere to pay top dollaryou expect everything to be top notchand everything that i ordered was excellentthe only beef i have on this place was my scallopsthey tasted good but they were brokenthere were three of them and none of them were together, they were pieced togethernow, if this was a place where you get 3 scallops for like $7 then I would not mindbut that is not this place, they should not be piecing together scallops for the price you paythey should be whole pieces that present nicely to the eyes as well as the palletwhen i want to spend money and have excellent food, this is one of those places to go to"
"Never been treated so badly at a restaurant. In a nutshell...Running late for a 6:00 rez. Called and notified we'd be there at 6:15, was told no problem. Showed up at 6:20. One half of our party of 4 came to claim the table, while the other half went to park. At 6:25, the owner comes over and growls, ""When's the rest of you're party coming?""""They're parking, so whenever they find a spot."" ��Saturday night in Andersonville. ��Who knows how long that'll take.Owner stomps away. Five minutes later, he comes over and says, ""If they're not here in five or ten minutes, we'll have to do...something."" Lots of attitude.I say, ""Are you gonna throw us out?""He stammers for a second, then says, ""It's been an hour. ��You're an hour late.""I say, ""It's been just over 30 minutes, and we called to tell you were"
"I have always been a fan of Giordano's ��and this review is NOT for their pizza, because it is always delicious, but it's for the treatment that we had. I ate here with a business convention group of about 10 people. It was in the middle of the day at around 2pm and honestly, we could not get our waiters attention even if we searched and asked around. We had two extra guests come and they were waiting for 20 minutes for the waiter to notice and bring extra chairs and plates. The thing is, they were not even busy so it doesn't make sense why it took another 20 minutes for our water to come. Maybe this location is not good or just this waiter, but it was just unacceptable service. but don't get me wrong, the pizza is always amazing, this review is solely for the service."
"We first went to Mastos for a business dinner, we sat at the Bar. Ryan was our server, she introduced herself, and made us feel welcome. We were unsure on cocktails and appetizers, Ryan made wonderful suggestions and made the evening a great success ! On the next trip into Chicago, we again visitied Mastro's. We again sat in the Bar area, this time at one of the tables, our server was Leigh, she like Ryan, introduced herself. Leigh helped us ?with our selections for drinks and dinner, once more a very enjoyable evening. Great food, excellant service!"
"It is true that the Hop Leaf has a wide selection of beer. I suppose that this is a plus if you are or you know someone who, instead of just ordering one of their standard favs, prefers to pick and choose between 20 or so different European beers, taste it and then tell everyone at your table how your beer tastes so different, and how it is so cool that it is served in a goblet-like glass, and how it tastes kind of like raspberries. This same kind of person would enjoy paying $7 or so for each one of these fancy beers. This same kind of person would order from the Hop Leaf the cashew butter sandwich (a fancy way of making a peanut butter sandwich taste bad), or some other high-priced, not-so-tasty meal. If you are this person than you will love the Hop Leaf. I am simply not that person. An"
"Dirty, poor service and poor value.1. ��Dirty. ��The place is just not clean. ��The food preparer didn't wear gloves and was fingering my food. ��There were bugs on the floor (ok, sometimes that can't be helped) and a fly was annoying me the whole time I was there. It is very dingy inside.2. ��Poor service. ��The order taker had a bad attitude. Period. Spoke English with a heavy accent, and seemed ticked off at me for not understanding what he said. ��3. Poor value. ��For over 5 dollars for a simple hot dog and 5--yes, count them, 5 french fries, the hot dog was very soggy and messy, the pickled tomato juice got all over the bun and fries making them soggy and ruining any flavor that might have been there. ��Five cold and tasteless fries? ��Seriously? ��The box it comes in squishes the hotdog and fri"
"Get the deep-dish. ��Don't bother with anything else on the menu.... this is the only thing that matters, but its hands-down the best in the city. ��The best anywhere, in my opinion."
"Been going here since the place opened when Opart was actually there. If you have to drive there, parking can be a bitch. The wait can be tough too but once seated, ��and I recommend not taking a table in the front room, you're in for some great Thai.Cheap and plentiful I think.A fave w/the lesbian crowd. They like it hot too!Tiger cry beef, Basil beef are quite nice.Afterward, hike over too Lincoln square proper & visit Cafe Selmarie.More Lizzies there too (lots) but the fresh pastries will soothe the Thai burn. Srawberry roulad or banana eclair ought to do it.Burp"
"This may have been my worst experience at a restaurant thus far. For some time I had been dying to go to Frontera with my girlfreind and when the opportunity presented itself I was eager to visit the establishment, having heard so many great things about it. Plus, I love Rick Bayless, his interpretations on some classic dishes which I have found in his cook book are delicious. I also visited his newest eatery, XOCO, and while I enjoyed my food, figured better things were to come from Frontera. So last saturday, five friends and myself went there at 5:30 pm. We put our names down on the seating list and were told to expect a 3 hour wait! We said, hey we are here and we wanna try this place so we spent the time walking around downtown and grabbing drinks. We returned to the restaurant at 7:3"
One of my favorite restaurants in my neighborhood! Large portions mean bang for your buck. I've never eaten anything here I haven't loved. The service is always great and free parking in a lot across the street is a huge perk for busy Clark Street. YUM.
"First the waitress (Debbie) forgot my order so the 7 people I was with got theirs well before me, then the waitress had to ask me what I ordered, then she brought it out wrong. I also paid $2.50 for a coke and finished it before eating, and she never came back to refill it. We saw her only two times. �� ��Secondly they do no split checks, so you have to write down how much your total is and the amount of tax you are paying on yours. If you have a card then you have to pay the tax and tip on your card because they don't take it out of the cash. Which can be complicated when you go with 8 people. �� ��Then when you call the dark haired manager with the big glasses over after waiting for LITERALLY 45 minutes after you finished eating and complain about the way things are set up, he will rudely sa"
I have never had their pizza because I cannot seem to stray away from their chicken dinner... It is amazing can feed a few people and is only 15 dollars! They have a typical delivery time of ~40min.
"I visited Wilde's on a Tuesday night and was seated at a small table in a crowded area surronded by a noisy family. I ordered Shephard's Pie with a lemonade. The waitress ignored my request for a few orange slices to be brought with the drink. The food was tasteless and didn't have much meat in the pie, mostly gravy and overcooked small vegetables.I was told that there would be a charge for a refill of the soft drink. I could understand if the lemonade was freshly squeezed, but really at $3.00 for an instant drink...unacceptable. When the waitress brought the check (which was over $15 for such a small meal), she asked if I wanted change from a $20, why was she deserving of a 25+% tip?I will NEVER return to this establishment!"
"First of all, our server was AMAZING! She was so funny and extremely knowledgeable. She didn't skip a beat when we asked for her recommendations and listed suggestions off of each part of the menu. Service is always such an important part and I was really excited by the service. Secondly, every drink I had was delicious! My friend and I split the champagne margarita and boy did it go down smoothly. Then I had the tamarind margarita which I was a little iffy about, but why not go a little crazy. Ummmm seriously so good. It was spicy and smooth and really interesting. The food was also really good and extremely interesting. My shrimp dish had fern as an accompaniment, like the kind you see when you're hiking. And it was surprisingly good. The one dish I would really, really recommend is the "
"My daughter and I had dinner here one Saturday evening. I love this place!The food is good, including the desserts. But the wait staff, wonderful! It's fun watching them weave around customers with graceful competency."
"Whenever I take friends out for Korean, the default restaurant of choice is San Soo Gab San. Granted the atmosphere isn't fancy, but isn't it about the food not the surroundings one is after. If you're going to order pajeon (seafood pancake), make sure you grab the edges first as the middle part is a little soggy. The kalbi is sublime; they're pretty generous with the amount of beef they serve you.Highly recommended!"
"great value -- ridiculous amount of food, could easily share with someone else.i got the zamboni crepes and it came with 2 crepes, a generous portion of potoates, and 2 pancakes! everything was delicious.we had about an hour wait so we walked through grant park, hilton chicago, and the public library (harold washington)."
"Very dissapointed with the guacamole and the margarita's nothing really special. ��Very surprised to hear it was voted the best restaurant in the country??? ��We have read several reviews before we went, of course there will be both negative and positive reviews. ��Well now we know there is nothing special about this restuarant. ��Please people save your money and go somewhere else."
"This is one of the best places I have ever gone out to eat at and trust me I have gone out to eat at too many restaurants. I have always fancied myself as a man who loves a good steak. A well done filet mignon is exactly what will put me in a good mood after a long day of work. The vibe inside of the restaurant is incomparable. We sat next to the 2 story wine cellar which was spectacular! The whole time there was an acrobat inside who was performing mesmerizing twirls. I have travelled all over the world; however, I have never come across anything like this.Now onto the food, wow! After splitting a delicious bottle of wine with my business partners, we decided to flip over our circles and start eating. The men who brought the different kinds of steaks and chickens were very skilled. Not on"
"So cheap, so good. I'm always full & never spend more than 5 bucks."
"Fantastic Pizza, Fantastic Selection. ��This place does slices better then anyone else in the city!! ��They have prefected all three styles; Pan, Stuffed, and Thin Crust all are great. ��The best part is that during all hours of operation they have any style slice with any ingrediant hot and fresh ready for you to eat.I have subtraced 1 star because on 2 seperate occasions the delievery came far beyond the promised time, however they still managed to get the pizza there Hot and Fresh!!"
"I wanted to take my wife out on a romantic dinner. She only likes beef or steak. Not one to like seafood, not even lobster. She was skeptical when she read the menu and was mostly Asian cuisine. She ordered the spring rolls for starters. Then she got the bo la lot. Name says it all, it was enough to feed both of us. Same goes with side dish of house chicken fried rice. She enjoyed it immensely. I had the ground beef w/sate platter. It tasted wonderfully. The ambience. Music, candle lite and professional service made the experience unforgettable for my wife. The place was sheer romance. The website also alloes you to purchase flowers and it was on our table that night. Totally swept her off of her feet."
"The food is OK but god help you if they get something wrong and you speak up. The manager / owner will argue with you rather that address your complaint. He values being right more than he values return customers, and he is the owner of all 3 Yolks in Chicago.I'm not the first person the make this comment on Yelp, and I know I won't be the last.Also, the place is always crowded, closes at 2 in the afternoon and has bad acoustics. It's difficult to carry on a normal lunch conversation here. Not worth the expense if you know good food and good customer service."
"Food is excellent... my wife, who lived in Italy, said this is the best pizza she's had in the U.S. ��Only drawback is that it's relatively expensive for a pizza place."
"Don't go out of your way, but not bad if you're in the neighborhood, want some pub food, and are willing to pay fine dining prices. ��We've eaten at the Gage twice now. ��Our first meal was probably closer to 3.5 stars. ��Great pork chop and pretty good burger. ��Our second meal was closer to a 2 star. ��Some significantly undercooked mussels that we couldn't finish was the bummer of the night. ��The flank steak appetizer with watermelon and goat cheese was an interesting mix of sweet and savory, and the rest of the meal was simply average. ��In terms of the food overall - this place is not going to knock your socks off by inspirational cuisine; after all it is a gastropub. ��But if you stick to items that sound like dressed up pub food you probably won't be disappointed. ��It will be a decent meal"
"My husband and I were in last weekend and, as usual, we were pleased with our meals. The Mac & Chreeze was creamy and delicious and our Bloody Marys were well-constructed and highly effective. What stood out about this visit was the fantastic service we received from our server Aaron. ��Like every weekend, the place was packed. Servers were scurrying around everywhere, weaving in and out of folks on the waitlist, avoiding diners on their way to the restroom. ��Though the conditions seemed high-stress, Aaron never faltered for a moment. He was friendly, calm, and thorough; attentive without being intrusive. In a situation where any server deserved a pass, Aaron delivered completely. His attitude added to our experience. The Chicago Diner has solidified it's position on our Must-visit-when-in-"
"I ate here last night and I have to say, great place! ��I have to admit, when I heard the patio was in the parking lot I thought, yuck, but I was completely wrong. ��The patio was nice and comfortable with beautiful flowers all around. �� �� ��Delicious food too! My husband and I were nervous because we usually eat pretty plain American food and didn't know how to approach the somewhat fancy menu. ��We were both going to just get a burger until our server saved us and sent us in the right direction. Her name was Shannon and we loved her. �� I had the rib eye which was so juicy and flavorful and my husband had the chicken dish with tomato and basil and croutons. I was a bit scared of the gorgonzola on top of the steak she recommended but she convinced me I would be ok and she was right! It was soo"
"Tucked away in an unassuming location Sprout is a quiet triumph. It has a understated yet stately vibe with excellent contemporary downtempo music pulsing in to the night. ��The staff was very knowledgeable, enthusiastic and attentive, but never cloying or invasive. Every dish I had was incredible. The Octopus had a smooth unexpectedly firm yet buttery texture. The combination of the light sauce and the nicoise olives ��made it the most appetizing tentacle I've ever had. The champagne/raspberry palate cleanser was startlingly piquant and certainly shocked me into the next state of mind for my entree. ��I had the Short Rib plate. The meat itself is stewed to a saucy perfection with amazing pioppini mushrooms in a delicious gravy. BUT! ( ..and here is the whole reason I signed up and logged on "
"An actually ode to marketing rather than food. ��About 45-60 people an hour move at a glacial pace creating a line for -- a hot dog and fries? ��Hmmm, and I bet you all wouldn't even be talking about this place if they moved people faster and had let's say 5 people in line. ��The story is the line and if this place is so popular why don't they address the ridiculously slow pace. ��Years in the restaurant business has taught me that hype is king. ��Too bad I really wanted to like this place. ��Tourists and people taking pictures of themselves standing in line. ��What's next bread lines?"
"Big Jones was a treat. We went for lunch and were the first guests to arrive. By the time we'd finished a tart and smoky fried green tomato and bacon sandwich and a steaming bowl of hearty mushroom etoufee the place was definitely filling up. The service was like the service I've had at some of my favorite places in New Orleans, not too fast, not too slow, backed by a bright smile and strong opinions about what you should order. Our server talked me into a side of fried okra that was among the best I'd ever had. My fiance loved the decor which had a great down home vibe, but I thought it seemed a bit unfinished, with no art or other personal touches. Overall, we loved it and will be back to try dinner and brunch."
2nd time I've eaten here - not coming back. Their guacamole was soupy - couldn't even taste the avocado (no seriously). Tacos Al Pastor were below average ��- didn't taste like Pork. But most of all the service was bad - where was the hostess and literally saw our waitress once until after we ordered (when we got our check)?
"We had the pleasure of dining here last Saturday night and had a fantastic time. ��The food was delicious...we had so many things none of us can decide what our favorite was but I am leaning toward the calimari or the mushroom pizza, or the selections of cheeses or actually, the cantaloupe vodka. What really put it over the top, though, was our server, Erik. He led us to some choices that we might not have made that were fabulous. ��It's great to have someone with an opinion who really knows the food, especially in so new of a place. ��We can't wait for our next trip."
"Had brunch at this tapas restaurant yesterday and was really surprised what a bargain this place was. ��8 small courses (including dessert) for $25 and an all you can drink bloody mary bar for another $8. ��I don't know how they make money doing this, but I was glad to be the beneficiary. ��Be warned the menu is set so you can't just order what you want, but that wasn't a negative in the least. ��All courses were fabulous though I did find the biscuits and gravy course a bit heavy. ��The bloody mary bar was great as well-- 3 types of tomato juices to choose from plus a load of mix-ins. ��Stellar place and a stellar deal."
Great authentic Brazilian steakhouse. ��A bit pricy though.
"I've been to Nana's twice now, the first day they opened and this past Thursday. ?The first time the service was a little slow but I did understand that it was their first day and they were all feeling a little over-whelmed with the HUGE turn out they had. The wait was a little long but I've waited this long if not longer at most of MY favoriterestaurants!. ?I tried the pancakes with strawberries and I must say they were deeeelicious! ?The servings are not huge but I do feel they are just the right size for you to leave satisfied. ? I went with a few people so I also got to try a little bit of the crepes with mixed fruit and they were very good, I also tried the home fries....mmmm, they were cooked just right! ? ?Their applewood-smoked bacon was cooked just how I asked...extra crispy, and "
"Had a plan to go here for lunch today, had sign up saying closed for cleaning. Upon a closer look, I saw on each door a big orange sign saying shut down for health violations. They had the doors open saw it was hard to see the city signs. The violations I saw checked off wereunsanitary kitchen conditions, roaches, rodent droppings and a few others I can't remember. YECH!!!!! So I guess it will be a few day before they reopen. But ""I won;t be going there! Anybody else see the signs?"
"i had the trio steak ��en tree with the different crust topping. ��when i received my meal i didn't think it would be fulfilling, but it was and the steak was succulent (like cotton candy it melts in your mouth). i also had the key-lime drink with was delicious as well."
"Tried the beef and lamb kabob combo. The meat was tender and delicious, and I definitely recommend the dill rice."
"I live right down the street from this place so I'm here a lot. The alcohol selection is great and the food is good (but I agree it's overpriced--I know it's expensive for the owners of this place to buy local but they don't do enough with the cooking to make it really worth the extra cost). I typically come here during the week and take part in whatever special they are offering, whether it's Tap Tuesdays ($4 draft beers!) or half priced wine bottles (on Thursdays now, used to be Wine Wednesday). The bartenders are friendly and professional, and know what they're talking about enough to recommend something based on what you tell them about your tastes. And when I've taken family here for full meals the whole crew has enjoyed it."
"Just ate here this morning with the GF. ��We both ordered egg sandwiches and they were quite delicious! ��I could do with out the hashbrowns that came with the sandwich, but overall I was very impressed. ��My GF ordered and ICE-TEA which had a very unique taste. ��I will definitely be heading back to Glenn's Diner for brunch."
"I really love their crepes, and sometimes go out of my way just to have them for lunch. What always surprises me (in a good way) is that their savory crepes are just as good, if not almost better, than their sweet crepes. Whoever their cook is really knows how to make my mouth water!"
Favorite restaurant in Chicago.
"Best food in Chinatown! ��As soon as we sat down we got hot tea and spicy cabbage. We ordered the potstickers and steamed buns as a app. So tasty, the potstickers came with 2 dipping sauces. ��We couldn't get enough. ��For the entrees we ordered the dry chili prawns and the house special chicken. ��Food came very fast and was perfect. The bill was $35-$40 which is cheap! ��We will be back"
"WOW.... I have eaten at most of the Brazilian style steak house around the USA, but Brazzaz and its staff, David, Alonzo and all of the gouchos were absolutely TOP NOTCH. I have my own business and I would be PROUD to call these guys my employees. The food was insanely perfect . If you like good meat and fantastic service, this is it.....you would be a fool to miss this this place. Joe from Alaska"
"Sandwiches are great, very creative and well thought out. I think the service can be a little bitchy at times. If you can get past that, the food is good. I'll be back."
"I only had drinks and appetizers at this place, but I' was impressed. ��Beautiful space, innovative drinks (a bit on the sweet side, but still yummy) and some great eats. ��Would love to try dinner here, but will probably find myself planted in the bar drinking the same drink and sampling more tasty morsels!"
My fiance and I stumbled into this place one evening looking for a good Italian place. The ambiance was nice and the food was really good. Fresh bread with oil and cheese before the meal and the drinks were great. Pricing was a bit on the high side. However we filled out a card after our dinner and were sent a personailzed post card with a letter and a $15 for the next time. Good place!
The best burrito in Chi town. I love this place
"If I were to die tomorrow and asked what I wanted as a last meal, ? I would go here and order their pork chop. ?The Best pork chops I've ever tasted in the city. ?First went here for my birthday as a gift from my little brother. ?I was curious about the place since I walked by it a thousand times. ?Once you walk in the atmosphere quickly changes. ?Very pleasant. ?The menu can slightly be compared to Sabor Y Cuba on Wilson and Wolcott but more upscale and expensive. ?This has become one of our parents-nite-out spots. ?scale: 1-10atmosphere: 9 (dining area tends to be too dark for my liking but eyes adjust after a while).Beverages:7 Great imports selection but mojitos are overrated and to expensive.Food: 9 ?Best pork chops in the world. ?Good Cuban selection.When coming here I highly advice "
Get the pho. and bring a white girl/guy as your date..
"The food was fantastic, the service was the worst ever!! Our waitress was rushed and had our sides brought out before our entrees. Then, when we asked for the sides with our meal, the waitress brought them out with our bill. I am not kidding. Aside from the horrible service and very dark lighting, the food, on the other hand, was fantastic. I had the pot roast and my husband had fish. Both were great. Everything was fresh, well-portioned, and beautifully prepared. I would go back on a weekday when it's less crowded."
This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend to eat at before heading over to the museum ... but sadly I was very disappointed. ��We ate at the bar and I ordered the House Poutine because ��I am a huge carnitas fan. ��There was about a teaspoon of carnitas pork and the rest was soggy greasy french fries with cheese and some vegetables (which did not seem to fit with the dish). ��On the up side my daughter had a burger that she loved and the third person had a salad that was ok. ��I may try it again or I might not.
"I had heard Garcia's had authentic Mexican food. Wrong! I had a steak ranchero and the sauce on that steak was not even close to the ranchero sauce I've had at other places. ��My husband's tacos were extremely greasy. ��I ordered a Margarita and felt like I got a shot of tequila instead. ��That was a waste of money because I ended up not drinking it. The place looks dirty and to get a refill on a drink it took quite a long time. ��I'm new in the neighborhood, and I like to check out new places and often give them a second chance, but I'm not going back to Garcia's so if anyone knows of a good AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant ��in the ��neighborhood please let me know!"
"Entrana and Bandejo Paisa and Pollo - Oh My! ��Nothing to be afraid of here, Dorothy! ��Just great grilled steaks, pork, chicken and seafood! ��We tried a number of menu items, but can say we highly recommend the tender and juicy Entrana (skirt steak) or Bandejo Paisa (ribeye). ��Also, try the Pollo (chicken): pounded, marinated and grilled to perfection! ��As you enjoy the food, you'll appreciate their friendly and efficient service, as well as the comfortable, spacious seating and surroundings! ��""There's no place like home,"" I mean, like Las Tablas!"
"This really is a hidden gem in the Gold Coast. ��This place is tucked away and very unassuming. The food is well priced, portions are big and quality and variety are great. ��I've been here mostly for brunch, but they do also serve lunch and dinner as well as a full cocktail menu. ��If you go on a weekend for brunch there will usually be a wait, but it's worth it."
"There were a number of issues:1) The ma��tre d showed herself to be unqualified for the job.We had a reservation for 24 (2 tables of 12). ��Upon arriving and finding that the tables weren't ready, we were told we'd only have to wait 10 more minutes. ��We had to wait an additional 30-45 minutes past our reservation time to get one table for 12. ��The second table for 12 ended up not being free until several hours later. ��It appeared that the groups who were 'just above to leave' from the second table had in fact just been seated when we arrived. ��The other 12 people in our party split up and sat themselves around the restaurant in a fit of frustration and confusion.The ma��tre d was less than helpful throughout and in conversation refused to accept responsibility for the errors in seating -- ins"
"Me and a group friends stopped in the other night to hang out. ��We loved this place. ��None of us are wine experts, but we all enjoy it....and the environment here suited us perfectly. ��We ordered several different flights, I particularly enjoyed the South American flight. ��What really struck me was the way the staff was so friendly and down-to-earth. ��Not too pretentious at all, and extremely helpful with making choices and explaining things...I can't stand snobby attitudes, so that is a big deal to me. ��The atmosphere was great, and they have a wine shop as well so we all got to take home a few bottles! Definitely an excellent choice for a great night out...."
"Awesome! ��I've been about five times and it has definitely become a favorite restaurant of mine. ��My frequent visits have afforded me the opportunity to sample a variety of dishes and they are all delicious! ��My favorites are the steak tartar, bone marrow, fries with aioli, pot roast, brussel sprouts, mushroom and truffle pasta, lemon meringue pie, chocolate cream pie, and the coconut mocha cream pie which is probably the most delicious dessert I've ever had!"
"This place was absolutely horrible. I went in as a celebration for a job promotion I got with some of my friends and the whole experience turned into a disaster. The food wasn't that great but most of all the service was bad bad bad! I found hair, that clearly did not belong to me and the waitress told me it was mine! My hair is pretty light and the hair I found in my plate was black! I should have not have to fight with my waitress with this kind of situation??! I eventually got a new plate (probably waited about 45 min!) but they seemed so annoyed about the whole thing. Definitely will never go back!"
"i just really like the food there. the servise is very uniqe :) you need to have patience and enjoy only the food and cooking , and close ur eyes on anything else ��:)"
"Neither fancy nor upscale, but great food served by nice people. This is the best Cuban food I have found outside of Miami. ��Well prepared food, helpful service, cheerful ambiance, and an overall friendliness. ��It was a very cold December night, and we greatly enjoyed the warmth of this dining experience."
"Buen ambiente y carta de vinos. Mi corte, la especialidad, estuvomsonre cocido,,pero acompa��ado de una ensalada exepcional.Muy recomendable experincia"
Delicious breakfast items and the smoothies are awesome.
"This place is pretty good for what it is. ��I really just want to talk about the waffle fries--so good. ��Also, the late night menu lets you build your own burger using like 80 bagillion options and mine came out super tasty. ��I'm not much of a drinker, but the cocktails they had were pretty good. ��My bf and his friend enjoy the beer and wings. ��This is a great place for people watching (I like to sit on the second floor and look down at all the desperate men). ��I'm not a huge fan of pop music, but I have to say that the dj-ing is pretty darn good. ��It's loud and crowded, but that can be cathartic in a good way. ��The service is good too (albeit valley-girlish)."
"I'm lucky to live so close to the Bad Apple! ��I haven't yet seen such an extensive beer list that's so NOT overpriced. ��I love knowing I can walk in there on any given day and have a delicious beer for less than $5. Their burgers are good, not the best. ��But I used to live around the corner from Moody's, so I've been spoiled for all other burgers. (Although BA's variety of burgers is much better than Moody's)Contrary to some, I LOVE their homemade ketchup!! (and I tell them that every frickin' time I'm in there) I'm not a huge fan of store-bought ketchup, so it's a refreshing change.It does get crowded on weekends, but to me that's a testimony of how awesome this place is!"
"Very rarely am I speechless, but all there is to say is:The best meal I have ever had, period."
"Super long waits, poor service, decent brunch.Overall, our party was rushed along after waiting 45 minutes for a table of 3. Was told that we had ten minutes to order because it was a high traffic area."
This is the greatest mix of Thai and sushi I can find. The sushi is not the greatest but it is good and cheap. The sushi regular gives you 8 pieces and a roll for $15. Perfect to split as an appetizer and then the seafood madness is the perfect meal. Love it!
"Really love having this place nearby. ��Beer is awesome. ��Coupe D'etat, Cross of Gold, and Bottom Up WIt are my favs. ��Really looking forward to trying the Milk Stout this year! ��We go here to grab a drink every now and then, but really happy they are bottling so I can pick up at the liquor store. ��Also, they have some pretty killer fries."
good Italian food. ��Service is a hit or miss
"THE BEST BURRITO IN CHICAGO, HANDS DOWN. ��Thank god for La Pasadita. Nothing but a flour tortilla, perfectly marinated meat, onions, cilantro, and I like sour cream. No bullshit like beans, corn and other veggies. Love it!"
"Lots of rave reviews, yet it was only okay just average decent lunch prices and sitting outside in the warm breeze on a Saturday"
"my husband likes this place. ��i wish i could jump on his bandwagon. ��the pizza is just, mweh. ��Big, super big, but mweh. �� I like their beer though. ��And thankfully we can get that to-go without having to hang out there. ��Nothing against Piece, just its clientele. ��But seriously, the beer is amazing."
"It's amazing that the best fish I've had in the city is in this location. Fresh fish prepared in really unique ways. Great service. Good crowd. Laid-back atmosphere complete with cereal boxes behind the bar and a chalkboard menu.If you go, don't even think about anything on the printed menu - go straight for the chalkboard (brunch or dinner). Pretzelled walleye is amazing, as is the arctic char with spicy shrimp sauce. Jumbo bloody mary is presented with enormous shrimp and other tasty garnishes. If you're heading to Glenn's though, do understand that it's not your typical diner - make a reservation or be prepared to wait, even on weeknights when they run specials."
"Great Food. ��Grilled Pork incredible. ��Try the coconut rice, ��just to die for!!!!"
"I have been coming here since I was a baby. If you are looking for a truly authentic cheap mexican food this is place for you. ��It is BYOB and there is usually marachi music blasting from the juke box and tacky Mexican decor all over the restaurant. This place gets packed after a Sox or Cubs fan. Everyone just piles in drunk with cases of beer. ��I recommend the $5 combination (taco, tosada, mole and tamale). ��You really can't beat the price. ��Also the nachos are to die for!!"
was there sunday night with 8 in our party. ��owner told us that we could have free bottle of wine if we paid cash. ��tacky to say the least. ��no free refills on coke. ��not good!food was tasty. ��waitstaff had trouble understanding english. ��my party would not go back
No need to waste anyone's time with this review. ��This is just to confirm that Hot Doug's RULES!
"Really nice vibe , beautiful venue... Also,they ��have original samba dancers once in a while, ��fun ;)"
very good pizza and good specials. Little guy at front cashier gives lousy service and is cocky and acts 6 foot six but the pizza is good. Many times the place is open at posted time but the pizza is not ready for additional 20 minutes so do not be there as soon as they open.
"I can't believe how good this food was! I am not a huge fan of BBQ but this place was very good. All the food we had was fantastic. The hush puppies are to die for. ��We had the competition ribs and they were out of this world! ��Homemade key lime pie OMG!Chicago is full of BBQ joints but this stands above all the rest. ��It's so hard to find a BBQ place that doesn't just slather their meat with tons of sauce. ��Here all the BBQ is dry rubbed with the sauce on the side. ��You can actually taste the superb quality of the meat and you don't even need the sauce. ��My date on the other hand did add sauce, but it was very little.The service was great. Not too pushy and gave us time to enjoy the food and convo and our cocktails were always full. Our waiter Brian was so helpful and knowlegeble about th"
Mercat was a very enjoyable albeit somewhat predictable tapas experience. They offered a variety of dishes ranging from some very creative and delicious items to a few rather unimaginative bland dishes. The food overall is some of the best tapas around and a few items are absolutely amazing. The service seemed fair. The staff seemed less than enthusiastic.
"I have to admit, I was timid about trying Ethiopian food. ��But what's life without trying new things?! ��I bought a Yelp deal for Demera and finally decided to go with my husband and sister. ��Our server was pretty quiet and looked confused by some of our questions but we finally decided to order the combo platter, with half veggies and the other half chicken, beef, and lamb. ��I was pleasantly surprised by all of the different flavors and the huge portions. ��I especially liked the spinach and the chicken. ��What I wasn't crazy about was the texture of the bread-I compensated by using as little as possible and using mostly just my fingers to pick up the veggies and meat (kinda gross but also kinda fun at the same time!). ��We also had a turnover-like spinach appetizer that was amazing! ��While I"
"been there several times attempting to redeem my experiences...but unfortunately it is just getting worse. ��-ordered the lox and bagel..waited 15 mins for my food, then they tell me they are out of salmon-change my order to a 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup. ��since the second thing i ordered was cheaper than my first, they offered a side salad along with that to make up the difference...they forgot my salad and the rude hostess attempted to blame it on the kitchen when i saw the salad sitting at the pick up station for the staff to bring to their tables for at least 10 mins. -my friend got the brussel sprout salad...brussels were completely undercooked and you could barely chew them. ��again the rude waitress said ""oh, i eat it all the time!"" assuming that we are just telling her that to make "
"I would give an A+ to the atmosphere and overall experience. ��The food was very good, but not good enough for the prices. ��I think presentation sometimes trumps flavor here. ��The quinotto tart with goat cheese and peanut sauce was interesting but lacked something. ��The ingredients were unexceptional, it seemed like something I could make at home. ��The potato pancake with quail egg appetizer was equally disappointing--it just tasted like mashed potatoes. And I've definitely had better churros. ��The highlight of the meal was actually a side of mac and cheese I ordered! ��It was creamy, more like fettucini alfredo, and coated with crispy breadcrumbs. ��Excellent sangria, too--not too sweet and with a hint of citrus. ��Probably the best sangria I've tasted. ��All in all, this place is worth a try,"
"Gilt bar, you have answered my prayers!! ��All that I have been longing for...I stopped in over the weekend for a cocktail with friends and was blown away by the dark, seductive interior. Tiny lights twinkle like the night sky in dining room, above salvaged tables and tufted leather settees. Loved the thoughtfully conceived drink menu; they also had an impressive draft list, as well as some interesting wines by the glass. The bartender was well versed AND friendly (big plus!). ��Dinner plans at a friend's prevented us from ordering food, but the menu was definitely tempting. Approachable share plates like a shaved veg salad, roast chicken, burrata, meatballs... Yum.Gilt bar is set to fill a void we've had here in Chicago for a long time. Finally a vibrant late night locale with ambiance (gre"
Great Food but expensive as hell
"VERY VERY GOOD!!!I arrived a bit early and waited for my boyfriend at the bar. ��This was just the beginning of what was to come. The bartender"" Fritz"" was a great bartendeer, taking the time to suggest different drinks as I was unsure of what to have. He explained to me all about cachcasa and the Brazilian drink that is made with it. A great combination of lime and suger- delicious. ��When my boyfriend arrived we sat with him a few more minutes as he suggested wines and told us all about the restaurant.When we sat down, the hostess could see from our expression that the area was a little crowded and moved us to another table by the windows. Our waiter came over and explained to us all about how a brazillian steakhouse is with the chips for the gauchos and the rest of the pertainent informat"
"Despite the waiting, waiting, waiting which I'm obviously not great at - I can't even take a star off because I enjoyed the food so much. Veal cheeks with morel sauce, pork belly with avocado mousse, belgian beef stew, mussels and frites - all to die for. If you can't find a beer there you like, well then you probably just don't like beer very much. I wish it wasn't so far away from my entire life in the west loop, but it's well worth the drive and even the dreaded wait."
"Simply it has great food, but TERRIBLE customer service for delivery. ��They pick and choose their own hours, despite what their website says. ��Very frustrating. ��Also, they ��gave me a hard time for ordering only one entree for delivery even though it was over the order minimum on the website"
"This pizza is absolutely the best deep dish in Chicago. ��The carmelized crust is the bomb. Sometimes it is sausage, onion and mushroom, other times it is canadian bacon and pineapple. ��Everytime, it is mouth watering delicious. ��Delivery can take a long time, so if you are able to pick it up yourself, you can get your slice of heaven much quicker, but if not, it is well worth the wait."
This place is definitely FRESH FRESH FRESH as someone else said.I think one of their appetizers the fresh vegetarian rolls are really good. Avocado wontons and the shrimp springrolls are always ordered when my friends and I come in. We're regulars at this place and the owner Tuan always loves to send us out extra drinks. Their service is always consistent and working to get you fed. some entrees I've tried here in the last few months that I recommend to everyone are as follows:+pineapple callamari+sate shrimp+simply it's beef+simply it's beef noodle soup (for those cold days)+vegetarian delite+lemongrass chickenWe've come in just about every weekend and each and every time has always been fabulous! thanks Tuan!
"Great place to go for any type of celebration or just out for a nice dinner. ��Great food, great atmosphere and great service."
"Great restaurant to come to w/ friends & family. ��Nice atmosphere -- love the library-style seating area in the back of the restaurant. Newbies:Try the curried mussels, Chipotle black bean burger, Country chicken pot pie, or the Wilde Mac n Cheese."
Banana pecan pancakes with caramel sauce were fantastic! Just way too big for one person!
awesome pizza!!!
"Fantastic, probably one of my favorite places to eat in the city. Im a big fan of latin food and this is at the top of my list. Ive eaten here a few times and always enjoy their beef dishes. I also attended a mojito making class and it was awesome! The teacher was patient and we were were provided with many snacks as well as got to drink all the moitos we could make. Im all about hands on education :)They've got a few big tables and private rooms, so if you're going with a big group be sure to make a reservation."
"If I could give a different rating for the food and the service, I would rate the food a 4 only taking one star off as it is really pricey but so delicious and the service a big fat 0 (which I wish was what we had left our waitress as a tip!) We went for a friends birthday which also happened to be Christmas Eve. There were 7 of us in the party and we were all looking forward to eating here. The waitress seemed indifferent at first and this theme seemed to continue through the night. Drinks and food were ordered and she went on her way. Plates started coming out however only a few at a time. The staff served some of our party and left the rest hopelessly salivating over the others food. It was a good 20 minutes before the whole table was finally served. During this time, we asked the waitr"
so i went to this place for fathers day with my father.... M. hanerys was way to long of a wait. as our second choice i think this was a good choice. both me and my father had the eggs benidict and it was pretty good. his friend had the wheat pancakes i think. i guess he kinda enjoyed them. i did like the venue though. very relaxing and mellow. the service was great. coffee was eh...... not illy.
If you are tired of Fogo DeChao and are ready to try something different this is the place .The salad bar is not as good as Fogo but the food is very good they have a great variety not just red meat .The pace is slower but it gives you time to talk and enjoy your food .The decor is nice and very relaxed .
"This past Saturday was my first ever visit to Carnivale. ��Now, I've been a Yelp member for a while now, however, I tend to lurk in the shadows. ��My experience was so out of this world that it left me compelled to comment. ��Yes, this restaurant is stealing my reviewing virginity. ��We were sat in the bar area (the white table cloths were not flattering) which kind of put a damper on my expectations. ��you think bar = drinks and apps/get in get out sort of thing right? ��wrong.The food was awesome. ��I ��order the NY which was intimidating but delicious and my date ordered some sort of tenderloin with cheesy mash. ��The cocktails were great, heavy on the tequila which I loooooved. ��Mojitos=good. ��Tequila flights=amazing.

Celiac's beware!!! Meli's lists several items which are gluten free - I was very excited about this because I have celiac disease. When I talked to my waitress this past Friday at lunch about gluten she didn't seem to know what I was talking about - so I went the safe route and ordered a basic salad. The salad arrived with a piece of bread on it - so I explained that I can not have wheat (at this point it wasn't worth describing what gluten is) and asked to have another salad made. In half an hours time I found I had been glutened! I'm still sick (usually getting sick from gluten takes about two weeks to get over). I called the restaurant to let them know what had happened. A gentleman named Chris implied that I had called to try to get a free meal as well as implying that Meli's didn't ge
"Awesome, love the dogs, love the the decor, love Doug! ��Lots to be said about an owner that is always there and pleasant to boot!"
"fantastic restaurant, great staff and atmosphere the salad bar sucks though!!!!willl be back"
The skirt steak was excellent. Great drinks as well.
"i hadn't been to this place since 2002, when i last lived in chicago. ��i have been staying here now for 2 weeks. ��last night, i went for a late run on the beach followed by a swim. ��then i thought i'd go out for a coffee. ��i was on the northside, about to go to Kafein in evanston, when i reconsidered - perhaps i'd want an alcoholic drink. ��i wanted options. ��i wanted the 3rd coast. ��i texted a friend who lives in california now to get the location, since i had forgotten exactly where it was. ��on lake shore drive, a dashboard indicator light came on; i wouldn't be deterred. ��i arrive, there is open parking directly across the street, probably not a common occurrence. ��the proprietor was there, uncommon again, late as it was (about 11:30 pm), and she and i got to talking over wine - deliciou"
"I used to come here every Saturday with my friends and have coffee, study and have something to eat. ��The teas and coffees are great and the food is yummy as well. Great place to hangout in the Gold Coast."
"Loved the trendy Asian fusion vibe, felt like I was at the Tao resturaunt in Vegas! In the heart of River North close to a lot of other bars, so if you wanted to go somewhere after dinner! The place was lively, yet relaxed a great balance. Once complaint I do have is the service was not up to par. Our waiteress was extermely moody, so friendly at first, by the end of the our meal she looked flustered. Overall food and location are amazing."
"We went to the grand Lux Saturday night and it was a great experience. They sat us down in a timely manner (for a Saturday) and the waiter (I think his name was Thomas) did a great job. The menu tosses a lot at you, but overall picking an item under the subcategory you want makes it easier. I know they are similar to the Cheesecake Factory but I think for being more upscale, the prices were not too bad. It's great for a meal after a day of shopping, but definitely not an every weekend thing."
"It's over.I remember just over a year ago when I eagerly checked RevBrew's blog, anticipating the progress of my neighborhood's very own brew pub. ��I've been to Revolution many times since then, and I think it's time I call it quits.Revolution has become too loud, too busy, and my dining experience last night did me in. ��My mussels were a bit too slimy for comfort and my veggie reuben was a seasoning disaster. ��I also tried the mushroom pizza - fresh crimini's and just a hint of truffle oil - not bad but not enough to warrant the price. ��To put it simply - the menu is all concept and no performance. ��It's no longer enough to throw a dash of black truffle oil onto an entree and pull inspired, chef-driven dining 'out of a hat.'Here's the thing - I'm willing to overlook mediocre food at a bre"
"I got the groupon here. IT WAS SOOOOO WORTH IT. My friend and I went on a Monday so the 25 $ was worth 60$!!! It was absolutely ��amazing. We got two servings of the chocolate and cheese fondue so, we actually got full! We first ate the cheese fondue which it was so rich. You could taste the alchole in the cheese and it just gave it this unique flavor. Our waiter was amazing and everyone was so thoughtful and kind there. The atmosphere it absolutely amazing. It is very dim but I really like it that way. People were complaining that it smelled like oil. I honestly barely noticed it and when I did smell it, it smelt like home which I really loved. ��The groupon doesn't cover tax so we made the most out of our 60$ and we bought the gourmet board and we got three fancy cheeses with assorted meat"
"All I can say is WOW!!!!!!!!!!! This has easily moved up as my favorite restaurant in Chicago.....service was like no other i have received; the chef came by our table to make sure we were enjoying our meal and so did the owner. ?The patio was a beautiful escape from the otherwise non-scenic Halsted st; lets just say they lived up to their name, this place was really a little dream :)"
"Piece officially serves my favorite pizza in Chicago. ��Be prepared to wait a long time for a table on the weekend, but it's worth it. ��We recently ordered a medium pizza with sausage, mushrooms, and onion, and it was enough to feed 3 people. ��We waited an hour and a half for a table, but the pizza came out around 15 minutes after we ordered. ��It was hot, well-seasoned, perfectly cooked, and had just the right amount of cheese. ��The sauce was delicious too. ��Highly recommended."
"My husband and I really wanted to like this restaurant. ?We have been wanting to try it for a long time, and then we saw a groupon for it, so we jumped at the chance. ?We started with the yummy warm bread, and the delicious beet soup. ?So far so great. ?But then, the very loud, annoying owner entered the restaurant. ?I kept hear him saying loudly, THEY LIKE MY FOOD! ?THEY LIKE MY FOOD! ?He was going to every table asking if they like his food. ?So he reaches our table. ?For some reason, he didn't ask us if we like his food. ?He asked us if we had a coupon or something. ?So we said, yeah, we had a groupon. ?So he says, did you make a reservation? ?(clearly annoyed) ?My husband told him we did not, but informed them upon entering the restaurant that we had a groupon, and if we needed to call"
BEST INDIAN FOOD AROUND.My family & I often visit this place for their great buffet. The decor is wonderful. I myself love anything spicy and i get it here.The staff is amazing with their serivce & very welcoming. After visiting a few other places in the area I would by far say this is #1 on my list.
"Really good, inexpensive, traditional mexican. ��Can be a little greasy. ��Everybodys mom makes it better, but this is as close as you are gonna get. ��The outside of the place is very cute painted. ��You get chips and two kinds of salsa when you sit down, the prices are pretty low tamales were $6 and came with rice and beans. ��A good place overall and polite service"
"I ordered the beef, mango, & coconut and it was FANTASTIC. ��Along with the tofu spring rolls. ��It was an excellent service and a great surprise. ��It was the first time we have ever ordered from here and I have to say we will be again. ��Just wonderful."
"The sloppy joe will change your life. I'm not a 'loose meat' gal, but this sandwich makes you believe in a God (pickled jalapeno, hello???). I think they could pepper in a few more interesting beers - but the sloppy joe really cancels out any possible criticisms I have about L&E. The decor is most excellent and I'm so happy to see a cool neighborhood hotel open in Chicago (better late than never). Kudos to Longman & Eagle for taking a risk - it has paid off! (Can I buy your beautiful jukebox?)"
"Uh... I don't get it. ?Yeah, Frontera's food is good, but I didn't quite get why there is so much hype. ?The food is good, no doubt about it, but best restaurant in Chicago? ?Let's not get carried away.The most surprising aspect of our visit was the preparation of the margaritas. ?I know a restaurant of this size needs to streamline the process of preparing their most-requested drink, but after ordering a margarita at the bar, the bartender simply reached behind the bar and grabbed a mix, poured it into a glass with ice and handed it to me. ?Margarita in 10 seconds. ?Tequila + mix in a big ol' jug. ?At least add the tequila or do SOMETHING to make it authentic.Overall, not a bad experience, but not the best either. ?Go EARLY or make a reservation or you will wait, wait, wait... and it's a "
This is a great place--really friendly owner and the food is great--fresh and delicious--Though it might be because I go here with a friend of the owner they always give us complimentary dessert
"They have some real good carne asada that I have ever tasted, Good tasting orchata to drink. I really like this area of town. The burritos are pretty big and filling. ��The menu is not large which is nice I hate when there is too much to choose from."
Hot dog for hot dog the BEST hot dog in Chicago by far. Way better than Hot Doug's (which is just a Vienna beef dog). The flavor of the Superdawg is absolutely amazing. FANTASTIC! A+++++
"My husband and I have been meaning to try this place since it opened-and I'm glad that we finally did! We loved the charming, southern feel to the place (almost a brighter and well lit Violet Hour) as a backdrop to the comfort food. Our waiter was excellent, provided just the right amount of detail on the menu and gave great recommendations. We started with the crab cakes for an appetizer and they were small yet wonderful, they had the perfect crunch. My husband had the shrimp and grits and I had the pork chop. I'm not a fan of grits, but my husband thought they were fantastic. The pork chop dish? WOW! The sweet potato hash combined with the baked bean puree was out of this world. �� The food isn't the healthiest around, but the portions are pretty small so I didn't feel too bad indulging! "
"Based on some of the reviews, I made a reservation with some sense of being disappointed. ��TRU turned out to be one of the best meals that I have ever experienced, including creativity, service, and overall enjoyment. At first the atmosphere seemed a bit stuffy, and the coordinated water pourings a bit hokey, but as the evening went on I appreciated the attention to detail in both the service and food. The sommelier was great with a sense of fun. The 6 course tasting menu showed more creativity than Moto. ��On the whole, this was worth the money for an exceptional fine dining experience."
"Love the mojitos and love the brunch-we have tried just about everything on the brunch menu and have enjoyed everything-plus kids get a free large pancake! ��Love the Carne al la Parilla for dinner and my husband always gets the Almond Crusted Halibut-both are great. ��Overall, we really enjoy this place."
ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!!sweet potato sushi blows my mind!check out my blog - http://barredowl.wordpre��_ - for a longer review!
"Great place to have dinner when going out for a night on the town.My friends and I came in from out of town for my 30th birthday and I wanted a place to have a good meal and something that was nothing like anything else where I come from.The food is great and I like how the menu changes daily based on what they have on hand. The prices on the menu are moderate and you can leave the restaurant without having to spend more than $40, including food, drinks and tip.The only thing that I have against the place and the reason why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is the wait we had. I had a reservation for 10 and only half where there, so we did not get seated until 8 of us showed up. So I will suggest to eat here by all means but if you have a large party, make sure they all get there on time or you"
I make this a special treat every month. The pizza is the best in Chicago and the award-winning beer is brewed on the premises. The service is always great. The only complaint is that the restaurant can get ridiculously busy toward the end of the week.
I have been to the Chicago and Berwyn wishbone restaurant for over 6 yrs. I love their food and they have a very neat environment. Their sweet pudding is the best. You gotta try it.
"Went there for a dog, fries and coke. Nothing special. Food below average. Felt it all weekend. Hart burn with headache and constipation.Good for a younger guys with healthy livers. Is there no star rating?Ben"
One of the best steakhouses in Chicago!
"Fantastic chinese food...the mongolian beef was great, the spicy tofu was wonderful. The pan fried noodles were also very tasty. The crispy duck was eh, but maybe that's bc I was expecting peking duck."
"Took my kids, aged 9 and 13, after spending a day at the Zoo. We ordered the Tofu Spring Rolls, Chicken Pho, Lemongrass Chicken, and the Simply It fried rice in the clay pot. Neither of my kids have had Vietnamese before and they both absolutely loved the food here.The staff was attentive and and the complimentary lemonade and fresh fruit dessert are a nice touch as well as being very refreshing on a hot summer day. I really enjoyed their Tofu spring rolls and the Pho. My son loved the Lemongrass Chicken, and my daughter preferred the Fried Rice and the Pho. The Pho wasn't the largest bowl I've ever had for the price but the flavor was excellent and the noodles were perfect. The Lemongrass chicken wasn't quite spicy enough for my sons liking so he spiced it a bit with the spice for the Pho"
"My favorite place for pizza, and now my favorite place for chicken too.Normally I get a 2 slice deal and a drink for like $6 something plus tax, and now I am hooked on the chicken too...Think I have been there 4 times in the last 10 days!!!! �� Got the 1/4 chicken with rice and bean, pita, and a pop for less than $6.I like to eat out, can't cook with crap, so I need good places with good prices. �� The Bar-B-Q pizza is my favorite, and normally grab the Italian Sausage slice if they have it out..They are always mixing up the slice options. I call ahead on the chicken when I am in the Loop, and they have it ready when I get off the Diversey stop to dinner..Folks at counter are great here too..Like old fashion, nice people..the pizza guys know me by name too..Tops in Lincoln Park by far..Ps..T"
"If you're looking for true fondue, this is the place. ��From lobster to steak, fine cheeses, overall fit for a king! ��(with a dinner bill to match!)Found a coupon on Groupon. ��If you can find a deal, it's a great place to go."
"My 91 year old Aunt loves hot dogs, so when I came to the City to visit her only one place came to mind for lunch, Superdawg! I hadn't been there in 20 years as I don't live close by. But it was awesome! In high school we use to eat and hang out there every weekend, circa 1968. It was great to be back, and our food certainly surpassed my high expectations. So great to have this old landmark which is good as new. Thanks SB!"
"So after checking Lockdown's website, myself and a few friends made our way over to Lockdown last week to see AC/DC and Maiden in action at Chicago's first ""virtual venue""...Let me preface, I've been to dozens of Rock/Metal concerts from Metallica/Maiden to Atreyu/Slayer/In Flames. ��I know what I like and I like what I know. ��I've been to several Rock bars in Chicago as well as outside, and there is a certain ""asthetic"" or stereotype that follows almost every Rock bar I've been to...Namely, places with ""character"" (see: dingy) with bad attitudes and good cold beer. ��That's the way it is and like it or leave it, that's how it's gonna be... So we walk in and see the walls lined with HDTV's literally every direction and Angus Young is ripping a solo and Brian Johnson (god bless him and his ab"
"Some of the food was great, some was just ok. ?The staff in general was very good, but our server was HORRENDOUS. ?Ordering was like being in the Twilight Zone. ?Each person would say what they wanted, and she would repeat back something totally different. ?After we finally managed to communicate to her what we were ordering, she still brought one of us the wrong dish. ?Her attitude could not have been more I don't give a shit, and she seemed super annoyed when we asked for basic things like cream for the coffee. ?It really was shocking, since this is supposed to be a nice place. ?It felt more like the Golden Nugget at 3 in the morning. ?A disappointment that the food really didn't make up for."
The best authentic Mex restaurant in Chicago. Been going there for 20 years. It can get crowded but they'll usually bring you a nice FREE appetizer to soothe your hunger pains.
"I've been here many times and the service is always stellar, which is not that common any more. �� Atmosphere is warm and comfortable with great lighting. ��I didn't like the scotch egg but the mussels were great and so was the Gage burger.Always has a good crowd and the location is great by the park."
"I had an overall great experience at Geja's! Everything was delicious, the service was wonderful, and the atmosphere was great! The Sangria was awesome and knocked me off my ass. I really don't have anything negative to say about this place. Definitely a date/couple atmopshere, but could be fun with a small group of close friends... if you want to drop a bit of money. I will definitely go back!"
"Great food!!!!! ��I came here for Breakfast and it was amazing. ��The service is great and the staff is friendly!!! ��If your up for trying something new come here. ��Their menu's change with the season but amazing..From what we were told everything is organic and from local farms. Again great place, decent prices, great food."
"We waited in a line that wrapped around the building for 45 minutes. The hostess constantly walked around checking on everyone and they were serving samples of beer. Our waiter was quick, observant and very helpful. We did wait another 45 minutes for our pizza, but after the first bite it was clear to me that it was well worth the wait. This is definitely a must have if you're ever in the Chicago area."
"Tried it out again with some friends, and we all agreed that some of the staff need an attitude adjustment. Our server (female) seemed bothered when we couldn't decide what we wanted. I ordered the cauliflower and lentil dish and it was really good. Will be back to try some other dishes, but will go when it is not so crowded."
"This place is Meatastic! It is a little expensive, but hey, what do you expect when you get to eat as much delicious cuts of beef, pork, and chicken as you can handle. Not to mention the amazing salad bar..I try to stay away, but I never can. Even the sides are delish. Grab a $50 and head out, but don't eat all day...get your money's worth."
"Food is overpriced and not good. Anytime, I have to spend $30 for rice and beans and vegetables, there is a problem. The food was just not good. The portions are nice sized. The batidos were good. Especially the mora y guanabana.**UPDATE**I am big on customer service...after all that is what I am paying for in addition to the food. Irazu gets an A++ for customer service. I appreciate it when management reaches out to its patrons and appreciates their business. After reading my review, the owner Henry, sent me a message apologizing for my experience and offered me a complimentary plate in exchange for trying Irazu again. I will definitely give them another try solely based on his response. I am a small business owner, and really appreciate other small businesses that go out of their way to "
"Very good food, breakfast is amazing and the Wilde burger is awesome! Good selection of beer and the waitresses are always friendly. Great bar"
"I have been to Brazzaz before and honestly, I prefer them.. The salad bar was okay, but I wished they had things labeled so you know what you were eating. The meat was wonderful, but I truly did miss the pineapple and shrimp that you get at Brazzaz for the same cost. The service was great though and they were quick to refill your sides and bring more meat. Most meat originally came out rare to med. rare so we had to wait for them to come back with med to med-well."
"I had a phenomenal lunch here. ��Arrived at 2pm on a Saturday and waited in line for about 45 minutes. ��We bought a couple of beers and some chips and guacamole to enjoy while we waited. ��The staff was very friendly and helpful. ��There's no pressure to find a seat, they'll find one for you. ��Someone passed out menus to look at while we waited in line. ��At the counter they assured me I could come to the take-out line after I finished my meal to get a hot churro. Had the Woodland Mushroom and Ahodaga tortas. ��Both were incredible. I found the Ahodaga to be extremely spicy but super delicious. ��The Woodland Mushroom melted in my mouth it was so tasty. ��The two of us were so full by the end of the meal, but attempted to stuff down some dessert. ��I got into the take-out line to order a few churr"
"Zero stars for attitude, 3 stars for food and service. ��I like their food, and their prices are somewhat reasonable... But.... They are very unfriendly toward single people. ��I normally dine here with friends and family, but this night I went alone after work and asked for a booth, and was told that none were available. ��They then offered me the bar. ��I looked around the corner and saw 2 empty booths. ��Not only did they lie to my face, they were completely disinterested in my business. ��I thanked the lackluster woman behind the desk and told her I'd find another restaurant, whereupon this overweight italian bully, who I'd only imagine as the owners spoiled son, barked at the disinterested woman as I walked out asking her what I had said...as if he were looking for an argument or fight from"
"My husband and I went out on a date night and we figured we would try the newresturaunt on Taylor Street-since we love spening time there. The wait was about 30 minutes-taking no reservations. The food was fantastic and the Chef ��that prepared our meals was great. Every portion we had was to die for-feeling beyond filled up when we left. Great music, food, drinks, and prices!"
"Problems: We waited over an hour for ONE pizza that we had pre-ordered in order to save time... yet, no time was saved. ��We got to Giordano's at 7:30, ""pre-ordered"" at 8:20, got seated at 8:50, and didn't' get our food till 9:30... surely something must be wrong. ��As we sat there we saw one family finish eating and paid, watched the table be bussed, watched a new family be seated, watched that new family order and then eat their food, while we continued to wait for ours. ��The waitress avoided us, not even making eye contact. ��The only time she was attentive was when she was trying to collect our paid bill. ��The pizza was NOT HOT, at best room temperature. ��Having been so hungry we just ate it but left a shit tip.You've been warned. For ""world famous"", you think they would have figured this"
"Overall, I've been pleased with this place. Street parking can be difficult since Andersonville can become fairly busy. Once you're in the restaurant, you'll find good service and good food. Their eggs benedict are actually quite good. Their cocktail selections are very good too."
"Food is great, we had the Kalbi and the Daeji bulgogi, it was amazing. The pan chan was overwhelming and great too. 2 thumbs up"
"The jury is still out for me on this place.First of all, I just want people to know that I am a big fan of Indian food.I had a good time the first time so I decided to go back with some friends for the second time last Friday night. ��Everything was tasting pretty good until I saw this little black thing in my salad. ��As I examined it more closely, I was shocked to realize that it's a dead fly. ��At this point, I tried to not let it ruin my entire appetite. ��I quickly informed the waiter of this and he didn't seem very surprised. ��As he took the unfinished salad away, he said he would take care of this.Long story short, I managed to work up an appetite and ate part of my entree. ��When I finally got my bill, my waiter told me that he had taken 25% off the price of my dish.I don't know..I'm cu"
"Probably the best Italian style pizza in Chicago. I like DOC too, but I think SN is better. My husband is a big fan if thin crust pizza and he is also very picky about it, but we both loved it! We also had a couple of appetizers and they were delicious too! It's definitely worth going back, even if it's out of our way"
best italian restaurant in chicago.
"I don't think it's the best deep dish pizza in Chicago, but it's pretty good. Pricing is reasonable too."
good pizza
"When a friend said we were canceling our pizza and I have to say I wasnt happy, but when I was told we were going to Wild Fire, I was more than thrilled. ��I love the feel of this place. ��If you havnt been there, its a tiny bit old school where it reminds me of a super club. ��I love the food, my fav is the salmon with the spinach, and garlic potatoes, oh and the chopped salad as an appetizer. ��Having gone to Key West for many family vacations, I have to say they have a great key lime pie. ��And you know, every time I am there, literally, the place is packed!! ��And we were there on a Tuesday night!! ��I highly suggest reservations a few weeks in advance!! Oh and they have a new red and white wine flight thats awesome!!!!"
"I haven't stopped thinking about, dreaming about Alinea!!!! I had the tasting menu and I loved every course--the service, the presentation, the flavor, oh, the flavor and did I mention: ��THE FLAVOR! Simply the best!The next occasion or event you know where I'll be!"
"I lived in the neighborhood until 3 weeks ago, went there on a regular basis until I asked myself, "" why do I pay to be mistreated?"" These people are truly the rudest ��I have encountered. ��They obviously don't like children, they dont like to answer questions about there food or menu. ��The food however, is good, and changes on a regular basis. There are two people their, that are very nice, one being the latino bus boy, and the other a young lady with long dark hair. ��But for them, I would be giving 1 star. ��In my opinion Janiks, down the street is a MUCH, better option."
$10 worth of food served for $20. Arrogant bartenders serving 5 ounces of beer for $8. Stay away from here.
"Nana is terrific! ��Local, organic, intelligent, delicious fare--far better and more imaginative than the similarly themed Nightwood a few blocks north in Pilsen. ��As a guide, Nana rivals Lula Cafe in terms of creativity and organic/local. ��I've had breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner there (I live in Bridgeport) and can vouch for the quality and innovation-factor of each meal. ��Lately they've also been concocting some terrific seasonal cocktails. We love going and chatting with Nana herself. ��This place was created by two of her sons--both smart, savvy chefs-- and you can generally find the rest of the family there as well. ��This is a Bridgeport family who saw the opportunity to improve the culinary offerings of the neighborhood and have done so with taste and style, while maintaining an a"
"Timewaster. Over-priced. Emotionally disturbed staff. GO ELSEWHERE. When you go to Fox & Obel, you are paying for its location. It is a few blocks away from Navy Pier and across the street from a metropolitan movie theater. Where does all the money you pay for this offensively expensive merchandise go? The rent. And the owners. I am certain the staff barely clear minimum wage. Once, many years ago, this place was a quaint specialty shop with friendly service and a relaxing atmosphere. I suppose the ownership has changed, which is why the restrooms are often foul, the pastry cases are full of gnats, and the staff look and act as though they should be on complimentary anti-depressants. You'd be better off going almost anywhere else."
Seriously. This is probably one of the most pretentious places i have been to in Chicago. And been to a lot. Service was HORRIBLE. Simply HORRIBLE. Bar service was extremely slow. Hostesses were rude and unhelpful and the waiter was simply stupid. Up side. the food was not that bad. Although a little generic. Save your money and your time.
"Great place to go for a wonderful meal or just for a drink after work. Lovely decor inside with cozy fireplaces. The food is delicious. My favorite is the herb roasted rotisserie chicken. ��The street parking can be difficult, but well worth the hassle."
"Eat here eat here eat here eat here.I've been to XOCO and Frontera, and I grew up watching Mexico: One Plate At A Time. Which means that I love Rick Bayless a lot, and his food soared above my expectations.Yes, it's a bit pricey, but very filling. Yes, the lines get long--the wait can be unbelievable--but 100% worth it. TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT. Come with friends so that you can chat while you wait. I'd also come before you're hungry since you'll probably be in the line for a while.I've had both their soups and salads, and they're wonderful. Well-seasoned and very filling. The guac and salsa is also excellent. If you like hot chocolate that leans towards bitter over sweet, then try theirs--if nothing else, it's a unique experience. I'm also usually a fan of stuffed churros over not, but thes"
"3.5 stars, actuallyThis is a LUNCH review. ��Two, actually.The first time I came here for lunch, I had the Migas - corn tortilla & egg casserole with chilies, black beans, red salsa, avocado, creme fraiche. ��It had pieces of burnt junk from the griddle on it. ��I was absolutely disgusted. ��My companion had a burger which was delicious. ��This was quite a while ago.I came back here recently for a business lunch. ��The iced tea was quite delicious and my glass was kept full. ��I felt sorry the server for having to use the unnecessarily small and heavy glass pitchers that the tea and water were served in.The ""cornbread"" was amazing. ��Imagine a corn turnover. ��Crisp and eggy on the outside, light and fluffy in the middle. ��It was perfect, except that the butter was unspreadably cold and hard (not t"
"This review is long overdue.I've been patronizing Mayan for over a year. We found it on yelp last year while looking for a Mexican restauraunt with an outdoor patio. The outdoor patio is small, but its outdoors! Also, from the outside, the location isn't fancy, nor do they have a big fancy sign outside with trendy letters, but don't be dissuaded!We were so pleasantly surprised by how amazing and authentic the food is. I love spicy food and the enchiladas supreme with the green sauce does the trick. I've tried just about everything and its wonderful, but that chicken dish rocks!So, now that I've talked food, lets get to the important stuff---MARGARITAS! I've had them everywhere---including Mexico and I can't even find the appropriate adjective to describe how delicious these are. They offer"
"We got married this past January and had a lot of out of town guests, so we wanted to do something different. We wanted a real Chicago wedding with Chicago pizza, so we had our rehearsal dinner here. It was so much fun, we made it fancy by setting a dress requirement and having our florist come in and decorate it and put place cards. The staff was so helpful and we had a blast. Writing on the walls was a plus. The private rooms upstairs really helped out!"
"Huge restaurant, huge menu and huge proportians! Good place to go if no one in your group can agree on the cuisine. Its pretty touristy, but what can you expect, its on the mag mile"
i love the food. the service can be a little slow but very good overall. recommend this place for good steak.
"We LOVE Simply it. My husband and I moved to Lincoln Park and were lucky enough to be .5 mi from this gem! The service is wonderful. The staff is SO friendly. The staff remembers us every time we come in and 9 out of 10 times brings us a free appetizer or hot tea. ��The food is FRESH and delicious! And, it is BYOB! This is our cozy go to place! We love it! Must try! ��We recommend the Lemongrass Chicken and the Pho Ga!!! love love love."
"Chicago Diner is the place to go if you crave vegan comfort food. The mac and cheese and milk shakes are the BEST! You should expect a wait if you go on a weekend but it is well worth it! ��very relaxed, young atmosphere."
We dined at Mastro's the other evening. ��All I have to say is that it was one of the single most amazing dining experiences ever. The place looks incredible and the food is ridiculous.This place is going to to be amazing and they are going to really kill it thtere.For those of you who still eat in the viagra triangle (and FTR -- i actually don't know anybody under the age of 60 who actually still dines there) - please stay there - so you don't ruin our experience dining at Mastro'sKudos to the team at Mastros. Can't wait to go back many times
"Unfortunately for our holiday party, we were not even able to get to try the food. After making a reservation a week in advance for our holiday party, we received a call an HOUR before our reservation saying that there would be a staff training meeting during our reservation and we would be the only people in the restaurant eating while they were training the staff. All the while I was on the phone with Ryan, he kept trying to convince me that because he told me this, I should be ok with eating while they are conducting a training meeting. Thank you, Ryan. Why were we not informed when we made the reservation? Why were we not informed when we called to confirm the morning of the reservation? Why were we called ONE HOUR before we were to be seated???Susan doesn't run her restaurants like th"
"This place is the best! The service is excellent, the staff is amazing and the food is top notch. I have never had a bad experience, not once. They are great for large groups and parties."
The Guy at the bar on the weekends is friendly. The food is always satisfying! I am never tempted to go anywhere else when I go to boys town b/c the atmosphere and food is dependable.
"Be ye hereby advised that, at Tru, YOU also, and not only the food, are in the spotlight!A friend came through town and invited me along to Tru, where he had previously dined. ?He promised me that this would be an ultimate experience. ?He was right.The dinner price was $140 -- apiece -- wine extra -- tab was $210 apiece, incl tax and tip.It was like being part of a play. ?We were first motioned to a table. When we got there, two separate waiters stepped over and each helped us with the chair.Whenever we were served, which was quite often, two separate servers came, each taking care of one of us. ?They set everything in front of us in exactly the same way at the same time but from different angles. ?They would swoop in from completely separate directions to refill our water, etc. at exactly"
"I dont even know what I ordered when I went here the one time I did, but I continued to order. ��Never have I seen such a huge and delectible menu. ��I could not stop ordering more sushi once I ate what I had. ��Ended up spending like $50 dollars on me alone and I felt like a glutton, but I was like a kid on christmas morning who could not stop unwrapping."
One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. If you're going to do a churrascaria this is the place to come. There are others in Chicago but don't waste your time. You'll pay about the same and the food and service will not measure up to Fogo. Love it.
I went to Nana's for brunch on Friday mid-morning and had an excellent experience! ��I requested a table outside for a party of 5 and Nana herself was very accomodating. The servers were attentive and the food was delicious. ��I would definitely go back soon for the Nanadict. ��All the juices were freshly squeezed. ��Note to Nana: ��We need mimosa's on the morning menu please. ;)
"The Third Coast is home for me and my friends. ��We have met here so many times. ��I think we usually say we are meeting for coffee, but we always have a meal. �� The coffee is good. ��The roasted carrot soup is fantastic! �� The breakfasts are excellent. ��Some people are saying the prices are high, but to me, they seem as low as you are going to find in a regular restaurant. ��Most of the meals are in the $10 to $15 range and well worth it. ��I have been here so many times, I cannot imagine not having this place to go to. ��It is our automatic go-to spot. ��It is good for adults. ��I would not recommend it for people with kids. ��It is not that kind of place. ��It is good for meeting and talking or going by yourself and thinking or something. �� To me, it is just a perfect place all -around. ��Great mu"
"Good foodDont sell beer or wine but the cool thing is that they let you bring in your own drinks off the street. I brought in my own six pack of beer,The meat sampler was very juicy and flavorful.The hummus was yummy. The bread was good .The outside patio and great view of the street and the weather was great."
"I don't know how this place could be called a gastropub. Sure the menu reads well, and sounds pretty, but when the food comes, man what a let down. First off, the server came to take our drink order, and I asked if they had Knob Creek, (yeah, I'm a girl who likes her whiskey) the server replied no, we don't carry that on tap. Ok, go check then. The appetizers came out and the wings were just ok, but the entrees came out (35 min later) and what a let down. Soggy bread, and bland sauce. Oscar would be ashamed."
"Great food. Went there (group of 7) to celebrate a friend's birthday. We had two wait staff. The male staff seemed better at taking the food orders, etc. I am not sure that the waitress always understood what we were trying to order. I felt like there was a language barrier. But otherwise, we all had a great time. The live music, the drinks, the ambiance....all were wonderful. The owner came to the table a few times and was very attentive. Before we left, he offered us a complimentary drink. Great attention to detail. We are already planning to come back. See you guys on May 16."
"When's the last time you had a handwritten note from the owner wondering how you are included with your delivery order? ��Tuan, you are such a sweetheart and I'm so sad my best friend who I always came in there with moved away and i don't get to come in as often. ��If only every business had such delightful customer service.It was yet another delicious meal from Simply It. ��The Beef Pho soup is the greatest!! ��Tons of tenderloin and perfect flavors and I'm on my 3rd serving of it. ��The bamboo duck will always be my favorite and it was awesome as always. ��Thank you!!"
"I love going to eat here, however I would avoid it during weekend holidays, as it always gets super filled, and the wait to enter is nearly an hour or longer. The food is delicious however. I absolutely love the house special, as well as the fillet mignon, but the one that is not wrapped in bacon. If you haven't been here, you definitely try it, as it is delicious, and for the ��price, you can eat all the meat you want, and the quality is stupendous."
"I saw a ghost today. I came here for lunch with a long-time fan of Big Jones and fellow southerner from across the panhandle. I was blown away.The ghost I saw was my Grandmother, because the lunch I had really took me back to the holidays and summers I spent at my Grandparent's in Savannah when I was a kid. I swear the cornbread was all hominy flour because it doesn't get that delicate and crumbly when there's wheat flour in it. I seriously haven't had cornbread like that in years, not at all sweet (that's what honey and jam are for) and totally soft and delicate like cake, more so than bread.I had the oyster stew special, and their take was more New Orleans (my friend thought it was spot-on) but what took me back was the supremely fresh taste of the oysters simmered in cream with salt por"
"This ""trendy"" place will go out of business for the usual reasons:Over hyped food. Extremely loud and uncomfortable atmosphere.Rude Host staff.Overpriced drinks $7.00 for a soda!Sushi that does not stack up to that prepared by authentic Japanese Chefs.The food was ok- maybe even good, but not to put up with the throngs of 30 something wannabees."
Wonderful breakfast! ��Huevos Rancheros was absolutely delicious. ��I asked for soft scrambled eggs and they came out perfectly. ��Pancakes were light and fluffy and not too sweet. ��Everything came out hot. Will definitely make it out here again.The other great thing is there is a lot of street parking.
"The drink specials this Sunday night were great, and the bartender was nice. I would say I had a nice time, but not fantastic. I couldn't get over the idea that it felt like a rich grandpa's ski lodge or something, and with barely any people in there and Gaga blasting on the speakers, everyone in my group agreed that the place was a little awkward."
"Nana is a great addition to the Bridgeport neighborhood! With its ��organic concept, this family owned restaurant is a great weekend brunch location for Bridgeport residents and beyond. I do hope that more restaurants and cafes of this nature will follow suit; the neighborhood could use some updating!"
"Let me say that the ""haters"" can stay home... take it for what it is, and don't deconstruct what they are trying to do at Graham Elliot!As I told the manger on Sat night, ""Your staff are charming and nice. The food is exquisite. The prices are fair, and the ambiance is awesome. ��I just don't know what else you can do right.""If you are considering going to Graham Elliot, just go, enjoy it, don't let the hype ruin this fantastic dining experience. It really is unique!High lights:- Cheese its on top of my risotto- A waiter showing me where the restroom was (weird-but a nice touch; most people point in a general direction, not what you want if your drink is $6)- Sat us right away, with seating options- Excited, and entertaining staff- Amazing food- Great music- I didn't feel alone wearing my C"
This place was great! We came on a Friday night after purchasing a Living Social Deal. The place wasn't too crowded and it had a nice intimate feel to it. Live jazz music filled the room and served as wonderful ambiance. We each ordered an entree and the staff was very polite. The owner came over and offered us a free appetizer because he thought the wait for out entrees was taking too long. The food was great and everyone was so friendly. This is a great date night place--a bit pricey but the rest of the evening helped us forget this!
"Go here, you'll love it. ��Food was excellent, convo was a little loud at times, and the waiter needed to quit hovering, but overall really fresh, flavorful, and delicious. Get the octopus. Ok, and the risotto. The smaller serving is plenty."
I always love this place. ��It's comfort food like the ribs or great Italian pasta dishes. ��My family likes to go there for special occasions. And they have a parking lot!!! Makes going to Andersonville easier.
"This must be what HEAVEN tastes like! This place is amazing on so many levels! Im not sure if it gets any better, if it does, I havent found it!"
"One reviewer already called it italian tapas - portions not as small, but still need to order at least three. Crispy Pork Belly - was worth driving all the way from Delaware - two thin long pieces of pork with fat - crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside.Truffle egg toast - whole egg (almost poached) in the piece of bread. Didn't really taste any truffle, but still good. Our waiter was very nice. There are high top tables on one side and regular tables on the other side."
LOVE this place. ��Such great pizza. ��It's so good that they have to be usuing Crack as the main ingredient.
Absolutely outstanding brunch. ��My company gave me some Xmas money to spend on holiday food for the family - we don't get out often but heard good things about shaws - it was rediculously great. ��Can't recommend it enough - we'll be back for sure.
"Really delicious. I had the Peter Parker roll, which was amazing. Fantastic atmosphere. There's a weird kitschy bar next to it. Some very good looking hosts, too!"
"Delicious brunch offerings! ��Very crowded when I was there with 2 friends at noon on a Sunday. ��Impressed that we were called right away for a table to be seated--yet the place was packed. ��Not so impressed when we were sitting across from the grill--2 of us were hacking and wheezing for the next day from all the nasty grease inhallents--as well as smelling like the kitchen the rest of the day. ��Loved the food offerings and everything we tried. ��Tea-$6 not worth it. Ambieance nice. Tight spaces. ��But the food was great--omelettes, hash, pastries, & the toast was the best I've had in decades!"
I had a family style dinner with my cousins from out of town who wanted to have really great Greek food and my first thought was Greek Islands and they did not disappoint. ��Everyone was happy and full with the food. ��I ordered the avgolemono soup and it was just like my grandma would make it. You can go with a big group small group or just on a date. Great Place OPA!
"First visit 2 weeks ago, it was fantastic! ��We sat outdoors and it to be the most perfect intimate setting for Italian fare. ��I'm a huge fan of gnocchi and they nailed it. ��Her risotto was also perfect. ��Prices are fair, service is outstanding."
absolutely delish.......cant wait for more of that red velvet cake-its what dreams are made of. the dinner was good too !
"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. ��As an ex-South Looper, I started to get used to less-than-stellar service. ��After visiting my boyfriend's sister in Lincoln Park, we were told to go to Mayan Palace for great Mexican food and even better margaritas! ��And was she right! ��The food is absolutely delicious, and the service is superb. ��I have never gotten better service from any other restaurant in the city. ��They were also very accommodating when we called for reservations the day of New Years Eve with a group of 10. ��I've even taken my parents (who hate visiting the city and trying new things), and they absolutely rave about it! ��Now that we live in Lincoln Park, Mayan Palace is just down the street (which is a good and bad thing!)And did I mention their 1/2-off margaritas on"
"This place sounds different and very intriguing but it's missing a huge part of what is mandatory for a great dining and drinking establishment. ?This is about the customer. ?I visited the Violet Hour last night and experienced several different reactions. ?At first, the place was difficult to find and obviously designed to be that way with the speak easy concept. ?The boarded up entry is I'm guessing the way to stand out so I was curious. ?As we entered the place it had a very nice feel. ?Nice dcor, nice music, and a bit dark. ?So far, so good. ?We met up with the rest of the party for a total of nine and all was good. ?Cocktails were order and despite claiming a full bar, the selection of liquors was somewhat limited. ?I have read other opinions about the prices but not too bad for the c"
"This is the worst restaurant ever. I cant even call it a restaurant. I was there a couple of times, and there were new waitresses each time. And none of them could understand English, so it was very difficult for us to make orders. It got even worse when the owner showed up. He tried to be a funny guy, but just looked stupid. He was blaming waitresses for his own mistakes. I felt sorry for a girl when he started to yell at her in a kitchen, but we still could hear everything. No wonder girls don't stay there for a long time, no one can work for this jerk. The American cuisine was OK, but Romanian food could be better. After 10 pm a few more customers came. I figured out they were friends with the owner, cause he sat with them at the table. Soon guys were drunk and started to behave inappro"
Thank you for sponsoring the RNBA Holiday Soiree! We understand that there are many organizations that you can support and we are extremely grateful that you chose to support RNBA.Our event would not be the same without you!
"Took my wife here for her birthday dinner, the food was GREAT, but our server was average at best. ��We each had a house salad to start, I had the filet, she had the petite filet and we split an order of the Au Gratin Potatoes. ��GREAT filets, very tender and seasoned perfectly.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that our server was very unattentive and seemed very inexperienced. ��When my wife asked him for a wine pairing with a certain dish, he had no clue.With that said, solid dining experience!!"
The Hopleaf Bar - so great! When did this secret get out? Now it's hard to find any room in there ...
"The food is Ok, not great. It does not live up to its fame. The service is bad. The waiters clearly do not want to serve customers. We've been there once as a family. Do not wish to go back again."
"I recently went to Geja's for an anniversary dinner with my boyfriend and we had a wonderful time. The atmosphere was cozy and romantic and the service was friendly. We each got the Prince Geja's Combination which was the perfect choice, because it came with a salad, cheese fondue, chocolate dessert fondue and the assortment of meats to cook. Geja's really felt like a complete dining experience and everything was extremely delicious. I highly recommend this place for a romantic dinner!"
"One of the best places out there. Try a shake when you order. I put together a chocolate&banana shake with soy, and it was wonderful. Also, try the sandwiches. I had never had a central american sandwich before, and they are great. Good prices too. It will really fill you up for only a couple bucks. Delivery is fast, and they do not rely on a delivery service. Please remember to compensate the driver fairly if the weather is poor."
"I came here on Tuesday night and got the half price margaritas. It was ok, not as good as what i have read!"
This place is so good. My neighbors recommended it and I have been addicted ever since. Its a bit cramped but the staff is very friendly and will give you honest opinions on what they recommend. Its ��tough call between this and Sushi Lux as to who wins my hears for sushi... a really though call.
"Ok, this is THE BEST pizza in the world! I fell in love with this pizza a long time ago, but fell in love again when I recently visited. The pizza does take a long time(about 45 minutes) to actually get to your table, but well worth the wait. The tomato sauce is on top of the thick layer of cheese that covers the amazing buttery crust underneath. The slices are pretty big and thick, so keep that in mind when ordering a large pizza for just two. The service is generally pretty good, but once you get your pizza you will forget about anything else. There are a lot of locations in Illinois and then a few in Orlando, so if you are going to Disney make sure you check this scrumptious pizza joint out."
One of Chicago's best new restaurants!
Good Food. ��The service is okay but overall its a nice restaurant.
"Went with a group of friends and as a big eater didn't expect to be filled by small plates. However, each plate was delicious and well worth the trip. Got to try some amazing new foods like bone marrow and octopus that I never thought I would like. Would definitely return as the first dish was just as good as the last."
"I currently live in Austin, Texas and when I know that someone is going to Chicago the #1 place I tell them to go is Nuevo Leon in the Pilsen area. Best Mexican food ever!!!!!!!!!!!! Every time I go I don't know what to order. So if you're ever in town stop by Nuevo Leon.."
"So I left the attached review on 11/19/2011 but it got taken down for no apparent reason and without any notice. I have heard http://Yelp.com is a scam and the reviews are very biased but I never really thought much about it. Now I know its true. I will never use Yelp again or believe any of the comments in here. No wonder this horrible restaurant manages to have such a good rating. Americans, beware!! They will cheat with the food you eat!! I'm a Korean born immigrant living in Chicago and I took a couple of my friends out to this place because I wanted to give them some ""taste of Korea."" ��The experience was absolutely horrible. The servers were so rude they refused to greet us or even answer our questions properly; they didn't even look at us in the eye! We sat down and ordered some Galb"
"Would love to go to this place more often. Incredible unique pizza styles, like clam pizza with white sauce. And swell microbrews like baron von awesome"
"As much as I would love to try other places, something about Uncommon Ground draws me back again and again.I have never been disappointed. ��How could I be? ��The place is amazing! ��A bowl of sweet potato fries, and what could be bad?Try the bacon wrapped meatlof (enough for 2) and tell me you won't be back!YUM!"
Opart Thai has by far the best Masuman Curry I have ever tasted! My boyfriend also thoroughly enjoys their Pad Krow Prow and their squid salad is wonderful!! The service has always been descent and friendly and the atmosphere is very comfortable and beautiful! We are able to have 2 meals and an appetizer for under $25. I highly recommend Opart!!!
"Just tried something new at Fogo- po de queijo, warm cheesebread to accompany the rib eye i ordered. Best choice yet!"
"I'm a big fan of pho and I've eaten at many places. This place yet to be the best in Chicago. I love how when I first entered the door, I could smell deep aura of pho. Their pho is pretty salty which I do like and all asians like because we eat saltier food than any other ethnicities. All in all, I would prefer it less salty because not all customers like it salty and they rather would add in some hoisin or sirarcha sauce in it. I've also tried another place that actually tops pho tang's noodle soup.So I would rate this a two because I've experienced a bettter place that is well rounded on every dish not just only pho."
"Love it, love it, love it! I just moved to the Wicker Park neighborhood after living in Lake Merritt Oakland for two years, and was very spoiled on fresh veggies and high quality food. Needless to say, I feel like Milk and Honey has a very Bay Area feel to it. I have to admit I have eaten here 3 time in the last month. ��The sandwiches are awesome, and are served with homemade (i think) chips and a spiced pickle spear. The breakfast is incredible too. The prices are right for the quality food you get."
"Best date night BBQ in the city! Huge portions, great ambiance. ��You get a date night space and service and still your good old BBQ, sauce selections included, not in plastic ramekins of course.The service is always stellar, however, they always seem a bit over staffed, could be I am there at off hours as I live a block away.Can't say enough about the food, everything is great, best key lime pie in the city. ��Take your lady friend, enjoy the leftovers in the morning."
"Great food, great service. I have visited Nana for lunch, dinner, breakfast...never had a bad meal. Service is usually very attentive, and the parking is usually very good, plenty of metered spots are usually available. I am a vegetarian, and they are very accomodating when it comes to making substitutions, ie subbing veggie soyrizo for meat in several dishes.Highly recommended!"
"Alright so I tried this spot for dinner back on a Friday for a girls night out. ��I was at this spot several weeks prior for drinks with former colleagues on a weekday--a big difference. ��Both experiences were great!The first time for drinks I went during an after work weekday. The drinks are prepared good, and not as costly as one would think. ��It was packed for Wednesday, but not as packed as the Friday I came back here for dinner. ��Anyway, after finally getting to the rooftop, although the view is obstructed by other buildings nearby, because of the weather and atmosphere, you really couldn't tell. ��I tried the flight of wines, and specialty sangria, which is delicious. ��Because we were only there for drinks, we left to a local place for bad food. Second experience was for dinner on a Fr"
"I went there with my boyfriend for our one-year anniversary and it was actually quite a lovely place. The food is good but a little to meaty for my taste, I enjoyed the salad bar. The price is very reasonable ($50 per person) and I absolutely adored their Sangria! The staff was great though and never failed to answer our requests! Definitely recommending this place to friends."
"I unfortunately had a reservation which I had to put a credit card number down for and have a 48 hour window to cancel. ��That part does not bother me. ��What bothers me is that when I needed to cancel, NO ONE answered their phones for about a week and their mailbox was full. ��When I finally got through the day before my reservations, the guy on the phone was extremely rude. ��I do not understand how a restaurant can be in business when they do not answer their phones; their ��voice box is full; and by canceling reservations last minute. ��I will not ever go there!"
"Absolutely one of the Chicagoland's classic hotdog spot, THE BEST Beef dog i've ever tried. ��Great widow sit facing the street. ��Love the 60s setting."
"Great place, great service, i will be back!"
"Alliance has great coffee and super yummy treats! ��Their spinach quiche is delicious! I love to go here, sit outside and read a book or people watch."
The best pizza around!
"Always a favorite of mine! We are so lucky in Chicago to have this location and layout, the one in LA is nowhere as nice and it's so small. Love the good and love the staff! Attentive service and succulent cuts of meat!"
"A few co-workers had invited me and a friend out to Calo ?dinner. I had never been there or even heard of this place. I am a chef wanna be and specialize in Italian. I'm a believer of you can judge a restaurant (Italian) by their calamari and veal parmigiana. I couldn't find the veal on the menu!!! I asked our server and was told they do have it. WHEW! I ordered the calamari both ways. Oh my god it was fantastic! I would say the best I have ever had. Tender and flavorful to say the least. With very high expectations, I was waiting for the veal to arrive. When I cut into it and took my first bite, I was in Italian heaven. It too was the best I have ever had! I told the server it was amazing, the best. She smiled and said I knew you would love it The only downside of the whole experience is "
"Great Wine, Real Good Food, Awesome Cheese, lots of great looking people. ��The service is good too. They are leaders in the wine world of Chicago but don't take themselves so seriously - They have a BBQ and Bingo game coming in August, I just bought tickets for this! ��Sounds like a blast."
"superdawgs is super overpriced. I didn't even like the hot dog. If you want a true chicago style hot dog, I would go to either jimmy's or gene and jude's. They top superdawg by far"
"Great dogs, what moe can a fella say? ��If you don't want to wait, go somewhere else dumb dumb."
"I was there last week, let me tell you that the food and the service were both exceptional. Really nice restaurant with good food, and as I said before...exceptional service. You need to be red meat eater to truely appreciate this restaurant. They are good for large parties and I recommend that you have reservations, we did and we were seated immediately. The salad bar was ample but seemed to be missing some small things, sorry if mentally I sometimes compare salad bars to Zed's Harvest bar. The service was extremely attentive and friendly, but the meats, poultry and sausage were why I was there, and they were great, and filling which is nice because there were people in our party obviously had they different preferences between the ��beef, chicken, and pork. I'll be back."
"I really liked this place! The service was very good and the food was really fresh and tasty. I went for brunch and the selection of dishes was very diverse. I had a hard time choosing between the chiliquiles and the pumpkin ravioli. Very good place to eat. My only beef with it is the location. Edgewater might as well be a suburb it is so far from the west side of Chicago. If you are north, you should go here a lot. If you are south or west, make a trip at least once.....it's well worth it."
"I can't lie - I love their mussels. ��I really do. ��And Belgian style is just... no words. ��That good. ��Plus, their fries are out of this world and pair perfectly with beer (then again, what doesn't?)"
"Amazing!The owner was incredibly nice and patient with our big group of BYOB'ers. �� It's more healty and fresh than the Argyle St alternatives. I had the beef lemongrass app as my main and it was plenty of food. Other people in the group got claypots, pho, spring rolls and beef dishes and everyone was very happy with the food."
I loved the brazilian charbroiled chicken!
"I have eaten here twice. ��The first time, I had some kind of vegan stir-fry(for those that don't know at this point, it is a restaurant with vegetarian and vegan offerings; no meat). ��The second time, I had the fajitas. ��I'll keep this review short: everything I've had was bland at best and highly overpriced(taste to cost ratio). ��If it were not for the vegan peanut butter supershakes, or blueberry smoothies(yummy!) and their other varieties, this place would cease to be on my radar. ��Although... I would probably go back again; after all it was not awful and it feels good to be in a place that doesn't serve up the flesh with vegetarian dishes as just an aside. ��If they could infuse a little more love and spice into their foods, I would say that this place would be THE go-to restaurant for "
"This used to be our favorite - for truly special occasions. For years it was wonderful in all respects. Alas, it has fallen WAY DOWN - now it is just very expensive with only o k food. There are too many places close by that are much better. We won't be back."
"First of all, it's a little pretentious and pricey. It looks like a dive on the outside, it's kind of cold, and not a whole lot of smiles.BUT the drink menu is one of the most creative I have ever experienced. The decor is classic and beautiful. No cell phones, so turn it on vibrate.It's nice to see something like this in Chicago, it may not be for everyone but it is definitely unique."
"The poetry slams on Sundays guarantees an awesome time! ��Every slam is different and original in its own way! At yesterday's they had a band from New Orleans with some members in full Mardi Gras Atire. ��The decor inside makes you feel like you are stepping back in time into another era. ��At only $6, this definitely has to be the best value for live entertainment in the city! ��The Green Mill is a bastion of originality, urban culture, and personality!"
"food is great and service is exceptional. ��the owner and waitstaff are very friendly and the place is actually affordable. ��it reminds me of a nyc byob restaurant. ��bathrooms are clean, too...even the mens :-)"
"Never I my life have a been to such a pretentious restaurant with a wait staff to match. ��The waiter (who said he was the assistant manager) was rude and even though they took the reservation knowing that members of the party had food allergies, he refused to make the dishes according to those needs. ��In fact he told us quite obnoxiously ""he would be happy to make us a reservation at another restaurant"". To everyone who will listen....DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!!!"
One my favorite italian restaurants in Chicago! I always seem to get the butternut squash ravioli! I heard about this place for years and finally checked it out. Its nice that they send out those coupons every once in awhile.
"I ordered delivery from here last night! it was the best, some great foods for my vegetarian diet.Avocado wontons, veggie eggrolls, vegetarian's delite and some pumpkin soup all made my night. But there's more! I walked in for lunch today on my hour off and it was the best value I have ever found in Chicago. Soup, salad, hot tea, and tilipia entree. under 10 bucks, amazing how do they do that?Simply it, is just simply the best value, tasting and FIERCE!"
"My boss took me to Kinzie Chop House for my 90 day review, and ALL went well. ��Our server , Stephen,was attentive but never oppressive, my Martini was unparralleled and was moved to a frosty new glass about half way through. ��Yay! ��Tuna Tartar. ��In a steak house? ��Exceedingly satisfying and I was a little sorry it was over. ��A PERFECTLY Medium Well Filet with recommended bacon/scallion mash and parmesan creamed spinach that forced me to over eat because there was just no way to leave a morsel. ��Bring on the Creme Brulee. ��I am an aficionado, and though not MY perfect one, it was Stellar none the less. ��Thanks, Boss!"
"I went here with my sister a little while ago, and it was really good.My sister got the lentil soup and hummus, and I got a lamb shewarma. ��She really enjoyed both items, and we had enough hummus to take home. ��The only complaint I have about the shewarma is that it was very, very messy. �� I didn't really mind cuz it was hella good! ;D"
"Great place; wish I would have been there more than once while living in Chicago, but Chi-Town has too many places to choose from."
"This is high art gastronomy. An experience, not just sustenance.Service impeccable. Each dish perfection. Atmosphere is as you would expect for the now 3 Michelin starred restaurant. Not as fussy as I thought it would be, but still a little stiff. Not a major criticism. More a personal preference for something a little more casual and laidback. But hey, this is one of the best restaurants in the world, and people expect certain airs and graces.A major highlight for me was the dessert served at, or should I say, on, the table. Performance and flavour was sweeeet.Oh, and save your pennies for this one. As you can expect, a once in a lifetime meal comes with a once in a lifetime price tag."
"The occasion: our 10-year anniversary. The destination: the one, the only, the legendary Alinea. The company: our friends, first-rate foodies who were looking for the right excuse.We were shown to a nice table surrounded by four comfortable chairs. As soon as we sat, a cartoon-like time-shift occurred: we slowed down while the staff around us went into a frenzy. They simply had no time. While I was in mid-sentence, they stepped in, placed a dish, explained the dish, and disappeared. All within a blink of an eye. We were left dumb-founded. Where did these dishes come from? What were the secret ingredients? How were they used? So many questions unanswered.The process repeated again and again. Dishes presented in haste. Explanations mumbled. Wine, seemingly unrelated to the food, was poured w"
"Never skip on: Brazilian cheese bread, Lobster Bisque Soup, Garlic Mashed potatoes, Picahna, and Flank steak. Cons: our waiter was extremely slow and not helpful. HOWEVER, I loved the meat so 5 stars anyway."
Was there a couple weeks ago with my wife.Food is just out of this world. Service is excellent.A little pricey but worth it.
"Yummy Horchata and enormous portions! ��Friendly staff and though they are always packed, they get us in and we enjoy our meals!"
"This place was a vegan paradise. ��Chickpeas and lentils and beets, Oh My! ��So many different ��flavors and textures all eaten with delicious injera (sourdough flatbread). ��Start with the Sambusas, trust me, they are life changing."
"Alliance is fabulous. ��They made our wedding cake - and it was PERFECT. ��I've never been to a wedding before where people actually enjoy the cake - and I'm still hearing about how delish it was. ��Peter was very easy to work with - as was the designer. ��Cake tasting was fun and delicious - they delivered the cake to the reception on time, and in perfect condition. ��Best part about Alliance is that when we got back to our honeymoon suite, there were cookies and a gift certificate in our room from them for our 1 year anniversary cake. ��If you're looking for a wedding cake baker - definitely try out Alliance!"
"11/23/2011. ��I am compelled to leave this review because I have been a customer to this establishment and I even invited my colleagues to sample some sze chuan cuisine which he liked very much but the service was so horrendous, discourteous and lousy. ��Even after reminded the staff that we have completed one dish without the rice; the second dish did not come out until 20 to 25 minutes later after a few reminders to the staff. ��The second dish came about 40 minutes from the first dish; so you can imagine our disappointment. ��The rice only came when we were about half way through the second dish. ��What upsets us was that the staff does not even show any urgency or apologize for the service. ��As for one that would normally not leave a tip; we are leaving this review to the owner as our tip. "
"Excellent experience! ��The ambience is perfect from the moment you walk in. ��The waitress was very knowledgeable and made great suggestions. ��We ordered the most delicious seafood pasta and the gnocchi was out of this world. ��It's small, intimate and very cozy. ��Great Valentine's Day pick!"
"We grabbed some pizzas yesterday for our day long FOOTBALL FEST.Just awesome!!!!! �� ��We did the Baltimore with lots of crabmeat and Bay Seasoning and a Supreme...Lots of toppings on both. Delivered on time, (about an hour is what they said, came about 50 minutes). �� Driver was cool, not the normal type that don't say hello...Our Favorite pizza place by far..Grabbed the Garlic Knots(big twisty garlic bread things)..They rocked too...along with Bocci Knots, or balls..I forget..Meatball things wrapped in dough and served with fresh marinara dipping sauces...YUM."
Great neighborhood restaurant. ��I love going Mon-Thurs for the ribs special. ��You can't beat it: prices are reasonable and it comes with a salad. ��They also do a great job with delivery.
"Been going for years. ��Went last weekend and the food was horrible. ��Their new spit-barbecued pork gyro was dry and the meat was burned. ��The combo Moussaka and lamb I had was sub-par, runny Moussaka and about 5 thin slices of leg o' lamb, probably not more than 2 1/2 ounces. ��13 smackeroos for that. ��VERY disappointing. ��Waiter was OCD . . . Next time, I'm trying one of the others."
"I used to live in Chicago and remember 8 years ago when Pequod's was a hole-in-the-wall with plastic tables, no ambience, very good service, and outstanding, very unique deep-dish pizza. ��Things have changed a lot. ��I recently returned to Chicago with 3 buddies for a cubs game and I was looking forward to Pequod's. ��Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations.We were told the wait for a table was 25 minutes. ��It took over an hour. ��We bid our time at the (small) bar and despite complaining about the wait, were not offered any prizes at the bar as is usually the custom at a restaurant where the wait is much longer than promised (IE no free drinks).We ordered deep dish pizza (of course) and ��some wings for ��appetizers. ��The wings came after the pizza and weren't very good anyway. ��And I f"
Way over cooked burger. Big salad bar but over priced.
"So you're down on the mag mile, checking out the usual shops, spots and tourist traps, when suddenly you belly tells you that it's time for you to catch a bite. There's absolutely NO better place to grab some grub downtown, than Grand Lux. Whether a romantic date, a business 'thing', hanging with friends, or entertaining out-of-towners, Grand Lux is the answer.It's fairly hip, pseudo-upscale, ��but affordable, and relaxed. There's a great wine list, and the pasta dishes are f**king amazing. The wait for a table isn't too bad, even on ""on-nights"" like Fridays and Saturdays (the longest I've had to wait was like twenty minutes). The staff is courteous, quick, and knowledgeable about the menu, and the valets get your car back to you fast when you're done. The only downside to the restaurant ��i"
"My family grew up on Calo's Pizza. Their Pizza's are made as if we were visiting Italy for the first time. ?They arive at your door, pretty much after they hang up the phone. ?The doorbell rings and all you can say is, That was fast. And, it's hot. The pizza, any way you want it, is magnificent. But, that baked mostaccioli, in meat sauce, with extra mozzarella baked on top...YUMMY! ?It's terrific for any night.We also love La Villa. We chose to go there last Sunday night, completely unaware, that Channel 11 did a Check Please segment on them. We arrived to what seemed to me, was the place to be, when we saw it was jam packed, in the waiting area but, the Hostess was fast, getting everyone a table and making sure we were comfortable. It's such a romantic restaurant, that just like in Italy,"
"Following the advice of others I went to try out Le Colonial. I remembered seeing a little spot they had in their SF location on the Foodie Channel. Good stuff. I had the prixe fixe lunch - pho, chicken cari, and ice coffee. the pho was amazing, I havent tasted authentic pho like that since actually being there in HCMC. The chicken was great too, tasted authentic and stuff. the only thing that was bad was their ca phe sua da. it was weak and on the yucky side. i expected a lot more. service was awesome. there were like 50 waitstaff and bus people there or so it seemed. great stuff, would definitely hit that place up again."
"The olive bread is excellent. ��Very clean and excellent selection. The bakers were really niceHowever, the cash register lady with blond slick back hair was really rude to the customer ahead of me and had no training in welcoming a customer. �� No hello, smile, or thanks. ��I think she was even a supervisor so I couldn't ��say anything . ��Maybe she was pissed bc her workers had not showed up (8am) so she had to take of the cash register or it was too early for her. �� �� Customer hospitality must be priority for any store to succeed! ��Too bad I had to give Fox and Obel 3 stars"
The fish tacos were bad mainly due terrible tortillas.
love love love this place. so many options for vegetarians even for a vegetarian place. i love the desserts and the no meata fajitas are great. brunch is a little chaotic...but livable. my only complaint would be that it seems a little pricey sometimes for what you get...
"This falls into the bucket of ""never go again."" The spread looked amazing and the food itself tasted good...at the time. However, I was sick for two days with a horrible bout of food poisoning after dining here. I typically hesitate to blame restaurants for food poisoning but I am certain my illness was a direct result of the restaurant because I had only eaten home-cooked food the prior two days before eating here and had the same stuff when I was back to 100% afterwards. Looking back, I do recall being grossed out that the server who sliced some turkey breast for me proceeded to ""sauce"" my plate with cranberry sauce and stuck the knife back into his container after touching my dirty plate. I imagine doing that 100 or so times will cross contaminate.* from my visit on 12/18/2011"
"We were a group of three couples. Most of us were ?South Asians except one white woman married to one of us. We are all in our seventies and ?are highly successful professionals of repute.I read a review by Cynthia Y from San Francisco. She thought ?that a patronizing behavior of the staff was due to their young age and felt it (again, Asian thing). Here I personally felt it too at least initially. ?I have become good at noticing such behavior when dealt by salesmen, ?waiters and management in a fancy restaurants or even when shopping for an expensive car. It is as if he (mostly men do it.) thinks that I can not really afford such luxury and am being a nuisense.Cynthea V has described this feeling well and I will not repeat it.The waiters and the staff at Alinea were a little stiff, offici"
"Canyou say delicous. When i wen to HOt Doug this weekend the first thing I though was who would pay $7 dollars for a regualr size hot dog, but when I saw the menu it had a variety of different hot dogs and choices you could choose from. The service was very very slow here but I believe every second was worth the wait! The people here were really nice and you felt like you were in a nice enviormnt even though lines were out the door. The store does not look that appelaing when you first look at it, but I can surely say the food really backs it up. I would more than likely go back becasue I can honestly say the food was delicous!"
"BEST DEEP DISH PIZZA IN ALL OF CHICAGO! Yep, I said it and you CANNOT, WILL NOT convince me of otherwise. I don't mind the wait because it's THAT delicious. I love the caramelized cheese crust the best! The sauce is delicious and the variety of toppings are endless. It's just plain orgasmic. They have a great selection of quality beers on tap also, as well as, some tasty apps. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I take all my visitors there when they say that want Chicago deep dish, and anytime I am in the mood for deep dish pizza, I look nowhere else, but here."
"We have been going here since they opened on Clybourn. The food has been pretty good, the price is right and the location is convenient. This evening I ordered via their website and when I showed up to pick-up our dinner they had no record of the order...until they looked at the printer under the cash register. Upon finding the missing order they proclaimed that the their website 'sucks' and I should phone my order and never use the online system and besides they were out of the grouper soup and did not have the chicken tamal that was on our printed order. Basically I was being told that their service failure was my fault for ordering online and ordering two items they were out of...very nice...wtf? They are always out of the grouper soup and should take it off of the menu. The two sides o"
"I'm wary about giving this place too good a review - I love it so much, that if I give it I really tell people how awesome I think this place is, everyone else will start coming in droves and there'd be lines to get in going around the block on Friday evenings. Then where'd I get to go?The Third Coast is a lovely experience. The place looks like a genre painting, and the egshell white walls nicely complement the subdued lighting; the place is perfect for late night dining. I've been going to the place more or less weekly for about 2 years now, and love it. Its a favored haunt of local artists, in particular, and the place displays art of its own.The Third Coast is quiet, which is a rarity - most bars blast music from a jukebox, some drunk jerks playing ac/dc all night. Not this place - the"
"4.5 stars!(dinner review)have had dinner there several times. ?Each time it's great fun. ?Creative dishes, great atmosphere, high-end service. ?What you want in an upper-midrange experience. ?You can take the in laws there, entertain clients, go with friends. ?I have heard stories of uneven service, but we've not experienced that (quite the opposite, actually. ?ours has been top notch).It's also fun just sitting back and saying surprise me and getting anything.They're willing and able to accommodate dietary restrictions and are very attentive to them.Love the cheese sammich :)can't wait to go back!"
"Great for large parties and tiny parties and I'm-feeling-like-a-panda parties--because you'll want to eat like one, this place is a gem, aside from the inevitable smoke. Atmosphere is swell and the service is sometimes fun, sometimes business, but always serving.The pickled and otherwise assortment that begins the meal is delightful. I cannot decide if I want the tiny dishes to be labeled in some fashion. Partly, I want to know and build my language, and partly, I want no one to know.Don't put the bone on the grill. I am a cautionary tale."
"i had book a 7:30 dinner reservation and i had to wait 45 minutes before i was taking to my table, me and my date was impress with the service we received like this steak house"
"First: This is probably the best sushi you'll find in Chicago.However: Now that happy hour is over (which was half off most rolls two days a week), it's pretty expensive--up to around $15/roll for the good ones. ��They are huge, though--two of these would fill up almost anyone.That being said, if this is in your price range, go! ��The music is good, it's BYOB, and there's anime projected on the main wall. ��Oh, and order at least one ""godzilla"" and one ""red dragon"". ��They are absolute staples.EDIT: the music has become a little less awesome lately. ��bring back the tall guy's ipod!"
"OMG I love this place........ I don't think you understand how great the food is. Hands down, this is my favorite place to eat. The drinks are so good and the juice is awesome too!! my favorite plate is the salmon platter and hand cut chips. I love it!!!!!!"
"The BEST sushi restaurant!!! My favorite roll is the 'GODZILLA"" (mmmmmmm) Its a bit pricey...go during happy hour Sun-Wed 5-7 half off rolls!!!"
stuffed by the slice. ��That is heaven. ��You can't do better. ��but also everything is priced at a reasonable level. ��Go try and get a stuffed slice at philly's best and see how much it costs you.Parking is the only real hassle I see. ��B+ on thin slices too.
"Our waitress, Sandy, pushed a 4.9 meal into a 5 star event! ��I'm so happy I listened to my in-laws and enjoyed an endless meal, fabulous desert, and fancy cocktails. ��This will become a new tradition!"
"love this. just had my wisdom teeth pulled and needed pho desperately. unfortunately, nobody would drive to argyle for me, but i found this place via google, and its WONDERFUL. thick rich broth with the perfect amount of veggies and noodles. cant WAIT to try dinner. yum yum yum. they even threw in a free side of gorgeous watermelon, cantaloupe, and pineapple. big huge chunks, that were very obviously freshly cut. highly recommend."
"Way over priced! They used to send out buy one get one free coupons which made the price acceptable. Now with publicity and fame they dont have to, and they dont!The hot dogs are great and the fries are super but the price is unacceptable except at the ball park."
Third coast is fantastic! I have been hesitant to write a review for fear that it will become something different! So nice to live in a touristy neighborhood and have a locals restaurant right down the street. Excited for the Chinese chicken soup to be back now that it is fall:) On my own or with my husband what a GREAT find!
"Some of the best Steak I've ever had! Soooo good, love coming here."
an awesome place to have brunch with family and friends~one of my favsonly thing is that you will be probably sitting elbow to elbow with the table next to you....the coffee here is amazing~!!!
"amazing beer selection and good comfort food. it is impossible to go here on the weekends, and increasingly during the week it seems. i have been told that the wait for a table is an hour and a half, i mean really, really? there are only so many beers you can drink before dinner without falling over. i really enjoy the seasonal food selections. the salads are always lovely. the cb&j is the most comforting sandwich i can even imagine, i feel like one of there chefs delved into my psyche and put it on the menu."
"The way I describe this place is great ideas, good scene but poor execution.The decor, atmosphere and staff all receive top grades in my book. ��Many of the appetizers are inventive and delicious (although there are none that I thought I really would need to try again).After asking the waiter if there was any must have items on the menu he suggested the Pork Belly. ��While the first bite was good, this thing was way to salty boarding on uneatable. ��Equally disappointing were my girlfriends sushi rolls. ��While they have inventive names and some interesting ideas, none of the flavors blended well.All and all, the experience was good, just not a place I would go back to."
This place is good but not great. There really isn't anything else like it around and has a decent food selection to choose from. The only problem is that it is way over priced for what it actually is. Would I go back? No.
"My family came here for dinner on Easter Sunday, it was amazing, great food, excellent service, cool atmosphere. And the owner drove us home in a limo and sent us off with a couple bottles of wine. A great night."
"Time has made me older, and therefore, more bitter. ��Knocking you down to one star, Bongo Room. ��Boo! ��One day you'll learn that customer service matters."
"Such a disappointment!! ��I ordered my baby's 1st birthday cake from here after all the reviews I saw and the cakes I saw in the store..I spoke to this guy Peter for 30mins explaining about the design and sent him pictures of other cake designs for reference. He gave me an estimate of $200 for it. I wanted a garden theme fondant cake with butterflies and flowers on it in hotpink, limegreen girly colors. But when I got the cake, I was so disappointed by the way it looked. It was pale and boring. There was no fondant. instead had icing and some lame design that probably I can design on my own. It was such a disappointment. But one good thing was that the cake tasted good and he charged me $120 instead. But I would have been OK if he had charged me even a little more but made the cake I wanted"
"I think XOCO's food is great; however, I didn't feel like the amount of food justified the prices. For lunch, I had the tortilla soup and tamales-maybe I didn't order enough? Anyway, I'm still considering going to Topolobampo sometime, so the Bayless empire is still good by me :)"
"Went to Xoco and had the Jamon sandwich-great, but the salty aftertaste stuck with me. Brought my wife back for one of the soups-I took one sip of mine (chicken posole), and definitely didn't like it. There was some ingredient or combo of ingredients in it that left me dreading having to finish it since I had already paid for it. My wife, who is from Mexico, had the rib soup-not good either. We ordered chips with guacamole for the kids, and when the salty chips ran out, we asked for more-one of the waiters responded that we would have to go back to the cash register and pay for more! Not even the cheapest Mexican restaurants elsewhere will ask you to do this-c'mon, Rick, your patrons are shelling out big bucks, and shouldn't be hearing this! I believe Mr. Bayless knows what he is doing, an"
"I'm perplexed with the large amount of good ratings with Revolution Brewing. I'm in Logan Square a lot so I was very excited for this place. The hordes of people who descended on RevBrew wasn't a big surprise and the wait usually wasn't too bad assuming you didn't go specifically for a table during peak times. Outside of the interior, which I love, everything about this place is average. The beer, which I was looking forward to the most because I'm a beer snob, was a huge disappointment. The beers are by no means bad but they fail to distinguish themselves. The Workingman Mild tasted too watered down, the Coup d'etat started off interesting but stopped there and the Bottom Up Wit was merely passable. I must admit, however, that the Eugene porter was pretty good. When I had the RevBrew beer"
"This place can't be beat.You walk in and the atmosphere is awesome. The main entrance is like the foyer of a mansion. The waiting line is often very long but very worth it. Once you get seated, you forget about standing there as soon as the smell of the fresh bread hits your nose. The portions however are very large so order accordingly. They have great food. My favorite thing there is the chop salad which is huge so you should definitely share it. Then for the main course I really enjoy the patty melt. This patty melt is not what you normally think of, it's served on white bread with thousand island dressing. Then to finish it all off I'd go with the chocolate molten cake. Again I'd share this item because it is a very rich dessert."
Best pizza ever! Deep dish that chicago can be proud off.
"If you can appreciate a really good burger then you will absolutely enjoy this place. These burgers are insane! with interesting names like Conjugal Visit, The Electric Chair and Cruelty to Animals to name a few. They are worth every penny and if you go on a tuesday when most of the burgers are half-off you are basically robbing the place!AWESOME selection of beer (This is a paragraph in itself)!!!! Large spectrum, from PBR to Delirium Tremens.Great mac-and-cheese, you have to try it! Ok as far as the servers go. Bartenders are great and really fit well with the place. Door guy does everything from checking your ID, to seating you, to cleaning your table if he has to, and is really friendly while doing it.Very loud (it doesn't bother me too much, but i thought I should let you know)Look fo"
"Great food and service. Our waitress even offered a complimentary dessert but we were too stuffed. Lobster bisque was ok, but the oysters, crab spring rolls and shrimp ceviche were outstanding. I had the pork belly with Manila clams which was very good."
"This place is so good and the service is excellent too. The owner is very friendly and very nice. The Beef soup (Pho) is delicious and the portion is very generous as well. ��For 10 dollars, you will get a big bowl of beef soup with rice noodle, a cup of lemon ice tea and a fruit dish. Moreover, this place is BYOB too. I will come back again for sure."
This place is great! Had the serrano ham and manchego cheese plates as well as the ropa vieja appetizer and they were great!. I had the vegeteriana plate and it was amazing. The decor is awesome and staff was great - 5 stars :)
This Restaurant is more that a 5 star. It is simple one wonderfulplace to entertain clients or just simply hang out with friends for drinks. If that isn't enough try the Winter Delight Menu which givesyou a 3 course menu for $20 bucks. How great is that? If you arethinking of larger parties they even have a private dining experienceand work with you to set up all your food selections for the evening!It's as if you have a country club membership without the fees. Go Dine! You will love it!
"The food here is amazing! We typically get the lamb and the saganaki. The food is at a great price point and the ambiance of the restaurant is great- very lively and fun. The servers are friendly. However, the bussers were so annoying! They were constantly at our table just to fill up our glass of water even if I only had taken one sip out of my water glass. If there was one crumb on the table someone would come and clear it away. It's nice to have an attentive waitstaff but this was seriously obnoxious. If I was not actively chewing on something a busser would come over and ask if he could take my plate even if I had only gotten my food ten minutes earlier. At one point in time 3 different people came to the table within two minutes to try to take away my plate! Two asked me if they could"
"First of all, I was thrilled when I called here and asked what vegan options were on the menu, and the gentleman on the phone actually knew what I was talking about!! ��There are many vegan options, and the food is delicious. ��The portions are huge and the guacamole is awesome! ��Word of warning, the fried plantains are addictive. ��They put this awesome garlic sauce on them."
"Food was good, but the wait to get a table was about 30-45 minutes. Which I guess is not too bad in Lakeview on a Friday. Our waiter was really nice and attentive. The setting can be rather intimate depending on where you are seated. I was placed in the area that look like a study. The beer selection is great, they have a lot of my favorites. If I am in the area, I would go back for that alone."
Most AUTHENTIC i've been to :) ��Could be cleaner and the bathrooms should be cleaner but all in all the food is FANTASTICO!
"I was so excited to use my Geja's Groupon. Unfortunately, my three friends and I had a terrible experience at Geja's last night. We had a reservation but weren't seated until 40 minutes after our scheduled time. The space was packed and claustrophobic, the cheese fondue wasn't great (Geja's offers only one variety), and (though there was no posted notice on the menu or anywhere in the restaurant) there was a plate charge for my two friends who had come along for wine but not for food. I was embarrassed to have invited them along for such an unsatisfying experience. Next time, I'll happily take my business to the Melting Pot."
I always order Giordano's pizza.One of the best deep dish pizzas here in Chicago. The sauce is amazing with all the different spices. I always order stuffed spinach and it is amazing. They always deliver on time. They have a great dinning area. They can make pretty much any toppings for your pizza. The crust of the pizza is strong it does not fall apart when you pick it up. There are many locations all around the Chicago area.
Ok... So I finally broke down and tried it out. After all of the hype I thought that I would be disappointed. ��Ummmmm no. There's a reason why there is a line around the corner all the time. Doug has taken the hit dog to an artistic level and made some combos that you wouldn't even imagine. Even if you aren't a hot dog fan you owe it to yourself to give it a try. Maybe just wait till it warms up (for good!) since all good things come to those who wait.
MMMMMMMMMMMMM...thats all I can say
"I liked this place alot because of the food, I specially like the seoul sassy chix, seoul sensation & baby buddha.. the only thing i don't like about this place is the parking, it took us a little more than half an hour to look for a spot! other than that the place is recommendable!"
Superb burrito. ��Lots of meat and cheese. ��Absolutely one of my fave Chicago restaurants. ��Good service and the recent renovations make the place look a lot more clean and nice.
"The best! ��The ambiance, the food, the staff...my spouse and I enjoyed it all!"
"Wooo for good food! my parents, girlfriend and several roommates including myself were feeling hungry for some vietnamese. So we hit up this place on friday night and came in around the busy hour at 7. Shockingly, we were able to get a table in 15 minutes without a reservation. The man running out front got us seated and made sure our dinner was going well. We actually even got free lemonade and ice tea for waiting. What other place does this?? It was awesome! Free always tastes better!Onto the food, we were stuffed at the end of our dinner. The Barbeque Beef Short Ribs were amazing, simply it's beef, lemongrass chicken, pineapple callamari and tofu&eggplants were all great. The food came out on a timely manner which made us all happy. At the end of our meal we were given plates of sliced "
i will give five stars for the super great food!BUT negative ----100000000000000000 points forWAITRESS name ALEXA!!!!!terrible attitude horrible service. I am a very good tipper but I simply wanted to give her 0% tip.Hope she does not go into service business for her sake.
"Great BYOB place. Food is good and the service is phenomenal. They exemplify customer service -- if you order take out, they serve you tea while waiting. And there is complimentary fruit with dinner."
Best hod dog ever!! THIS IS A MUST EAT HOT DOG BEFORE DYING!
"This is my go to place when I'm craving Vietnamese and don't want to make the trek up to Argyle. I've tried a number of items on their menu and everything has been really good, I would especially recommend the beef pho and the chicken dumplings they my favs! The service is always great here and owner is super nice and sweet.Highly recommend this place!"
"Pequod's is top quality gourmet pizza. ��My mom is Sicilian, so I was raised on artisan pizza. ��At Pequod's it is all about the sauce and the crust. ��Most pizza in Chicago is a boat of cheese. ��Pequod's goes lighter with the cheese, and in my opinion gives the perfect amount. ��Their crust is crisp and flavorful (made in a cast iron skillet) and I highly recommend the mushroom.They also deliver farther west than most other pizza places on the east side.GO PEQUOD'S!"
"Really one of the best Italian restaurants in Chicago. I came here for my birthday back in May and before that, I went before Christmas. It is great. Every time I want to go out to a nice dinner for an occasion, this the place to go. The owner is from Pisa. There is a waiter from Venice or Trieste. Everybody is so nice and the food is delicious and very filling. Whether you want a cream based or tomato sauce, everything is so tasty. Try the baked Alaska for dessert. ��The interior of this place is beautiful as well. Also, I'm surprised that there are some bad reviews. The people who wrote them must not be Italian or be familiar with Italian food."
"Couldn't wait for this place to open and I am happy it is here, but after dining three times I have to admit I expected more based on all the hype.Wait time for a table has been normal, but the wait time between courses can sometimes get annoyingly pronounced. ��Some of the dishes are literally a few bites (like the less than average ravioli pasta with foam - skip it) but then you will sometimes wait for 20 minutes for the next few bites. ��Maybe they sell more drinks that way?The pub food options are solid in general, but the more adventerous options usually end up being misses, the exception being sweetbreads, but then again I love sweetbreads! ��Go with a small group and order more than you think you should eat and it works out pretty well. Will be a frequent diner based on location really"
"This is one of those great neighborhood bars in Andersonville. The beer is great, the music too (not too loud). The first time we went I had the mussels and my friend had the mac & cheese and both were surprisingly fantastic, and not just for bar food! I completely agree that the salads are underrated and really something that you have to try. Overall a great little neighborhood bar that is small but cozy at the same time."
sorry not for us
"AMAZING Eggs Benedict. Good portion size, pretty great service. Can't say enough positive things about this place. Great fruit. Polite and prompt service, and good menu variety. Way to go, Yolk."
"My beau and I had dinner at Schwa on Friday, July 1st and to say we were blown away would be an understatement. ��I am fairly traditional in my food experiences/preferences. Schwa pushed my comfort level, taste pallette, and ��food sophistication to the nth degree. It was beyond compare. The young men serving drinks, setting silver and serving and explaining our dishes were wonderful. They were humorous and well spoken when explaining each dish as they served it. ��We couldn't agree on our favorite food but the schmore dish, the rabbit and the crab dish were amazing. Thank you so much Chef Carlson and staff, for such a wonderful evening."
YEAH !!! The ladies and I went here the other night after work . It was so great ! They have amazing drinks and the atmosphere was super relaxed. The service is great . Its a super chill spot to start out the night or finish it up . I will be back Gilt bar !!! On the the next bar !!!
"Simply It was an incredible little place we found one night while strolling down Lincoln Ave in search of a great BYOB. ��Me and my girlfriends were instantly impressed by the beautiful d��cor and low lighting. ��The wait staff was all extremely friendly, helpful and very attentive. ��We had the waiter recommend a couple of dishes and they all turned out to be incredible!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Pineapple Calamari (which is served inside of a halfed pineapple) and the Jumbo Shrimp Entrees! ��This is one of those rare jem of a restaurant that turned out to be one of the best places I have been in Chicago!No corkage fee, friendly staff, good, fresh food and warming atmosphere! Will definitely be back!!"
"Last night, We planned to have dinner outside but could not able to decide where to go one of my friend suggested to go at Alinea restaurant.. then we decided to go there and We found it amazing there..... the Food & cousine was awesome N wine was so amazing... everything was upto the mark and Was a classy hotel..... Fast service and delicious food.......it was just awesome..."
I frequent this location at least once a month. ��Calamari salad and the scallops entree are phenomenal. ��I only give this establishment four because of the noise level on the last two visits.
"I came here this past weekend, and I honestly don't remember the names of the food I got (because a friend ordered it for me) but I was in love. ��I never really had Indian food before but I couldn't put down my fork!I loved the Pistachio Ice Cream."
"I wasn't impressed with the food. ��I tried this restaurant for restaurant week. ��My family is from Mississippi and I was soooo excited to try the barbeque. ��The homemade chips were good and I had the BBQ flight (pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket) as a starter. ��It came with 3 huge pieces of honey butter cornbread. ��The cornbread was good but it tasted like it was a step up from Jiffy mix. ��My boyfriend had the shrimp and lemon-infused grits as a starter. ��What a disappointment! ��I've eaten grits all my life and while these were delicious in flavor they lacked big time in texture. ��They were gritty and seemed undercooked. ��I really had to chew them. ��The bbq shrimp was really good. ��I enjoyed the BBQ flight because the meat was tender and the flavor was smoky. ��I next had the St. Loui"
"I really like Big Jones. It's the one place that I have to visit when I go to Chicago.I've always been happy with brunch - good popovers, beignets, benedict, and shrimp and grits. I've liked all of the cocktails and dinner specials. I probably wouldn't order the gumbo again- not because it wasn't good, but because it's not really what I'm looking for when I go out.The staff is always competent and friendly. The restaurant cares about what they're doing and trying to be better at what they do. I wish I could have been there for the wood fired oysters!"
"Great food, dedicated employees, neighborhood gem...And for the one who left a review questioning the authenticity, I challenge you to a duel! ��The family who runs this awesome joint are 100% Costa Rican... So what if some dishes are slightly different 2200 miles away?! ��If all restaurants prescribed to a set of recipes that doesn't change from restaurant to restaurant, then there would be only one large Japanese restaurant, one large Italian restaurant, one large Costa Rican restaurant, etc., to choose from in Chicago.I personally love it when owners switch it up a little bit to put their own flare on the menu. ��Kudos to Irazu for being AUTHENTIC in their own right!"
"Delicious food, great service. Had a salad AND a soup to start...everything was timed perfectly with everyone's entrees coming out just at the right time (was with a group of 8). Great atmosphere; and the fact that I got a $15 gift certificate in the mail shortly after my visit just puts it over the top. I have aboslutely no complaints about this place and will go back soon. The perfect venue for a date or a group of friends looking for a nice dinner out."
The wait is always long but the food is well worth it. Two of my favorite dishes are the BLT Eggs Benedict and the Banana toffee Flapjacks. They also brew Intelligentsia coffee and always have great music blasting. Not your quaint little brunch spot.
"Where do I begin?? ?After being turned on to this by some friends it has become my go-to spot. ?My favorite thing about this place (other than the food of course) is the sense of family you get from the minute you walk in the door. ?Uncle as the regulars know him as is usually the first to say hello and make sure you get a seat. ? The food is unparalleled by any other asian place in the city. ?Everything is fresh and tasty. ?I am far from a vegetarian, but could find plenty to fill me up and make me leave happy. ?Everything on the menu is great, and i mean EVERYTHING!I order delivery from here a minimum of once a week. ?Needless to say, they know who I am. ?Everytime I call in, its like I'm calling family. ?They also offer a great deal if you aren't sure what to get, they have deals for pa"
"It sells itself. ��A classic Chicago bar, rich in history, in a classic Chicago neighborhood. ��For all you jet setters and tourists this place is pure Chicago. ��Classy too!"
"Like a lot of other people have said, the Deep Dish is the bomb, unlike anything you've had before. I'm kinda craving some right now, so I have to limit myself. In Chicago there is no shortage of pizza places....albeit, many of them very good. Lou Malnatis is sort of a staple of Chicago pizza, but a lot of people say Pequods is the best Chicago pizza in, well, Chicago. I prefer Giordano's (personal preference), but the food here is pretty nice."
"The best guacomole I have ever had. ��Food and drinks were excellent. ��A little on the pricey side, but worth it."
"I would highly recommend my clients and colleagues here in Minneapolis, the Gage Restaurant. ��We had just minutes before had a not so great experience at the Millenium Park's Park Grill's hostesses. ��My party of four which were in Chicago for a day trip, spotted the Gage by chance. ��We were greeted kindly, we were seated immediately, and we received tremendous service. ��We shared with them nothing about our experience at the Park Grill just minutes before but in some divine way they knew how to be servants. ��Thank you Gage Restaurant for doing that and sealing our overall impression of Chicago being a great place for a day trip."
"I LOVE LAVILLA! Everything about this place is to die for. The food is authentic Italian and if anyone doesn't like it then they must not know what real Italian food should taste like. I've been going here since I was baby and it is the only place I can actually think of that has the total package. The owners are sweethearts and are always there to satisfy everyone. No matter what I have ordered from the menu I have been pleased. Famous for their pizza (which is awesome) I like the baked mostoccioli. Whether I get it delivered, which is fast and prompt, or go there and eat in their dining room, I am always pleased. Also their banquet hall is very classy and can be used for any type of occasion. ��As good as it gets, best italian food!"
"Good pizza, horrible wait. Beer is okay."
"I and a group of seven friends just returned from a wonderful dining experience at Brazzaz. ��The service was exceptionally good. ��The waiters were considerate, came by our table at just the right frequency, and were friendly and respectful. ��The salad bar was terrific, indeed the best of the churrascarias at which we have dined. ��The mushroom risotto was great! ��The peppers and other vegetables were tasty and prepared well. ��The salmon, oysters, and shrimp were very good. ��The meat was, of course, great. ��Some others have complained about dry meat. ��We did not have that experience, but we ask for medium rare to rare portions. ��The red wines that we chose were very good, good nose and complex. ��The caiparinhas were were quite delicious. ��Always have a caiparinha before a churrascaria meal! "
"Pistachio Crusted Chicken. ��Enough said.Lunch, brunch, dinner, and drinks are all excellent at Cafe 28, with reasonable prices and an friendly staff. ��It rarely takes time to get a table, and sitting at the bar for a few minutes with a mohito is not a bother. ��You may have trouble parking around the area, but its proximity to the Brown Line (Irving Park Stop) is unbeatable."
"We tried this place on Valentine's Day, which obviously is one of the worst nights to go anywhere. ��Surprisingly, we only had to wait like 20 minutes, even though the place was packed. ��We were seated at a table for two, right next to a 2' by 2' vent, which was absolutely filthy and covered with dust. ��It was a turnoff, but I'd give the food a chance. ��We ordered drinks and our food, and got our drinks right away. ��I knew it was busy, so after an hour wait I decided to flag down our server. ��She asked if we were ready for dessert! ��I told her we never got our food, and her face went blank. ��We got our food about 5 minutes later and it was actually pretty good! ��Still, I couldn't give this place more than two stars considering how dirty it was. ��I'd like it better if I lived closer and went"
Fantastic Brazillian food ! I felt like I was in sao paulo again
"Alliance Bakery did my wedding cake this summer in June. It was so beautiful as well as delicious. They gave us a free tasting with several combinations of cakes and frosting and worked with us on design. Even when we made changes a few weeks later, they had no problem making adjustments. They worked directly with my florist for the fresh flowers I wanted on each layer of the 4 layer cake! Love them and cannot wait to go back for my free anniversary cake made to order next June. Thanks Lindsay."
"My boyfriend Milo and I had dinner at this great little restaurant today. Our waitress Daisy was fantastic. Friendly and helpful. And she smiles a lot which is always appreciated. The crepes were to die for, and I don't use that expression lightly. We will definitely be back soon!"
This is the place to go ��when you are looking for an amazing grilled fishLove their house merlo
"Last spring my husband and I traveled to Italy. While in Naples - the birthplace of pizza - we ate at Pizzeria da Michele, one of the most famous pizza places in Naples. Ever since that trip I have been craving that unique taste. It's the combination of the San Marzano tomatoes, the mozzarella di bufala and the high heat of the oven that you can't get just anywhere.Then I read about Spacca Napoli. Two weeks ago on a Saturday night, my husband and I tried Spacca Napoli. It was crowded, though that is expected on a Saturday night. We waited 30-40 minutes for a table, but it was fun watching the open kitchen and seeing just how quickly the pizza is cooked (less than 80 seconds!). The owner was playing host and was friendly, passing out delicious apps to the people waiting.We had a chance to l"
"I do like Wakamono. It's in a great location and the Sushi is fine. BUT there are so many sushi places in the neighborhood let a lone within 5 blocks of this place that I don't understand why it is so expenisve. Our bill for two people was over $100 and I don't think we ate that much and we only had 4 beers.The sushi was good, but for the price I would rather go somewhere else. The service is just OK. As with most Sushi restaurants, I don't think the service is ever amazing. The atmosphere inside is very cool although it was nice out so we sat outside. Some jack trying to parallel park hit the planter that outlined their patio made the glasses on our table fall over. The server looked at us like we purposely knocked them over so that we could be covered in beer. All in all, it was OK."
"The food is good here, but the restaurant itself could use a little update. The last time me and my wife went there I barely could understand the server, but he was really nice and fast. My wife had a delicious fish with a pine nuts. My stake was good, but I regretted that I did not ordered the fish."
"I think we go here every Sunday.... literally! The know us there but yeah... there's a reason we keep going back. Food is good, they're pretty fast, and the staff is really friendly. ��Love the pancake specials they have, esp carrot pumpkin.... and i also love the andouille chicken sausage, yummmm!"
yum yum yum...delicious Neopolitan pizza...i can't wait to go back!
"To preface this, it probably it not really 1 star. If I knew nothing about the place, I'd give it 2 or 3. Seeing how it has a Michelin star and everyone raves about it, this was one of the most disappointing experiences in my dining history. We caught it on a Tuesday relatively late, so there was no wait, which is nice. The wine list is less than stellar -- the place focuses on beers and bourbons, which should have been a red flag for us to begin with. We had tough time choosing what to order: everything seemed covered in butter, sugar and cream. I'm not some celery-obsessed crazy person, but I don't want my dinner to be 3,000 calories either... We had 2 appetisers and 2 entrees. They weren't bad, but they were not great either. Simply average.The place had no privacy. I was literally bump"
"If you're into totally RUDE people, go to Glenn's Diner. ?I took a business associate to Glenn's as we had just finished a nearby meeting. ?The tables outside were full, so we went inside. ?After being inside for a minute or so a female employee came up to us. ?In a very reproachfull tone, she said the door you came in is for staff only. ?For future reference please use the other door. ?I said ok.After another minute or so a server asked if we would like to sit inside or outside. ?I said outside but that I didn't think any tables were available. ?He said he was about to bring change to one table so they would likely be leaving soon. ?I asked if we should wait in or out; he said do whatever you want. ?We proceeded to wait outside and when the next group got up, we sat down.Five minutes or s"
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! AND THE OWNER IS WONDERFUL!I crave this place on a weekly basis. ��Everything is so fresh and tastes soooo goood! ��No comparsion to Pizza Doc at all !! Have been to both and without a doubt Spacca Napoli is the best! Every time I have been there the staff is wonderful and the owner has a good habit of giving you a free taste of a specialty beverage! I highly recommend this place!!
"I'll try to make my complaints brief and to the point. Honestly nothing we had was good and I actually felt ripped off.My friends and I had been trying to plan for weeks to go here just to try what they claimed is Montreal Poutine. There version was the biggest fail at poutine I have ever witnessed. My drunk friends at 6am have made better poutine with McDonalds fries. The gravy killed it, it was sweet and disgusting.The spinach salad was bland with barely any dressing.The veggie burger was terribly boring. Boring bread, boring patty and boring sauce. I tried it simply because it was advertised as being made in collaboration with Sage Francis.The biggest insult on the veggie burger was the fact that my caramelized onions were ice cold!! I took a bite and could understand why something was "
"This is by far one of the best establishments I've been to since I came to the city. I initially came inside in search of coffee and wi-fi, but within no time have become a regular of not only their coffee, but their amazing baked goods. And even outside of the great tasting foods and beverages, the staff is unlike any other. Not only are they EXTREMELY accommodating and pleasant to deal with, but they don't judge me when I come in hungover on a weekday. On the contrary, they offer anecdotes and quite possibly one of the best hang over cures I've ever had--their patented cinnamon roll. I love this place."
"Went there with my girl friend, and we love it. Hands down best steak house in chicago. She wants to go there every week. The steaks are great, our favorite is the alaskan king crab truffel gnocchi and the butter cake. highly recommended. only downside is the wait if you dont have a reservation and want to sit at the bar during dinner hour."
"Went to Chicago on our honeymoon just to try food by Rick Bayless. The Carne Asada a la Oaxaquena has become my favorite dish of all time. If in Los Angeles, the Carne Asada Brava is a great substitute at Red O, but has a bit more spice. Great patio seating. Be sure to make a reservation! We made the mistake of not doing so and waited over 2 hours to be seated, on a Thursday! However, Starbucks is up the street if you catch yourself in a similar situation or sit at the bar (if you can find a spot.) Bayless offers the absolute best of Mexican cuisine at affordable prices. Look forward to another trip to Chicago just for Frontera."
"Had to wait FOREVER for a table here at 3pm on a weekday. ��The pizza's pretty good, but not the best. ��I would use the pre-order service if I were you. ��When you put your name on the list, you can order your pizza. ��Then once you actually get seated, it doesn't take too long. ��I would hit it if I were a tourist but there's better around if you live here..."
"Great place, and I think the only place, for fast inexpensive middle-eastern food in Wicker Park. ��Make sure you know what you want before you get inline--the staff will be very nice about it, but not the people waiting behind you in line. ��The have a salad bar and carry middle-eastern grocery essentials. ��Outdoor seating is great when it's nice outside."
"Great place to hang with friends during the summer and for weekend brunch! ��The chicken burrito with guacamole is one of my favorites, and I love the horchata. Hmm Yummy"
A Gem!! ��I love this place!!A great lunch spot w/ very tasty ��& authentic food!
A wonderful place to eat with excellent pairings of wine. Everything about the dishes are above par. Not much to say on such a perfect place to eat if your willing to throw down some lute. The desserts are the best part. Go for a truly special occasion.
"Fresh food, nice service, great salads.I have been dieting and eating out can be a challenge. ��Not so at Icosium where I could select all the ingredients for a wonderful salad. Fresh, fresh, fresh! ��Crisp greens, interesting choice of vegetables, including artichokes and hearts of palm (favorites of mine), meat, cheeses, herbs and delicious dressings. ��Plus - the portion was tremendous! And the price was under $10 - if you haven't been there yet, go, go go!"
"Carnivale has a really cool atmosphere, but the food is not really to my liking. ��I had a hard time finding something on the menu that really jumped off the page to me and had me really excited to order. I eventually ordered the halibut, it was good, but not spectacular, and a little pricey. ��I do have to again give this place props on the atmosphere though."
no cat.... so you know its good!
"I have eaten here several times and all times have been average.This time I expected no different when we went to the GLC for lunch. ��The service was terrible. ��Took 30 minutes to take our order and the food took over an hour to come, and only to have issues with every item we ordered.The omelet was cold, frozen cold. ��Pre made and they just nuke it. BAD BAD and more BAD. ��The Grilled Chicken salad sent you search for the chicken and plain salad ordered with no dressing came smothered in it. ��They made no accommodations to repair the damage quickly. ��We were told the kitchen was backed up. ��Sorry but this is your primary business to cook and serve guest.The topper was when we paid the bill and asked for change, when we went to count the change the server stated ""I think I owe you a few mor"
"Very similar to the company's main chain, Cheesecake Factory, which I am a big fan of. ��Good food with excellent variety. ��Reasonably priced. ��Sometimes the wait can be long, especially during dinner time, but at least there is a waiting area inside."
"Highly recommended. ��I live in Lisle, Illinois, so I frequent the one in Downers Grove, Illinois of Ogden Ave. ��It is the best chinese food that I have had in Chicago. The food is authentic, flavorful, and the service is fast and friendly. �� And they remodeled the restaurant in Downers Grove, Illinois, so the dining environment is clean, warm and inviting.If you're a big fan of spicy foods, this is the place to go. ��They use authentic spices and their dishes put out a lot of heat."
"Love the sushi, but it's recently gone downhill. ��The passive aggressive waitress thought 15% tip was too little. ��- However it was more than adequate for her mediocre service. ��Will be a long time before I visit again..."
Yummy! This is a fun and hit spit to go if you're looking to mingle with friends! Love this place. I went here twice with girlfriends. Good place to go if you're looking for people in the mid 20's late 30's lots of good looking crowd dine here!
"Eh, I could take it or leave it. The menu is pretty simple, yet the food is not consistent or anything special. There are definitely a lot of other better brunch spots, but if you're in the neighborhood and want something quick, it's a safe bet. I do like the bright ambiance and the patio seating of this cafe, but the ordering process has a tendency to be a nightmare."
I love this place. I have been eating here when it first opened and nobody heard of them. Now sometimes its hard to get on the door. The subs are big for the money they charge and the pizza is good. My only complaint is sometimes the pasta sauce is a little too spicy for my taste. Other then that keep up the good work!!!
"Nice food, but really noisy! I prefer a quieter pub."
DELICIOUS! Arrived around 6:30 pm and there were 2 other tables..within placing our order the place was filled up..on a Monday night. We ordered:Calamari: lightly fried and seasoned it was very goodLobster Ravioli: served in a cream sauce rich & deliciousGnocchi: Filled with asiago & pesto (just the right amount) this is the BEST gnocchi I have ever had.Service was friendly and never made you feel like they were trying to rush you out to seat more tables.Try it..you will like it
"We had the opportunity to dine at Mastros on Sunday night and from start to finish a great experience thanks to our waiter Neal. My husband who travels to the SW often for work was very excited when Mastros finally opened here in Chicago. So we decided to stop by on Sunday night for dinner without reservations and was greeted by Michael the Maitre D' and he promptly checked us in an escorted us to our table. Our server came over with a big smile and warmly welcomed us and thanked us for waiting patiently for them to open here in Chicago. So my husband told our waiter (Neal) that he would like him to go over his whole speech about the menu for me, I tell you he did not miss a beat. We are not a fan of red meat, But there is so much more to Mastros than their Steaks. After chatting with our "
"Seriously, best food I've ever put in my mouth. Every bite was incredible! Killer margaritas, fresh guacamole, home made warm tortillas, and the best MOLE I could ever imagine. ��Our party of 4 all raved about their dishes, and it will be an experience we'll never forget! ��I'll never look at Mexican food the same again!"
"Just returned from Brazazz. ��Compared to Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil, Brazazz comes in a distant third. ��Service was so-so, not much attention was paid to us until it was time to turn the table. ��Salad bar was standard for this type of restaurant. ��Texas de Brazil's salad bar is much better, but you are not there to eat salad. ��They seemed to bring the cheaper cuts of meat - Chicken and Sausages, early and often. ��We had to ask for beef. ��The filet was well done and dry. ��Our waiter started hovering around us at the 1:30 mark as if they had another reservation they needed to seat. ��For the money, Fogo de Chao or Texas de Brazil offers a better dining experience."
"Go immediately and get the Guajirito: steak, romaine lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, and swiss cheese on flattened green plaintains (instead of bread). I'm a veg, and they were happy to substitute grilled portobello mushroom for steak, but I've no doubt it's amazing with the steak. The soup was no hot enough, but was very good. Wife had the tofu sandwich, which also had grilled red peppers and black beans, and a cheese empanada, which I tried and was excellent. Very cool space that has been decorated very well. Also recommend the hot sauce. They serve several types of coffee drinks, too, with a cuban twist. Didn't try those today, but will asap. Also great cuban music playing."
"I created a Yelp account just so I could comment on this place. The food is pretty good, the decor is nothing to write home about and the location/parking for this place...meh. But the reason I love this place so much is because of the owner. He is perhaps the sweetest man I have ever met. He always welcomes you into his establishment with a smile and you can't help but be in a good mood when you leave. I support this restaurant because it is in my neighborhood and they have been going through some rough financial times (there is a great tear-jerking article about this place in Time Out Chicago). I believe supporting businesses that continually go above and beyond - these are the nicest people and the food is good, so I try and go once a week.Now for the food...the curry is flavorful - I r"
"We had their signature dish, Peking duck, which was a total rip off. They carve the duck at the table side and left so much meat on the bone that even my 17 year old daughter noticed and made comment. The waiter said that they use the rest of the duck to make the soup and duck fried rice which is included in the hefty $38 price. However, it appeared that much of the remaining meat left on the carcass did not appear in the fried rice or the soup. The Peking duck was good but is not actually made with the real Peking duck cooking method, the duck broth tasted like it was made with a boullion cube and the fried rice was nothing special and tasted like any other type of fried rice. We would have been better off separately ordering their roast duck which at least one could be sure was the entir"
Everything was spectacular! Will definitely be back again soon.
"I came in here for lunch on a thursday afternoon. (I was getting a bit tired of the things they offered in my neighborhood) The biggest concern I had with going to Lincoln Park was the pricing. however Simply It defied that idea! Soup, salad, lunch entree, lemonade and fruits at the end of my meal. Amazing! All for under 10 bucks too! Show me any other place that does that much food for under 10 dollars in Lincoln Park and I'll be astounded.It was so good that I came back for dinner that night with a group of friends. The dinner was also amazing. I tried the Simply It's Beef and it was absolutely astounding. The beef cubes were just oh so tender and all of my friend's meals were delicious as well.I'm definitely coming back here for lunch more often and dinner as well! Great value, and grea"
Great gourmet southern food!
"The pizza here was good, and I would give it 4 stars, but after I try eating left overs (later in the evening) - it was hard and terrible. I learned from my father that good food tastes good even cold and after few hours. Bathroom was dirty"
"A week later and I still dream about going back!If you could lick everything you love in the Museum of Contemporary Art, the purple pig is what it would taste like.Stop reading these reviews and just go."
"I really love this place. I live kind of in the area so I come here quiet often. The pizza is so good and I agree with all the other reviewers, the crust is amazing."
"We had a wonderful, traditional Chinese meal (the famous duck service) at a great price.The service was a little stiff, but these people are busy for a good reason.The duck is the big draw here, but I've been told to try a variety of their other choices and I will definitely be back."
My boyfriend and I did not have a good experience here at all. The service was slow and extremely unfriendly almost rude(like they did not want us there). I found the food to be typical American Italian and boring. My salad was totally overdressed and the rissoto was not cooked the way rissoto should be. My boyfriends pasta had way too much sauce and the pasta was totally overcooked. We will not be coming back. The staff should be ashamed!
"I trekked here for my birthday with friends earlier this month, and everyone in my party LOVED the food! I became vegan a few months ago, and it is immensely refreshing to come to such a restaurant with its large vegan menu. They prepare their veggies in many tasty ways (including with pesto sauce, mmmmm...), but the highlight is the vegan comfort food (country-fried steak, BLT, etc). Only one other person in my group of 7 was vegan and the rest all eat meat, and EVERYONE found something delicious and filling. I had to keep giving my friends more sips of my chocolate chip cookie dough milk-shake, because they couldn't stop marveling that it was dairy-free. As for the staff: The waiters are friendly, funny, and well-informed about all of the dishes on the menu. And when our server heard tha"
This place is highly overrated. The food is lousy and it runs about $20 per person for dinner. Not recommended.
This bar is awesome! ��Probably my favorite in the city. ��Great ambiance and excellent food. ��Plus everything is Oscar Wilde themed so if you like literature at all you will really enjoy yourself. ��Love Love Love this place! ��Great place to bring a date.
"SIMPLY THE BEST SUSHI YOU WILL HAVE IN CHICAGO!!Service is always great, Ive never had anything that wasnt PERFECT!!My personal fav is the spicy tako roll!!"
"Whether it's breakfast or dinner you are in the mood for, this is a must stop & eat place! With local artists' work hanging on the walls, I've never been disappointed with the food, or the service. Great for Saturday/Sunday mornings, or if you are sneaking an early lunch. Drink as much coffee as you like at this hidden gem."
"How do they manage to keep the prices so low here? The food is of exceptional quality you would really expect to pay alot more. The place has kept pace through the years thanks to the devoted efforts of Aunt Irene Mastropaolo, who knows good food and loves people! I have to attribute the extra 5 pounds I've been carrying around to the cannoli here, which are the perfect way to end a meal. Favorite entree: Veal Saltimbocca. YUM!"
"As first-time visitors to Chicago, we wanted to enjoy some fresh and delicious seafood. We searched the Internet and chose Shaw's because of the recommendations submitted by fellow yelpers. My som ordered the steak with a crab cake. I ordered the seafood combination. The waitress warned us about the size of the side dishes so we shared the spinach and the mashed potatoes. I was not sure about the freshness of my crab cake and my grilled shrimp were overdone. The food in general was not as delicious as expected based on the price. We both disliked the key lime pie we had for dessert. We wouldn't revisit this restaurant."
"Alinea = Excellent experience! What an amazing experience my husband and I had at this wonderful place! And that was just the walk down the hallway!!! Is it pricey? yes. Is it worth the price? TOTALLY. The food, is truly a culinary adventure. The time and the creativity that goes into each course is really difficult to put into words. The only way you will understand is if you experience it for yourself.The staff is so helpful and friendly, the decor is absolutely beautiful. Not only will your taste buds thank you, all of your senses will thank you as well.If you have to open a separate savings account just to experience this dining experience, DO IT! You will not be disappointed."
"Went to Nana for brunch with a small group - and was hoping for something great after all the positive reviews - especially since so many great brunch places are on the north side and I live in Pilsen. ��In the end, it was ok - I've definitely had better. ��My partner got the tofu scramble with 'seasonal vegetables' (we're debating how in season and locally grown bell peppers can be in the Midwest). ��The black beans tasted like they were from a can and the veggie chorizo was kind of meh. ��My roommate got the garden omelet with 'foraged mushrooms' that looked an awful like the regular button mushrooms that you get at the store ... ��I enjoyed my veggie benedict - but, again, the side of vegetables was pretty bland. ��Definitely enjoyed the pear cocktail though. ��Maybe the meat dishes are better"
"greatest hot dogs ever! the duck fat fries are to die for. extremely friendly service. cool music and decor. the owner doug takes the orders and could not be any nicer. don't be afraid of the line outside, it moves pretty quick and is WELL worth the wait."
"Xoco is Rick Bayless's third restaurant and is focused on street food. It's meant to be a place to grab a quick lunch. The menu consists mostly of tortas, but damn are they amazing. I had the special of the day which had pork belly and bacon on it. All the ingredients are of the highest quality and so fresh that I wanted to moan while eating my sandwich. I thought I'd have to wait, but it looks like the hype is gone and I was seated immediately. It's counter service, but they have a really good seating set up so customers aren't left standing waiting for a seat. I highly recommend this and will most certainly be returning."
Amazing gastropub. ��even though they forgot to bring me my beer.. the food is absolutely incredible. ��I just went to Alinea days before.. and Longman & Eagle blew my mind.the lamb was my favoritethe scallops perfectpork belly so greatcan't wait to go back.
"I've had my share of trendy brunch places and this place is the best one I've had thus far. It's all the great brunch foods, trendiness, and atmosphere without the ridiculous prices. Everything on the menu is a super good price. I'm talkin like ihop prices! I had the Salmon Benedict which was really good. The whole fruit garnish thing is cool but a little inconvenient as I feel like I have to eat my grapes first so they don't accidentally mix with my ketchup or something. Ew! haha ...but it is cool concept. Anyway for the prices, this place is definitely a must try"
"My cousin and I went here on Tuesday for fried chicken night. ��There are a lot of great places to eat in Chicago, but this was the best all around restaurant experience I've had in a long time. ��The service was outstanding, it made the night to be treated so well. ��Our waitress was extremely polite but not overbearing. ��When I had a question about the wine she enthusiastically got an answer for me, which made me feel great about the second glass. ��The busser was also wonderfully attentive yet non-instrusive. ��They just made us feel good and quietly helped us enjoy the meal and the night out.They give you these delicious corn muffins with honey butter instead of bread. ��Our grandmother will send back anything that doesn't come out hot enough to scald your tongue, and the food came so out pi"
"Simply phenomenal!!! This is the second time I dine at Sapori Trattoria, and I'll be sure to return every time I visit Chicago.Not only do they take the concept of pasta to a whole new level with sauces that are out of this world, they also offer exquisite appetizers, the freshest seafood, and a wine selection to please just about anyone.The staff is most friendly, and the service was fast, considering that they were completely packed on a Monday evening.For appetizer I had the 'Crostini di Avocado'. ��No... it's not guacamole! It's much lighter and more sophisticated. A perfect balance of flavor, lightness and creativity. Next, I had the Spaghetti Barese. 'Nona' will have to forgive me this time; I used to think she was the one who made the best meatballs in the world, but Sapori's are jus"
"I love Fifty/50! This is my favorite place to go in the city. The food is amazing, the staff is awesome,the crowd is fun, the bar is super clean, ��and the owners really know how to run a bar. They have great drinks and their food is not your average bar food...its way better, they have a very well put together menu with lots of variety. This is the perfect place to watch a game, hang out with friends, have a party...it's perfect for anything any day of the week. The DJ is always good! There is always something going on at Fifty/50! I love, love, love this place and have only the best things to say! I have had a great experience every single time I've been here, i definitely recommend going here."
"While the food was really fun, more eccentric, yummy...our service left something to be desired. ��We asked for help sorting through the menu, and got a blank stare and smile. ��The gentleman that cleared our plates was more interactive. ��Would go back for the food, and hope for better service. ��You want to be able to ask your server for recommendations, especially with a menu you are unfamiliar with and willing to try new and different."
Penette cardinale is my favorite. ��I always get it. ��Great wine list as well.
"We had a party of six and decided to give this place a try as it always seemed busy - BIG mistake - ��this was some of the worst Chinese food we had in a while (all six of us felt the same way). Service was terrible in the beginning (the restaurant was still fairly empty at this point) and after several requests for more water and rice, we tried to voice our dissatisfaction with the service, which with 6 people was an automatic 15 percent tip added to the bill. Everyone we tried to talk to claimed not to understand English or even Cantonese, including the hostess. Each person just said they did not understand and point to someone else. How can you provide service not speaking English or even Cantonese which is the main dialect in Chinatown. Service aside, onto the food... We had ordered sev"
"Fafafel great, everything else i tried ��good but not great."
"This is the kinda place that just makes you wanna become Greek. Food is amazing, Saganaki, Avgalemono soup,Tatamousalata, great appetizers for any party. From the Greek chicken to the beef kabobs everything is amazing. But the best item there has to be the Pastitsio (Greek Lasagna) just makes you cry when you eat it so good"
"Absolutely disgusted on our wedding night.Great reviews, atmosphere, and food but the service was a ZERO. ��3 hrs of sitting at a table waiting to eat.We had a reservation for a wedding party two weeks in advance and showed up with all in a limo at one time. ��We discovered that we had one waiter who also had responsibility for other tables. ��He took our drink orders, brought the drinks, took appetizer orders for some but not all people, had to be asked 3 times to refill drinks, and it took 15 mins and two requests with two waiters to get a Mojito. ��After 1 hr and nearly eating the appetizers (for those who ordered), I walked across the restaurant to inquire about ordering our meals to which the server replied that he was waiting for all to finish their appetizers. ��I told him that was ridic"
"Very good, like all the pork dishes, sardines were great, veggie dishes usually just ok, sometimes not worth the wait for a table."
"Wonderful cozy BYOB (!!) with flavorful, reasonably priced food (decent sized entrees around $10-14) and the BEST waitstaff/owners EVER. �� Seriously these people are genuinely warm and way too cute. ��There was a group of 7 of us and I can't really remember what everyone got, though my friend's order of Simply It Beef was melt-in-your-mouth good! (will def get that next time I go). ��The best part was they made these delicious fried banana desserts for us (3 plates of 3 bananas each with chocolate sauce and whipped cream) on the house! ��Thats right, free dessert!The place is well-light and nicely decorated, and the bathrooms were really clean. ��Overall fun atmosphere for a group or a nice place for a date too.They've got a bunch of good deals going on these days (i.e. prix fixe deals for mul"
"I ventured out of Hyde Park with some nerdy friends of mine on Friday. Yes, nerdy friends and we were a little hesitant to come to this place, because there were lots of pretty and trendy folks that you could tell probably had money to throw around.Us poor grad students walked in anyways, because we heard the food was really good and were greeted by the hostess. She was smiley and got us to a table after about a 5 minutes wait at the bar.We started with the goat cheese pitas and we all had French Onion soups. The cheese was melted perfectly for the soup and the server told us that they make everything from scratch. You could tell.Based on our servers suggestions, I had the Triple Secret Burger, my friend had the skirt steak sandwhich, and my other friends split the ribs. Everybody was in h"
"Overpriced (4 people $600.00), average food at best. Drinks were 'way overpriced ($10 for a beer- REALLY). ��I had to get a slice of pizza afterwards. This place is all hype and no WOW factor to come back.One think I have to say is the service was great. ��Then again it should be after what we paid."
"Every city should have a Sultan's Market - good, healthy food at an amazingly decent price."
So good. ��I was sent here by the people at Apartment People. ��They were raving about it when I was signing my lease so I had to try it. ��Best fried chicken I have ever had. ��Chicken sandwich was just as good.YUMMM!!!
"So...My fiance wanted to take me out for desert. Although I'm a native of Chicago, I've never been to this place. He figured the ambiance would be fabulous and have an overall inviting atmosphere. SIKE! Let me tell you the story...We walked in and was quickly seated. The waitress came over and asked had we been there before, and if not would we like her to give a description of the meals etc. My fiance says sure.. So as she begins to tell us what they had to offer, he realized that we wanted to stick with what we originally went there for. He says I think we'll just go with the flaming chocolate fondue. Waitress says, Yes, I figured you all would say that. Eyebrows raised but I said nothing. Then we ordered drinks that we had to remind the waitress to get 10 mins. later. The couple sitting"
"I don't get this place. ?I've heard so many people say hot dog's is great and they seem to love this place, but every person who loves this place are usually not from Chicago, and think ooh, look, hotdogs and a long line, and we're in Chicago, let's squeeze our ass cheeks together and waddle over there. ?The specialty sausages are nothing special. ?The duck fat fries were burnt and nothing special when I got them. ?It's a hot dog guys. ?I'm not going to wait an hour for a mediocre hot dog or sausage. ?Just because it's says specialty sausage doesn't make it less mediocre. ?Go to the store, get some Vienna beef, and some s.rosen hot dog buns, chop up an onion and get some mustard. ?Same thing and you save 45 minutes waiting in line."
"Starts off bad, ends up fair. That is what I have experienced with life and dining in restaurants are no exception to this rule.The wait was long and we were offered a pager and free coffee at another establishment down the block. Huh? it is 20 degrees outside and I am leaving your restaurant to have coffee elsewhere?After being seated in the middle of the restaurant and effectively feeling the doors open and close like being seated at an outdoor cafe in February, we were promptly served coffee and water.The menu is vast. The service was pretty good, however, the food was fair. This place had so many great reviews that I had high expectations. The toast was burnt and coffee only filled once. If I could get past the baby (and I have kids so please) stuck coughing all over the diners, I woul"
"My boyfriend took me here the other night and absolutely everything about this restaurant was perfect from the moment we walking in. ��We were a bit nervous about how much it had been hyped up by fellow Yelpers and our friends and family, but it was the PERFECT evening! ��Food, cocktails, sake, service, everything was absolutely on spot. ��Other reviewers aren't kidding when they say it gets loud in there, but I think it really adds to the ambiance of the entire place. ��Will most definitely be back many, many times!"
"The food here is phenomenal. ?Very unique Mediterranean cuisine, and it's dirt cheap. ?My falafel was $3.75. ?If this sold at Panera it'd go for $6-7 easily. So, I get it. ?Great food at a great price. ?But there's more than that to a restaurant. ?You have cleanliness and service... and this place fails at these in some aspects.They were quick to make my falafel, smacked it on a tray, and that was it. ?Nobody was at the cash register. ?I walked aimlessly around trying to figure out where to pay. ?Eventually I got greeted by a gentlemen who said You gonna pay for dat?!?!? ?I apologized saying I wasn't sure where to pay -- the cash register is awkwardly placed high on a table which is hard to recognize. ?I can only imagine the people that run off not paying at this place.So Sultan's, I give "
Italian food is my favorite so when looking for a place to go for our anniversary an Italian restaurant we haven't been to was first on our list. ��When we saw the reviews for Sabatino's we thought it sounded great. ��We had high expectations as we arrived. ��Unfortunately we were disappointed. ��We were greeted and seated in a timely fashion. ��After sitting down and ordering the restaurant became uncomfortably cold. ��The bread was great but very messy. ��We saw a gentleman scraping crumbs of another table and thought that we would be next. ��But we never were and we spent the rest of the meal with crumbs on the table. ��The roaming singers were going around to the tables and playing some songs. ��They went to the table next to us and played three songs then came to our table and played one song a
"Greasy, gamey, meh. Futher encouragement to stop eating meat for good. Even the ball and chain wouldn't get near the leftovers....nuff said!"
"A friend and I had an incredible dinner at Carnivale. The ambiance was grand and festive. Walking into Carnivale is not stepping into a restaurant, it's stepping into an experience. The decor of the main dining hall is colorful and dramatic with vaulted ceilings and creative lighting. The setting was only outdone by the amazing dishes we ordered. We started out with a sashimi-style ceviche - delicious! As an entree I ordered the skirt steak complimented by a chimichuri sauce. I've told friends it was THE best skirt steak I've had. The latin flavors were divine. My friend ordered the seared tuna which was also incredible.Carnivale was the best part of my weekend trip to Chicago!"
"I went to Cafe 28 recently and was disappointed with the food. ��We ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer, shrimp quesadillas, veggie fajitas, and a couple of steaks. ��The goat cheese appetizer and the quesadillas were both cold, even though they came out very shortly after we had ordered. hmmm? �� The fajitas did not have very good flavor, and the tortillas were not warmed. ��I didn't try the steak, but my friends both said it was ok (it was the rib-eye steak). ��I tried a mojito -- it was weak and not flavorful. ��At least it came in a pint glass.I will say that the service was very good, food came out quickly, and the server was attentive without being annoying. ��We were also seated immediately, and the atmosphere was pleasant and warm. All staff we interacted with were friendly."
"Anteprima is probably my most favorite italian restaurant in the andersonville/edgewater neighborhood. It's small, cozy, kinda rambunctious atmosphere is perfect for small get togethers with friends or family. Perfect for a date if you don't mind the close quarters and cacophany of mingled conversations. The food definetly makes up for it. The wine list is fairly full and looks complex if you're unfamiliar with italian wine terminology. Servers have always been patient to explain them or offering recommendations on similar wines not on the list. Most servers have asked if we've dined there before, but there have been a few times when the server just plops the menu down. For the most part the servers are attentive, weekends or busy nights you might have to make extra effort to be noticed.Th"
Cory approved.
"Great place to take kids for breakfast, It's clean and bright and the staff is upbeat, very nice to kids. ��The portions are over the top. ��Two breakfasts are always enough for my wife, two boys with pretty good appetites and me! ��Get the fruit, granola and yogurt thing they serve in a hollowed out pineapple, plus order any egg dish, and you have a feast for four. ��Be prepared to wait on the weekend even though the place is huge. ��In nice weather you can wait outdoors, and there is a great bike shop (Trek) next door."
"i was visiting a friend in chicago for new year's and we came to yolk for breakfast on sunday and what a great time. ��the food was awesome, the service was great and what a vibrant atmosphere. ��watching the owner taki at the counter preparing the food and his friend who sat us was a real treat, 2 handsome studs. ��i'll be coming back to chicago really soon. ��thanks yolk!!"
"I've never eaten inside of Wakamono, usually get take out or delivery. ��I love the Godzilla roll. ��One of my faves, and the sunomo is great too. ��The reviews regarding the music ��are true. ��When I pick up my order, it hard to even communicate just my name. ��But the place is almost always packed. ��This summer I will be eating outside. ��It's a great people watching area!!!"
"Okay so, I just got home from eating at the chicago diner and it was super duper good! I had a college visit at UIC and had to check it out. I read a ton of reviews before going so my expectations were high. Upon entering, I was shocked my the small size. Its super tiny! I (4 year vegetarian) came with my mom (meat eater) and there was like three 2 person tables available and we were seated almost right away. It was full of hipsters with their skinny jeans and tattoos. haha, it was cute. The waiters/waitresses were super hip and sweet. My water was never empty. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip for our appetizer and it was good but not great. It coulda used more spinach but we still ate it all. I got the avocado tostados since i was nervous about the whole fake meat thing. My mom got th"
Tip: ��1/2 menu M-F at the sushi bar and communal table. �� Tail of Tunas roll. �� ��Enough said.
"Yum Yum YUM!!I have been eating superdawg since I was bornI love it so much!People say the fries are nothing special..But they are the best i have ever tasted..The boxes they come in make my laugh, because everytime I go and get a superdawg, I have to eat all the fries first if I am in the car or else it will be too messy.Its kind of annoying because the change there hotdogs a lot, like sometimes they are thinner and then they are..Huge! But all in all they are really good.Its a really fun place...Ahh I want one right now..But I am too lazy to get one..haha. Don't put ketchup on this hotdog..I thnk it ruins the experience..hah. and when you order a superdawg, don't call it a hotdog, because most or the time they will be like..What is that??haha I love this place"
I loved everything.....................................
"I love Fox and Obel! Great gourmet grocery store, my favorite and a must when I'm in Chicago - we go here on Sunday mornings and order coffee & pastries and eat there, great place to just sit and talk, read the paper and plan to day!"
"I'm a meat eating fiend, but needed a place to take a veggie friend of mine visiting the city last fall. ?I love Chicago Diner, because I actually LOVED everything I tried! ?The biscuits and gravy were killer. ?And I cannot believe that vegan cheesecake can actually be awesome!I'm sold on the food!That being said, I'm going to have to point out my usual complaint about Chicago Service. ?Kinda non existent. ?Maybe it's because I prefaced my questions with Ok, so I'm not even close to a vegetarian.... but I didn't really find my servers answers to my questions to be really.... answers. ?Maybe I'm annoying because I like to ask lots of questions about food [especially about food I'm unfamiliar with (see my recent review of VOLO for how to answer my million questions successfully)] but isn't t"
"One of my favorite places in Chicago. There aren't too many bars that I would wait in line to get into, but this is one of them. I love the service, atmosphere and the cocktails."
"Nice and simple decor. ��On Sunday night the place was quite busy. ��The service was fast, the food was good. ��Only problem... too much food!"
"I love this place. ��The food's great and the experience is so much fun. ��Great neighborhood, nice people behind the counter and bringing food to your car."
"Every time I go to Chicago I make it a point to get one of their amazing deep dish pizzas. ��I haven't been to Chicago in years and I am very much missing one of their delicious deep dished mushroom pizzas. ��Made the mistake once of getting soup and salad-both were very bland, which is why the place gets 4 stars instead of 5."
"I agree with Alex C., can't stand without Pho Tank ��in 1 week. knowing noodle pho from other places are better, but they just can't satisfy the craving of pho like Tank does. In this cold winter just wanna stay warm at home, not a movie, not a steak dinner can drag me out of the my house, except Tank noodle. yelp friends! please share your experince. I wonder I am not the only one."
"I love this place, especially for Brunch. ��The pancakes, juevos rancheros and orange brioche french toast are the BEST items on the menu. ��The only unfortunate thing is there is always a line...the tables turn pretty quickly, but sometimes you just want to go to a place and sit down right away....especially when hungover on a sunday morning. ��Oh well, I guess that's what happens when there is fabulous food!"
"I rated Meli Cafe one star because of the serviceFood: 5 starsService: I have been coming here for about 5 years, why? because of their food but i gave up ! Be ready to wait in line outside.The restaurant TABLES ARE SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER;after you finally get a table the waitresses RUSH YOU TO ORDER, wait staff is only women it seems THEY HIRE them BASED ON THEIR LOOKS and NOT THEIR EXPERIENCE. They rarely smile and they stand there staring at your table and if you seemed to be done with your meal forget about having having a chat while you enjoy your cofee they will come several times to ask you if you are done or will bring the bill immediately! THE BUS BOYS do all the work and they seem very stressed, they slam the dishes while they clean on the tables near you, THEY STILL HAVE A BETTE"
"We had an awful experience at Chicago Diner. Not only was the food heavy and medicore, we all got stomach problems afterwards!! I'm not sure if the restaurant was having an off-day or what, but it was not worth the stomach problems. Even if we didn't get sick, we also did not enjoy the food - this place is all hype!"
the one from my favorite places....mojito the best ever..
Best crust! ��Could eat the pizza every day.
"I was in the city Tuesday. ��A friend and I went to Wishbone ��for a late lunch. The staff was good,we didn't wait long. My friend had the burger and was very pleased with it. ��I on the other hand had salmon. ��Everything started well until I got to the center of the fish. ��It was still frozen! �� I felt a ��little sick! ��Our waiter was very nice about it , he even took it off the bill. I think I will not go there for awhile!I have gone to the wishbone again,however I didn't find it very good.I had the salad and it wasn't very fresh."
"Great food, love it here!!"
My friend took me here for the first time few days ago. The food are super delicious!!!! We really could not stop eating. The service was ok. They changes the grill for us as soon as it turned bad. I will go back if I have a chance to go visit my friend in Chicago again!
"I love this FOGO2Go's chiken, rice and beens.. they have also good pizza,too..mmmmm yam.."
"This review is not about the restaurant nor the food. I'm just going to comment on the service i got when i was at Alinea.Excellent service. At least one waiter would stand unobtrusively in the background at all times to tend to my needs and they were really very respectful and very prompt.I love it here, the food may not be that delicious as the other restaurants but the service is what will make people come back."
"I give this place 4.5 stars because although the food is great, this place is small and can get so crowded to the point that you have to shout at people in your own group at times. It's also quite common for everyone--including the wait staff and customers--to consistently bump into your table or chairs. Not exactly what i want to happen when I'm trying to eat dinner. I don't even need to detail what we ate, because everything I've ever ordered at either of the Francesca's locations has been spot on amazing. It's not adventurous dining by any means, it's just reliable, fresh, well prepared utterly delicious food. Solid 4.5 stars all around.Our appetizers (fried calamari - lightly breaded and fried perfectly so you could still admire the true fish taste; bruschetta - loved the variation and"
"I love Geja's! ��It is so romantic and just a great atmosphere. ��I've gone with my boyfriend and my parents- each time it's amazing in a different way. ��Everyone that I know has heard of Geja's and has a great story from going there. ��Definitely somewhere everyone has to try at least once, and will probably go back again and again!"
"The lounge is very upscale, trendy and sexy. If only it didn't take 20 minutes to get a drink each time. I really don't care how freaking fantastic a place is, if it takes the server 20 min. to bring me a drink each time, I'll pass and go somewhere else. I had their blood orange mojito..the first one was very good, then they switched bartenders and the second mojito, well, I don't think there was any rum in it whatsoever. If they get better waitresses in the lounge area or if there's an open seat at the bar and actually put booze in their drinks I'd go back. Also, I hear their rooftop's pretty cool, in the summer. Maybe I'll just bring a flask with me and order pops while sipping out of my flask during the 20-min. it'll take for the waitress to bring me my drink."
"Visiting Chicago on business from California, I was determined to find a really good BBQ Rib place in a nice part of town,close to my hotel near Navy Pier. After reading reviews on Yelp, We decided to try Chicago Q. Our waiter, LaTiff was wonderful, He took us thru the menu, made recommendations, and, to my delightful surprise, informed us that the person who was in charge of BBQ was none other than LeAnn Whippen. I had watched LeAnne compete on BBQ Pitmasters and knew she is considered a Grand Champion in the sport of BBQ. Without hesitation I ordered the Competition St. Louis ribs. Absolute best I have ever had. I passed on the 4 sauces that were served with it, as the flavor needed to be savored on it's own. The side of jalapeno corn bread was perfect. Oh,and those buttered pickles were"
"I have been looking for a good cuban sandwich shop ever since living in Boston and frequenting a cuban sandwich stand. Finally, I have found it! Their sandwiches are full of flavor and filling, and their yucca chips are delicious. I would highly recommend for a quick lunch!"
"I recently just came here with my mother and her boyfriend. ��Usually there is a long wait to get into this restaurant because of the pizza and the service. ��Luckily we got at the restaurant at 4 in the afternoon on Black Friday and were able to get a table and order our pizza right away. ��The pizza was amazing as usual. ��I grew up eating Chicago Deep Dish Pizza and this is my favorite by far. ��The service here is excellent as well. ��The next time I come home for the holidays from Purdue University, I will defintely be back for more fabulous pizza!!!"
"This is so yummy. Try the Seoul and Sassy. There was lots of flavor!!! I didn't really care for the tables. Honestly I am not a big fan of sitting with other customers. I value my personal space. Other than that, I love the food. Will be back again. Possibly for take out!"
"anybody who doesn't like this place is simply not human, not normal and extremely ridiculous. this place is amazing. everything about it from the food to the staff. i've had religious experiences here. go asap. you're life depends upon it.doug is god."
"My wife and I can't get enough of their crepes. This place is perfect for lunch, dinner I haven't tried their breakfast but I'm sure it's delicious.I brought a friend from France there and he said it was the best place he's been to in the US.I actually can't wait to go back !"
"Went there. ��Floored by the pricing. ��Especially as, working in the grocery business (not a competitor of F & O), I recognized a lot of the brands, sources and knew what the wholesale prices were for the products. ��A lot of the grocery items are sourced from an everyday wholesaler who specializes in products that have most of their cost in the ""artisan"" packaging than in the contents, and are marked up considerably. ��Read the ingredient labels with a heavy dose of reality. The wines can all be sourced by anyone in the business from a very limited cadre of suppliers, again, ordinary wholesalers, seriously marked up. ��Just a pickpocket experience, except no finesse about it, just a fist stuck in my pocket dragging out all of my cash.Cafe was a bore. ��Same old same old for a lot of money. ��Ba"
"I've been eating at Opart for seven years now and I think it is the best Thai food in the city. Their Pad Ki Mao is the standard I judge all others by. The noodles are thick and have perfect texture while the beef manages to be both thin and juicy. I have been impressed with everything I have eaten from Opart, and I've eaten a lot of their dishes. Every employee I've ever dealt with here has been friendly and helpful. Plus they are BYOB, which is great. Their food holds up well as take-out too."
"Please understand that this review is coming from a die-hard thin crust, New York style, brick oven pizza lover. ��I think deep dish is, ""not my bag baby!"" ��There is an incredibly large amount of cheese in each pie. ��The sauce and toppings were good and the crust was fine, but Oh my gosh the Cheese!! ��The restaurant itself was nice and you could pre-order while you waited which was also a bonus. ��If you like deep dish I""m sure Giordano's is fine. If you like thin crust but think, ""I should try Chicago style deep dish,"" run don't walk from Girodano's. ��Your stomach will thank me later."
"Romantic, cozy, and the longest dinner....ever... haha. Took my friend here for her birthday. She's a vegetarian so she got the $25 vegetarian course. I did as well. We felt a bit awkward because there were couples everywhere ... haha. We sat RIGHT next to the flamenco guitar guy ... too close for comfort actually. The cheese and chocolate fondues aren't that special. I liked the hot oil fondue though. I never knew that fondue also meant hot oil till I heard about this place. Filling and would be a great spot for a date... but it's going to take 2 hours or so if you order the 3 course. ��I ...uhh...kind of fell asleep while frying the veggies... hahahaha. It's all dark and then the flamenco guiar is playing right next to me... couldn't help it."
"Went to q tonight with a group of 10. ��We arrived for our 8:30 reservation, but weren't seated until 9:20. ��Had that been the end of the night, it definitely would have been a 1-star review. ��However, they recovered somewhat by offering the table some free appetizers. ��Food was very good, and the atmosphere is great. ��I'd go back, but definitely with a smaller group...."
"This is hands down the best pizza in the city. ��I know we all feel quite loyal to the classic Chicago deep dish, and while that is nice to put ourselves in a food coma every once in a while, Spacca's pizza will keep you craving and raving. ��It might seem a little pricey for a smaller pizza, but it's the price is erased after your first bite of delicious dough. ��The arugula and parm pizza will light your taste buds on fire. ��And the specials are always to be acknowledged. ��If you haven't tried this place, it's a must. ��Leave a little room for a shared dessert and you will be coming back for more as soon as possible."
If you are on the North Side of Town I can't tell you how great the food is here. The presentation is fantastic. The food is great the service is great everything is awesome. And yes as mentioned before the Crab Rangoon is out of this world. BYOB is great for any restaurant and there is a party store around the corner in case you forget. ��Again check this place out if you can.
THIS place is ok if you have had dinner before. Otherwise you will pay through the nose and still wonder: have I eaten anything? Quite pricey!!!
"The place is beautiful and the coffee is great. I like the organic factor, especially the eggs and the fresh fruit. However, I'm not overly wowed by Nana. The menu is not very diverse, and they were out of a basic staple, oatmeal. The waiter was not sure of several things we asked him, and the OJ, while freshly-squeezed, was way overpriced. ?Finally, our bill was weird and hard to decipher, listing things under other names and vague in spots."
Good food and good service. ��I went to the Apple Store with my girlfriend and decided to come here always walking by but never checking it out. ��A lot of tourists but have to expect that on Michigan. Like to eat at local spots usually but would come back. ��They run a good establishment.
"The stars were raining magic upon the quaint fa�_ade of a hidden map that alluded my new candy-eyed boy and a confused cab driver all looking for our destination: enchantment at the Violet Hour.After all of this time, where have you been all my life sweet illustriousness ubiquitous hub of de-lishnus, oh sweet Violet Hour?No, but seriously, it was really raining when we came. ��Cats and dogs and sheeps and cattles, if you catch my drift lol. ��But that's Chicago for you. ��Never a dull moment in this windy city. ��Luckily, my candy-eyed boy thought to bring an umbrella. ��He's not usually a thinking man.... Upon the heavenly cessation of our bumpy cab ride, we arrived at the knowers-only entrance gala to the Valhalla of fancy drinks. ��The wait was unbearable. ��But after a glance at the supernatur"
"A friend of mine brought me here, or else I don't know how I would have found out about it but I'm glad I did! All the staff was super friendly and attentive.We had beers because we were in the mood, but I have heard the wines are excellent and wouldn't doubt it. The beers we're top notch, really flavorful imports.They serve breakfast all day, which is an added bonus for a breakfast lover like me. They have a lot of great options though. Definitely one of those places where everyone will be able to find something they like!"
"Best pan pizza in Chicago, hands down."
"Crazy awesome. I've been here four times and each visit is just as great. Service is great and the food is killer. I'd like to note that the cuisine is a modern take on classics. On that note, I want to point out that the Puerto Rican rice is not authentic. The taste and texture isn't close. I know because I was born and raised boricua.Other than that, spectacular."
"I did not know what to expect from this restaurant - I've heard that the restaurant itself looks like any other 'ordinary' building, without the name blazing about. They have valet, but you can find parking a few blocks away (non-permit). You enter the restaurant, and you walk down a short corridor that has purple lighting, and enter to your left. You are greeted by literally 5-7 men, dressed in suits, asking you the same question - 'How are you doing this evening?'. We were seated in the dining area on the ground level, a booth with some comfortable cushions. The waitstaff seems very particular in the placement of your beverages, and cleans up with a damp towel of any morsel or droplet of liquid that gets on the surface of the table. I tried the Green Tea/Grapefruit/Laven der, which was l"
"TThis clean and comfortable family owned restaurant is a Chicago gem. It's fresh menu and wood fired pizzas are wonderful. ��We ordered and ap ��off the menu and a special.

"I went to Crisp the first day they opened way back when and went again a couple of weeks ago. It's not authentic Korean per se, it's really more American with Korean influence or very Americanized Korean food. On my recent visit, the fried chicken was good, but very greasy, memorably greasy as compared to the food on my first visit. It's a clean, small place with picnic tables and decent food, but nothing totally spectacular. I think they were more attentive to detail and customer service when they first opened, with personalized attention from the owner regarding food quality at that time."
"First of all, Pequod's serves the best pizza I've ever had- in Chicago or anywhere. ��The caramelized crust (it's not burnt, people) on the deep dish pizza is what makes them unique so don't even think about ordering thin crust. ��Also, if it is your first time, you'll want to go in and try it fresh, not delivered. It is worth pointing out that the Pequod's deep dish is different from other chicago-style pizza like Giordano's or Lou Malnatti's. ��This isn't stuffed pizza, it is more traditional- but again, it's all about the crust. ��For me, nothing beats the topping combination of pepperoni and pepperoncini. ��They smother the pie with toppings so I don't recommend going crazy with a lot of different toppings. ��The restaurant itself can get pretty busy, especially on the weekends. ��If you have"
"If anyone compares this place to Kumas they just don't know food; or should find something better to do than write reviews on Yelp! ��The space is a dump; the burgers and fries are no better than I can make myself (and I can barely fry an egg); and the service is non-existent. ��How in the world can you compare this place to Kumas?!?!? ��Did your mouth and eyes die prematurely? ��Come on people! ��We're living in one of the best food towns on the planet Earth! ��This town is getting diluted by people that don't have the same orientation for food as the people that have made it famous through creating it! ��Maybe this is another reason we're called the Second City (on our way to the Third, Fourth or Fifth)!"
"My group had their holiday outing there yesterday and it was very disappointing. ��The food and service were terrible! ��The sushi was not fresh, the beef was too chewy and the miso soup was too salty. ��Several were also disappointed with the rock shrimp and sea bass dish. ��It took forever for us to place our order and get served each course. ��At times, we felt like the server had forgotten about us. ��Also, they put MSG in their food and do not include that on the menu or tell you unless you ask. ��I'm glad I asked, though almost didn't, cause I'm highly allergic to it. ��It was shocking to me that a place of this caliber that is on the expensive end would even have MSG (a low quality, artificial ingredient) in its food. ��Even Panda Express no longer makes its food with MSG.The waiter was clue"
"I had hear about this place for a while and it did not disappoint when I was finally able to go last week. I took out some clients to lunch and it was a hot day out, but their gorgeous shaded patio did the trick. We enjoyed a lovely lunch and the lovely shade outside."
Typical High End Asian Fusion Menu with a Filipino twist.
Not my favorite place for a hot dog but it has got a second place. Much better in summer time when thwy bring the food to you.
I can't even tell how much I miss this place now that I live in Cali. Love the food and great selection of beer!!!
"I ate at The Purple Pig for the first time (finally) earlier this week with a friend, and I couldn't have been more impressed. We were greeted warmly at the door, and while we were told we had to wait about 30 minutes for our table, the staff was extremely welcoming, and promptly helped us get situated with some wine while we waited. Once seated (about 25 minutes later), we took the liberty of ordering a ton of items from the menu. I don' teat a lot of meat, and while I knew from looking online beforehand that there were several dishes I would be able to enjoy, I had no idea how many until the menu was placed before us...there must have been at least 25 or more items that involved chicken, seafood, veggies and more. A vegetarian could eat very happily here (the corn salad, the beets, and t"
Service isn't always the best but the food is so good who cares. The duck is a must. The hot & sour soup is the best in the city. A meal onto itself. Roast pork is excellent too. The baby bok choy is awesome.There is no place like it in Chicago. Even in Chinatown.
"I love sushi and I love that this place is byob. It's always busy, but the food is delicious. I tried to get a reservation on a saturday and that was a no go- minus one star for that. When we did go, we waited forever for our food. Minus a star for that. The sushi is very delicious and I like the large menu. I'd recommend Coast for date nights, but it's definitely hard to go there with a group."
"I just love this place. The outdoor cafe makes me feel like I'm in a different world. The rest of the stress in my life seems like a million miles away. The food is amazing, different, and appeals to many tastes. I've had group parties and everyone I bring here loves this place. The owners are also very sweet men and every server I've had has been warm and experienced. Can't wait to go back!"
Great food
Visited last night for the first time. ��I have to say that I did place a carry-out order but it was a great experience. ��The owner was wonderful...he made me feel like we knew each other for years! ��Food was ready quickly and was delicious! ��I have found a new place to eat!!! yeah!!!
"WORST BLOODY MARY EVER!!!!If a good bloody mary (or two) is an integral part of your brunch experience, skip Nana. ?Their bloody mary is a simply awful concoction based on ?pablano pepper/pickle juice. ?We discussed it with our server who said that the chef has stubbornly defended this drink in the face of multiple customer complaints saying Why would we want to be like everyplace else? ? ummmmm, maybe because it's better to give people what they want than to make a sucky version of a classic drink. ?Get over how hip you are and offer a classic bloddy as an alternative to your terrible house bloddy mary.The food was good, but overpriced. ?If you go, stick to the main menu and avoid the specials. ? The specials kind of follow the bloody mary experience, the chef showing us how cool they are"
I just visted Sunda last night and let me say it was AMAZING!!! I am not one to venture out of my comfort zone with food but I am glad I did last night. ��I had the duck salad which was to die for. ��The walnut tempora shrimp was a hit as well as the dragon roll. ��Everything was so fresh and the service was surprisingly fast considering it was very crowded. ��I'll def. ��be back again.
"I was born and raised in the South so entr��es such as: ""Shrimp and grits"" or ""Biscuits and gravy "" sets my heart a flutter. Needless to say, I am a poor ��unemployed graduate student and the prices have kept me from venturing over. Having a dinner date last night with some girlfriends gave me the perfect excuse to spend some money that I don't have. First and foremost, the ambiance is A+. Posh indeed. When you first arrive you are blocked off from the diners by a heavy velvet curtain. Only until the hostess has confirmed your reservation are you allowed past the veil. Secondly, the service....A+. Very hospitable and knowledgeable. Answered all of our questions about drinks, entr��es and deserts. The food....here is where I seem to differ from the loyal following of Yelpers who have reviewed "
There aren't enough stars to rate this place. ��One of the best restaurants to eat period!!! Branko is very inviting and is a great person. ��I recommend Little Bucharest 10 fold.
"We recently went for dinner. ��We went early, around 6, and there were not many people there but the place filled up before we had left. ��The waitstaff were very nice and offered suggestions. ��We tried an appetizer also that was very good. ��This was my first time eating Ethiopian and I am not totally hooked, but I think this place served very good food and the price seemed reasonable. Kid Friendly - Yes. ��The waitstaff all talked to our son. ��They assisted with the high chair and made sure he was enjoying himself. ��We went for my sons birthday and they found that out and gave him a free dessert of his choice. ��The place was pretty quiet when we got there and I was a bit worried about our son making noises - but overall everything worked out on this end!"
Oh my God. This has to be one of the best places I have ever had dinner. It's right up there with French Laundry.I went to TRU a couple years ago and never forgot it. The food was amazing and the service is the best! If you have the money you have to go!
"NO TABLE FOR YOU!, YOU CAN EAT ON BARREL! TABLES AVAILABLE AT 10:30 PM OR LATER FOR APPETIZERS. WOULD YOU LIKE ONE COMRADE?It was the worst condescending treatment I have ever encountered. Let me explain. Having going to revolution since it first opened we really only have had good things to say about the food and beer, but that night took the cake. no matter how good the beer may be, we will not be back. Unless Morgan the host leaves or is fired.Arriving we knew it was crowded, so we got two beers at the bar and were prepared to wait for a table to eat. I asked the girl up front and she said I would have to speak with the host morgan. I asked him if we could get on their list for a table. I was interrogated and grilled about my dinning choices like it was the Spanish Inquisition. Are you "
"LOVE IT!!! ��BJ the maitre d' was very intune to the needs of my quests!! ��If you are a fan of southern homestyle cooking, this is the place to go. ��The wait staff are very friendly, sometimes towards the end of dinner- too smothering...kind of a hurry and get out feel. ��Still, I would come back - I've taken four different groups of clients in the last month...so yeah, I'm in love and will continue to support Q!"
"For a time, I had been ordering pizza from Calo (thin crust sausage and onion), but decided to stop because they were too hit or miss on quality. Some days it was excellent, other times it was fair at best. The last time I ordered from them, the pizza was worse than a store-brand frozen pizza, and the delivery man left about 20 menus on my front lawn. There are too many quality pizza places around."
"Lovely, lovely, lovely.My last lunch in Chigcago was the best. My family were a little tierd and not as enthusiastic BUT came around as we were treated well and the food was awsome. Unlike some of our other Chicago dining experiences we had excellent value for the price. All the food was prepared with fresh, quality ingredients. Well done - highly reccomended."
"5 stars for their cakes and desserts , not so sweet , but yet full of flavors . I always order birthday cakes there for my friends but I took off 1 star for their staff -- the girl at the dessert bar was AWFUL , what the hell is wrong with her attitude ?? She seemed like she don'r want to work at all , even tho her only job was to put the cakes in a box for the customers. Anyway, that does not effect my love to their mango mousses cake , lol"
"Best Pizza in Chicago, hands down. I am a pizza lover, so when I was told about Pequod's two years ago I couldn't wait to put it to the test. If I'm out seeing a movie it is at the Webster Theatre which is right across the street, so a pizza and movie night is perfect for me. I have read that some people think they have too much crust, but I disagree. It's delicious and the way it is served, each piece remains hot. Another thing, Pequod's is so reasonably priced. Worth every penny! They will even hold your leftovers for you until you get out of the movie!"
"I've been going to Simply It for over two years and it keeps getting better! I love the fresh ingredients. The recent cooking class was great. ��I know quite a lot about cooking and was surprised to learn some new techniques, sources of ingredients and cultural background about the cuisine. The owner Tuan is very friendly and almost always there."
"As a local come here often; a bit pricey but good mussels and overall good wholesome food. Love it in the winter with the cozy library fireplace area, tin ceilings and festive holiday. Bar areas ( there are two!) are well stocked with beers on tap and Morris, one of the bar tenders, is wonderful!Definitely check it out but remember the tab will be a bit high. Oh on sundays they have bloody marys with beer backs..."
Best falafel in chicago. ��Cash only.
"Apparently popular (by the huge wait), but the sausage stuffed pizza I ordered was bland. ��The sausage had no taste and the sauce was very much lacking. ��I have had better Chicago stuffed pizza in Austin at Mangia's."
"Been there twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. �� As many have said before, the food is indeed great. However, the drink prices are excessive -- even for the location. ��We had a great glass of pinot for $24.00. ��I liked it so much I looked it up after our visit and found it was selling for $21.00 per bottle. ��I felt totally ripped off. ��I understand restraunts make their money off of alcohol, but two beers and two glasses of wine with our meal came to $70.00."
"Have been to Carnivale a few times and always a good experience. ��Great food,service, and ambiance! Highly recommend the guacamole and mojitos."
I have no idea how their steaks are but the Chopped salad is awesome. ��I think it is so funny though that the menu says the salad is big and sharing is recommended- because I can eat the whole thing by myself. ��I mean- it's so good- why wouldn't I finish it?! ��Does that mean that I eat too much?
"This restaurant was GREAT! ��I can't wait to go back! The restaurant itself is realyy fun and beautiful. ��It makes you feel like its a high class restaurant but its a really comfortable atmosphere. ��The food is great and the drinks are too. ��Their raspberry mojitos are deeeeelicious! ��For dinner I had the special, it was a pork dish. ��It was seasoned great and plenty of food, and only $25. ��The server was great too, he knew all about the menu and could explain everything to me. ��It's food like you've never had before and delicious!"
"I went to Mastro's with a client, and will never repeat the experience. ��The restaurant was, as other reviewers mentioned, extremely noisy and very dark. Flashlights were needed to read the menu. ��I ordered the bone-in filet, which was touted by the waiter as one of the signature dishes - it was one of the worst steaks I have had in a long time. ��Dry and tasteless. ��The appetizer and sides were mediocre. ��The service, however, was fine. However, given the prices, one would expect really excellent food, not mediocre to bad."
"We went here on New Year's Eve for dinner but the entire place was closed. ��Went back a few days later and was not impressed. ��I ordered the avocado burrito with melted cheese and sauce on top. ��The burrito was huge and full of avocado's. ��Great for the first bite or two but then it became way to much. ��A trace of beans were found but not enough to offset the avocado. ��The melted cheese was all congealed on the top and resembled a fried egg. ��I am not sure what the sauce was but the color was yellow, very watery and tasteless. ��Prices were good and margaritas too. ��I will go back again but just for drinks. ��Skip the food."
"This still has to be my favorite fondue place. It beats other fondue-me2-restaurants. This was the first place in fact that I tried fondue and fell in love with it. Yes, you definitely come here for the nice wine selection and the yummy food! my favorite is still the cheese and crackers at the bar. I don't know if they still do this - have not been back for a few weeks. I was a sucker for this (while waiting for our table). I recommend the chicken or the chicken and seafood combo. My girlfriend loves the seafood option. In either case, its really good!"
"I am a concierge at a downtown hotel and needed a quick place to bring three guests for lunch. I worked with the manager Kelly here and our experience was fantastic! We were immediate seated and our waiter was great. All were impressed with their lunch special prices, and portions. The cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory was great. Will definitely bring future clients here again, and recommend to hotel guests."
WERE ALL OUT OF STARS HERE WITH THIS ONE!!with the presentation and tastes that delivers with a punch your sure to come back I love this place sushi that we crave the prices are a little high thoe
"There are many items on the menu that I can't even pronounce - well, whatever they were, they were tasty. The only thing I didn't like were some kind of gnocchi... everything else was pretty good."
"nice ambience, awesome tumyum kung, Neau Sa-Ded, Pad see-iew and BYOB is big plus :)"
"I took my girlfriend here for Valentine's Day, and we both loved it. They had a fixed price menu that night, or one could just order from the regular menu, which we did. The cheese and herb croquettes are to die for. An absolute must! I had the catfish pecan, which was excellent, although too many pecans for me. No worries, it was still delish! My girlfriend had the mushroom pasta dish and loved it, too. We were too full for dessert, but got a piece of the red velvet cake to go. As everyone seems to note here, it was wonderful. The service was excellent, even on this very busy night. The atmosphere is casually classy, although nothing really special.When it comes to Southern cooking, I'm more of a New Orleans guy. I didn't have anything here that could compete with the sort of food you can"
"Noisy. Unfriendly. Expensive. That's more than enough to keep any reasonable person away. ��But just one more thing: the ""operating partner"" likes to add ""complimentary"" items to your bill--and stiff you for them at check-out time. It's yet another typical ""high-end"" shakedown in Chicago where the management assumes you'll be too afraid in front of your date to carefully check the bill. Give this plastic, faux Asian dungeon a wide berth. ��But let's end this by saying something nice. ��Sunda. It's a lovely name. It's the name of a group of islands in Indonesia. But this place has about as much in common with Indonesia, its ancient culture and its delicious food as the Taliban have with humanitarianism."
Great food and great atmosphere. Food is a little over priced for the portions.
"BURNT CRUST.Some of you out there will not read any further and think yuk and with any other place you would be right,HOWEVER,the burnt crust on the deep dish pies here is THE reason I have been coming here with my friends for going on 4 years. ��Place can be dingy with meaningless sports/other visual noise staffed by bored barely 21 gum chewers, but all that fades into the periphery once the 20 minute wait is over and the piping hot slab of caramelized cheesy dough is plopped into your waiting maw.Honestly a must-try chicago experience."
Among all the Brazilian steak houses in Chicago this place is the best. �� Service AMeat quality ASalad Bar B +
"All right. ��This is Yelp Review numero uno for me. ��And yes, I registered just so I could review Fogo and give them 5 stars.This place has everything I need to sustain myself: ��Pizza, chicken, salads, and more. ��And everything is incredible.The Pizza: ��Here's the thing. ��Between my roommate and I, at least one of us eats here on any given day. ��We started out joking like, ""all we ever eat is Fogo."" ��Then that joke became the reality. ��Neither one of us has been grocery shopping in a couple of weeks.I have had about 25 varieties of pizza from their slices alone! ��Did you think I was joking about the every day thing? ��This is what keeps me coming back, again and again. ��Thin crust, delicious sauce, and fresh, high quality ingredients. ��I generally get two just because I want to experience tw"
"I have had the pleasure of dining at this Chicago style restaurant over the years. It is always delightful!Recently, we enjoyed our Valentine's day dinner at Kinzi. We arrived and greeted as though they had been waiting for us all night escorting us to a special table as requested.Our server, who was very busy for the special day, made us feel as though we were his only table, making recommendations on both food and wine. We selected the pre-fix Valentine's Day special with wine pairing . Not only beautiful but delicious. All for a noticable and delightful value. Both Susan, the owner and staff could not have made us feel more at home. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!PS - We reconnected with Michelle, the manager, who we knew from a previous restaurant ��and we are thrilled that she found"
Excellent!!!! The owner from the Tea Essence told me about this place which is a block away so I thought I would take my tea and head over. I love the Milanesa Sandwich!!
Outstanding Mexican food. Fresh tortillas and great organic produce.
"my girlfriend and I went here last night. ��I loved everything about this place except for the seating. ��When you are spending over $100 on your meal I would like ��not be rubbing elbows with the table next to me. ��If you are able to get a table for two on the wall or in the booth do it. ��I would have given 5 stars if not for that. ��The service was unreal. ��Our waitress was great. ��The food was awesome. ��I loved the beef and lobster. The cheese fondue was soooo good. By the time dessert came I didn't think I could take another bite but I'm glad i did. ��The coffee was even excellent,"
"We went to La Villa for the first time today and we had a great experience. It was the sort of place my grandparents used to like when I was growing up: dinner comes with soup and salad, free focaccia bread, huge portions. Two managers came by our table to see how we liked our meal, and they were both very friendly."
I went here one evening after work. We were seated very quickly at a nice long table where everybody was able to converse without feeling isolated. The wait staff was extremely pleasant and patient and got all of the orders right. The rock shrimp tempura and the firecracker rolls were the table favorites. And of course the saki was a big hit as well. All in all we had a very nice evening. I would definitely recommend this to anybody interested in an asian fusion restaurant.
Italian ? True italian ?? YES this is what you get here !!! NO American stile pasta but very good authentic Italian food !! Its really yummy and i liked everything !!!!! The pasta was cooked to perfection and served in a very light nice sauce !!Service was very friendly and fun !Only thing is that is so buzzzzy there that it gets kind of noisy- so nothing for a quiet evening.But other than that: i can only very highly recommend it !!!!
"My first review YAY!!!! I'm finally breaking down and writing reviews instead of just using review hehe.This place is right down the street from my apt so my roomie and I went there last night. She had this crazy bowl with an egg on top, I forget the name, and I had a sandwich that was pretty decent. The flavors were different than what I'm used to, but I'm not that adventurous. Hoping to change that now that I'm in Chicago!The employees there were really nice and the communal seating at the long benches was pretty cool. We'll definitely be comng back here."
"My dad is a fan of gangster history so for father's day we tried to take him here. ��There is ALWAYS a cover...to add to that the guy at the door was trying to charge us more than the posted cover on the website! ��I must say, it's kind of sad that a place that has so much infamous history now hosts a weekly poetry slam. ��Al Capone should be rolling in his grave. ��We'll probably try to stop back earlier in the day the next time my dad is in town. ��Overall very disappointed. ��I'll give it 3 stars just because they're still around, in fairly original condition, and they have a great history (even if that can't be attributed to the current owners/employees). ��I hear the music is good...but from what I heard of the poetry I'd avoid this place on Sundays."
"This is my first 5 star review and I haven't been here in about 5 months. ��To me Frontera is like buying a pair of Tory Burch shoes--high quality expectations are met every time. ��I just know that over the years Frontera has never disappointed and my husband and I LOVE to come here for special occasions since it can be pricey and the wait can be long. ��While waiting, I love indulging with gold margaritas. ��But be careful, they are strong and I didn't remember my meal one time. ��Bayless is always walking around the restaurant which I think is so cool! ��Great specials and different dishes. ��I try something new every time and just love it. ��Frontera is certainly my restaurant crush if such thing exists."
This restaurant was awful!!!!!!!! Service was TERRIBLE and RUDE.Food was so so and extremely expensive for what it was.Very noisy and our server was so cold and even nasty to us.Our food was plopped down on the table at various times with no explanations as to what it was. My niece who was the birthday girl fnally got her order when we all had finished!Very disappointed in Mercat.
"I like the lay out, elevated booth's, fireplace, big bar, tons of seating. There house brews are good. ��The crowning achievement is the Seitan sausage Pizza, best Vegan/Veggie pizza around. ��Seitan Sausage is unreal."
Milk and Honey has the best Granola ever!!! ��their service is great and their food is always fresh. ��Really yummy baked goods and delicious oatmeal too. ��Hands down this breakfast place is the best in the neighborhood!
"I'll start by saying that the food at L&E is legit. They have one of the best burgers I've ever had, and an incredible whiskey menu. That being said I have a serious issue with how they run their business. I have a 16 month old child and I don't go out to eat very much anymore but ate at L&E a few months ago while out with a friend for his birthday. Since that night I have been telling my wife about the burger at L&E. Today I stopped in around 4:15 PM to order a couple of burgers to take home. The hostess told me that the kitchen didn't open until 5 PM and I should be able to order my food then, I took a menu and came back at 5. When we returned we were told that they were too busy to make an order for take out at that time. I don't have a problem with them not offering take out (even if i"
"I love this place, it rocks! ��Love the BYOW policy and the steaks, chops and skewers are great....mmmmmm. ��I can go for another date there anytime. ��Staff knows what they are doing."
Stupid place. Never coming again.
"Hi Frank C. You are supposed to put the hot dog in your mouth, not in your rectum. I saw your glowing review on Garibaldi's, the only place that makes a pizza from scratch to taste like a frozen pizza. Give up reviewing food!"
As an American with Romanian friends Little Bucharest is amazingly delicious and equally as comfortable!! The food and service will keep you there and the atmosphere makes you want to keep coming back!
"This place just rocks. Flat out cool o place...thinkin about gettin some pequods panties! Great atmosphere, great pie."
"We were walking through the neighborhood this summer when this restaurant caught my eye. While we only went in for a smoothie, the restaurant owner greeted us warmly and offered us water too. What a sweet little old man! The next time we returned, we didn't have reservations but the wait was not long. The food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. ��I am a big fan of BYOB restaurants that provide a warm and cozy atmosphere and this place certainly attracts a cool and casual, yet sophisticated crowd. Since then I've taken out-of-town guests there, and have used their delivery service as well. This is the perfect place for a warm get-together and a true neighborhood gem."
"Back in July I picked up my boyfriend one night from work (he works nearby in the neighborhood) and he told me the guys at his work rave about this place so we thought we would give it a shot......BIG MISTAKE....We get there at about 11pm and we were the ONLY ones in the place. We place our orders (2 steak tacos for me) (steak burrito for him). After we placed our order we took a seat while our food was being made and in walks ��about 7 wannabe gangsta cholos, probably 18 or 19 years old. ��basically they were flirting with the 2 girls behind the register (also probably 18 or 19) every other word out of there loud mouths were f bombs and it was starting to get really annoying...Besides that, i look at the time and start getting a little impatient with the food taking so long seeing it as it "
"This is a must dine restaurant. After we saw the this restaurant on television and its ratings, we knew we wanted to give it a try. Well, after dining tthis evening, this restaurant is a place we will visit and will dine with family and friends. They have great service, music, food and truly displays a true Cuban decor."
"Talk about the cutest little Italian place! And BYOB!!!I used to live a few block from this place and I feel so lucky! This place is perfect (though the amount of plants they have in the window is a little strange). I love the atmosphere here--it's just so cozy. As long as you don't mind overhearing the conversations of other tables, since you will be sitting relatively close to table next to you. Ask your waiter about the special or recommendations--they love to tell you about their favorites, and they're always right because it's ALWAYS good. When in doubt, get the gnocci."
Sparse decor. Amazing bourban and beer list. Delicious foods (that I've tried)I've come several times for beer and made-with-love cocktails. And now for the patio (can't wait for the beer garden) ��But I had not tried the food untill recently. I've heard mixed reviews from friends about the small portions and lack-luster flavor. But when I tried the catfish with collard greens I was amazed! Delicious. Slightly pricey though. I guess that's how it is at a hot new place!
"Texas de Brazil looks like a kindergarten compared to this place. Fogo de Chao is absolutely the best Brazilian steak house in Chicago. (At least I think so) Extremely good service, amazing meat and tasty potato salads!. What could be better?PS You can smell the meats a block away."
"Food was really good. Waitress was charming, helpful, accommodating and top-notch. Idiot in charge of seating customers was beyond rude.We made reservations for 5:30. My son and I arrived at 5:28. In front of me, Angela D. (who wrote her own review earlier) was greeted saying she also had a 5:30 reservation. She was meeting a friend. The host informed her that she would be sitting at a lovely table about six inches from her left hip, but it was their policy not to seat incomplete parties. Then I told him I had a reservation for three and my husband was on the way. He said we'd be sitting at the lovely table six inches to my right. Now, because the place is about as big as your average suburban master bedroom, there is no waiting area. So she and I and my son stood in the doorway, waiting f"
"Went to Frontera last Friday night after 8pm and waited over two hours to get seated at a table. ��Not a problem if there is actually that many peope in front of you, but if 20 groups listed AFTER your name on the list get seated before you, then something fishy is going on. �� Yes, they told me it would be 1-1.5 hours, but if we were 3rd on the list after an hour and first on the list after an 1 1/2 hours with people coming and going, then you be the judge. I guess if you want to be seated any quicker, be prepared to know someone working there or to grease some palms. ��I've been to Mexican restaurants in Mexico and across the USA. ��Some restaurants may be worth waiting at for that long, but this place definitely isn't one of them.The drinks are good, the entree's are average, waiter service"
"On december 27, 2011 my family and my father that just came from Costa Rica went to your restaurant located in Jackson. Sorry to say but we had the worst meal ever and it was not about the food. It was due a little complain about the pizza we ordered. We order the veggie without broccoli and we get the pizza with the broccoli plus the 45 minutes to get the order completed. The waitress said that she talked to her manager and that he will replace the pizza. After a while, she came back saying that if we agree, the pizza will be off the bill instead, so we agreed. At that time we still had a good time. When the bill came, I signed the voucher without noticing the amount. The pizza was charged. I talked to the manager and he said that he did not approved anything and he directly said that we "
Awesome. ��What a great restaurant. ��It's owned by the Cheesecake Factory and has the same style as that. ��The menu is large and the portions are huge- the food is delicious. ��They have great salads and sandwiches and my favorite is the cedar planked salmon or the Portobello Burger- that is amazing! ��They also have this chocolate souffl dessert that is so worth it- but you need to order it with your meal because it takes so long to make. ��Worth it!
"I love Mia Francesca, it is always a pleasure to go to this always packed restaurant. I love the ambiance, the service is excellent, it is affordable and the food is delicious. I love how the menu changes week to week. My favorites on the menu are the asparagus salad, all the pastas you get there are fantastic and the fish is never disappointing. They now have a back room by the patio that is so quaint and cute it would be perfect for a small intimate party. ��If you can ask to sit out there when you make your reservation it is a different ambiance from the inside- more romantic."
"Great restaurant! ��I went here with a big group of people. ��We forgot to bring our own wine and when we asked for a liquor store the manager/owner? insisted that he would send someone out to get it for us. ��Later, we went through one bottle of wine and he sent someone again to get us another!! ��great service - food was delicious. I had the catfish bowl - so many lovely flavors."
"I haven't seen Top Chef before, so I am not as enchanted as others by the chef's personality, but Sprout received some good reviews, and I decided to give it a try. ?Reservations were easy and we were seated immediately. ?The atmosphere was a bit stale. ?It appeared that they were going for upscale, and it was fine (dark wood, white tablecloths, brick...) but no one seemed to really be enjoying themselves. ?Even the servers were a bit robotic. ?This place needs some personality.I came for dinner with a friend, and we both made sure to order different things so that we could try more dishes. ?I wasn't bothered by the cryptic menu as others have mentioned. ?I kind of like the element of surprise, and don't have an aversion to much. ?If you are a foodie, you will understand the ingredient lis"
I've been to 4 crepe restaurants in Chicago and this is my favorite. ��I enjoy the middle eastern decor and the staff has always been excellent. ��I loved the Palace Crepe so much that I've never bothered trying any of the other crepes that they serve even though they all look delicious!
"This place is aswesome! ��Food is as good as Le Colonials but for about 1/4 of the price. ��They are so nice and so gracious and they really appreciate their customers. ��Aside from that, the food is amazing. ��We love their Salmon and Curry Chicken. ��They deliver also. ��They deliver very fast and always give us fruit. We love Simply It. ��If you are looking for an inexpensive place to dine and bring your own wine, you really should try this amazing place!"
"We ate at Alinea on February 19. From our first interaction with the staff to the final goodbye this was an experience totally out of the ordinary. The service was outstanding, the wine pairing creative and fun. The food was surprising, fun, creative and innovative. We didn't love every single one of the 17 'courses' but all of them were well thought out and brilliantly executed. We got a tour of the kitchen which was great and the 4 hours that we spent here were worth every penny. There are a few restaurants in the world that operate at this high level and we felt really fortunate to live in a city that houses a restaurant like this. Alinea really has to be experienced."
"Shaw's made my BIRTHDAY today. We didn't have reservations for brunch, but Virgil made an exception and sat us since it was my special day. ��I go back and forth between Shaw's and Joe's as my favorite... but Shaw's went over and above. ��Food is always exceptional, service amazing.... GO LEYE."
Good sushi. Green curry and drunken noodle quite good. Andaman salad disappointing. ��Price is high for what you get.
"Poor restaurant. The vareity of the menu is not ok for me, someone who knows greek kitchen. Most of the dishes are actually Turiksh food, but sold as greek. Not recommended."
Why is it so hard to find Greek places like this??? ��I loveeeeee Greek Islands!! ��From the bread and spread to the flaming cheese to the okra to the lamb chops to the dessert... it's a delectable meal from start to finish. ��I make sure I go here every time I visit Chicago!
Wonderful ! ��I really enjoyed the quaint-ness. ��The food was good and affordable. ��I love the cafe style of it. ��The menu is quick and the staff was super nice.
"I registered here specifically to review Nana, and I can describe my Nana experience in just one word. FANTABULOUS! ��But, I'll go further. ��A friend recommended that I visit Nana, since she loved it, so I did and I'm glad that I did. ��Met some friends from out of town this past week and we all had a wonderful time. ��I loved the decor, I loved the service and I absolutely loved the food. ��Everything was fresh. The waitress knew the dishes and the ingredients just perfectly. �� I will be going back for sure. ��Thanks Nana...you guys rock!"
"Mmmm...what a fantastic and wonderful place! Excellent atmosphere and top-notch food. Every menu item is amazing, and the food is high quality and oh so delicious!!! I highly recommend stopping by this place for breakfast or brunch. You will be glad you did!"
"Although I've only had Indian food a handful of times, the food was delicious. I do not really know what I ate, but I would highly recommend sampling small portions of food. Luckily, I went with a friend so I was able to be guided through their different selections. The buffet is not the cheapest, but I thought the quality was more than fair so I had no objection to it. The service was more than decent. One highlight was the guy who refilled my water. I made a mess with their mango ice cream (?) because at the time I served myself, it was already melting and overfilled my cup. I got it all over my hands and it made my hands orange. He was really nice and brought me more napkins. I would definitely go again."
"Lunch Specials are very nicely priced. ��My wife and I love coming here on Friday nights. ��The clay pot chicken, avocado chicken, and plum tea are our favorite dishes! ��The service is attentive and pleasant. ��The owners are friendly and always looking to please. ��I recommend this spot, especially if you work @ Children's Memorial."
One of the best in Chicago. Downthread there is a one star review. You should ignore it as the reviewer was not at Sun Wah. He claimed he ordered a martini - no drinks served at Sun Wah just beer. ��I have a feeling he was at Wah Sun which is a completely different restaurant - not related ��in any way.
"I love this place. ��Read a few negative reviews, and was a bit hesitant, but after going there, I can't figure out why people are complaining! ��The atmosphere is great, the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable and they mix up one heck of a drink! �� Amazing!"
"Comfort food was never so good. From macaroni and cheese to popcorn, everything exceeded my expectations. Very young atmosphere including the service, however they are extremely helpful and friendly. By the time our meal concluded I felt as though I had picked up a few more friends within the people that worked there.Aside from the service though, all the food was delicious and provided an unexpected twist on classic American favorites.Graham Elliot definitely puts his own take and speciality ��into each dish and it shines through not only while you're there but after you leave as well."
"Great food. ��Great dessert. ��Legit prices. ��My friend Mikey told me to go see Sado, who is a server there. ��And he was so nice and helpful! ��This place is amazing. ��The arrangement and decorating sets a nice relaxed mood."
"This place is awesome! ��It's my favorite stop for coffee on the way to work in the morning. ��The staff is all really friendly and quick. ��I moved to the city a couple months ago and after about my fourth visit one of them knew my drink. ��They also have free wifi if you're hanging out for a while, and a nice outdoor sidewalk area in the summer. ��Great alternative to the Starbucks down the street."
"This is easily one of my new favorite pizza shops. ��It's got these amazing experimental slices like the cesar salad slice, the taco slice and the barbecue and they are all delicious. ��I personally enjoy the tomato and chicken and the sicilians with the sauce on top. ��The prices are ridiculously cheap for the quaility of food. ��The service can use an improvement but with food this good...come on"
best hot dogs ever...
"We brought a group to celebrate a friends engagement and had a great time. Starting with the bartender and ending with the valet, everyone was fiendly and fun. The food wad excellent and the desserts were enormous."
"I took a date here and had a great experience.Firstly, I had no idea how huge it was! Also i was under the impression it was less casual than it is, I really liked the interior. Food was excellent, and well timed. ��The wine was affordable and they ad a surprisingly large selection from what I remember, we had a great time at the front bar area also, margaritas and mojitos were excellent."
"Good foods, great service. ��Lobster is delicious. ��They sure know how to treat people. ��A must for everyone."
"Overall the food at Mercat a la Panxa exceeded my expectations. We ordered the mixed cheese, chorizo, escalivada (roasted peppers, eggplant, and confit tomatos), and the butternut squash dumplings. The mixed cheese plate had a nice balance of cheeses. It was served with three different sauces. The goat's milk cheese with dolce de lecce I didn't feel was the best compliment but it went really well with the apples so I can see what they were going for. The butternut squash dumplings were absolutely the highlight with the escalivada as a close runner up. The chorizo was good as well but didn't blow me out of the water by any means. We were also served a complimentary flat bread tapa that was similar to a bruschetta. Very delicious. The wine selection although limited to Spain varietals was go"
"This place is so perfect if you are out on Michigan Ave to shop downtown, no matter what time of year it is, however, during the winter there are always the fond memories of the snow blowing outside.The deepdish pizza here is top-notch, using the cornbread crust, amazing sauce and the best cheese you can find on a pizza. Don't be surprised if you try to shove one extra slice in your stomach more then you can handle and leaving the place feeling like you just finished Thanksgiving dinner.No matter which toppings you like on your deepdish, they are sure to serve it the best, however I personally prefer just cheese deepdish pizza.Filling with a great atmosphere where you can write on the walls, you will be wanting to come back months and years later to try to find your mark on the establishme"
"This restaurant was incredible! ��I had Bone Marrow which is a rare delicacy, Rack of Lamb for the entree, and Creamed Spinach as a side dish. ��All were incredibly yummy. ��I also went nuts for the complimentary bread that included pretzel bread!Atmosphere was great - the band music was a wee loud in the bar area, but it faded in and out. ��Staff was highly attentive and very patient in describing their specials. ��Our meal (party of 3) was about $300 (which includes the tip). ��Save up and come here - it's well worth the treat ��:)"
"Bridgeport could not ask for anything better than Nana's....... I finally get a cafe i can chill at 2 blocks away from home... its about time Bridgeport is upgrading for the better with great diners like this place....The price is a bit pricey but i still give it 5 stars, because people have to realize the food is ORGANIC.... You will spend tons even if you shop at ORGANIC WHOLE FOODS....."
I love this place. I've been there twice and it's a really romantic place. It's a little pricey but worth it.
We had Saturday brunch and the brunch choices were fabulous. ��Food and service were exceptional but what I had expected. ��Be there right at 10:30 and you will get a table right away. ��We will go again.
"The best eats in Chicago (Sorry, Charlie Trotter). Those of us who waited forever for Doug to re-open are not disappointed. Doug's culinary combinations are spot-on. I have never had a bad meal here. I even got one of the last foie gras laced offerings (Quack, Quack, or is it Honk, Honk). This stuff is what carnivores were made for. Doug, don't change a thing. Please don't franchise, sell out, expand or change the decor. Your public needs you behind the counter."
"Bacon wrapped Dates, Estrella Damm, thanks for the cheese!"
"Thank God for the Midwest...and Italians. ;) ��Only here would this sort of pizza chain have the appetite to down slice after slice of the stuffed goodness known as Giardano's world-famous. ��(In LA, for example, people would be more likely to vomit afterward--not necessarily due to bulimia, but because their bodies aren't used to being abused by the elements and self-indulgence like here. ��And frankly, the value for sinly delecacies is not the same...so I digress.)My favorite/standard pick is the Special with garlic (extra), not to outshine, however, the 3-cheese or even the shrimp (albeit an unusual experience the first go around). ��Whatever your pleasure--pizza, pasta or otherwise, Giardano's is a rare American treat.I will certainly be back. ��Hope you come to your senses too. ;)"
worth the long wait in line.
Absolutely wonderful!!! I was born in italy and still visit once a year. I mean it truly when i say their ingredients are some of the best in the city. The combinations you will find here are the same you might over in italy. They don't like their pizza to travel and i like that. much like great lakes pizza just down the way they have a respect for their craft. the fact is that their pizza is meant to eat immediately.
Greek Islands has great food and excellent service!! Some of the best Greek food in Chicago! My family and I always go there when we're in the mood for authentic Greek dishes. Convenient Valet service or parking lot directly across the street. Friendly staff. Pleasant atmosphere.
"My co-worker and I picked up lunch from Nuevo Leon today and took it back to the office. ?I got enchiladas verdes with ground beef (picadillo). ?On my second bite I discovered, to my horror, a cockroach inside the enchilada. ?It wasn't small, about 3/4 of an inch long, and completely intact save for an antennae that I fear I might have eaten in the first bite. ?We called the restaurant and told them what happened. ?They said we could bring the food back and get a refund. ?They did not apologize on the phone; nor did they offer an apology after we drove back to the restaurant. ?We walked in and the manager was at the register waiting for us. ?I said we called. ?Without a word he took the food and walked away. ?The cashier gave us our money back and that was it."
"I'm normally not that into food preparation and all that jazz, but this impressed me its almost worth all the reservations pains. They've got some really weird dishes, but well executed, you'd think there was these dishes made up from long ago. Well made, weird dishes is what I can say. Quail Egg Ravioli = win."
"It's fabulous. I went to Bin 36 for dinner with a group of friends and we were all impressed. I love wine and cheese (who doesn't?) and Bin 36 exceeded my expectations. Overall we had great service, wine, and our dinners were delicious. The restaurant was too loud but did not negatively impact our experience. I would definitely go back."
"I purchased a Groupon to Las Tablas a couple of weeks ago since I wanted to treat a Colombian friend to a nice dinner. I drove 45 miles to the city and when we arrived at 4pm on Saturday, we saw a noticed on the window indicating that they only accept Groupon with a reservation. The restaurant was almost empty at the time, but they would not give us a reservation saying that they only accept a limited amount of Groupons per day and they have already met their daily limit based on current reservations. We had a drink at the bar and watched the soccer game, but decided to dine somewhere else. Granted, the Groupon said to call for reservation and mention the Groupon, but it never indicated that they only accepted a limited amount of Groupons per day."
Awesome rice and beans. ��Best South American joint on the North side. ��Don't let your eyes get bigger than your stomach here- big portions for cheap!
"It's like walking into your family's place, but veggie/vegan. Everything on the menu is interesting and great. It's an old building, with character and life contained within it's walls. Oh the story's it could tell. They have been around so long, pioneers of sorts. They are part of the solution people. They walk the walk and talk the talk. Maybe some of you should do the same. Thanks for all of the years TCD. Much Love!"
"Hands down my favorite Italian place in Chicago. The food on the changing menu is always excellent; more often than not I find myself struggling to decide between 2 or 3 of the dishes when choosing my order. The pasta itself is flavorful and cooked perfectly--never mushy. The establishment is usually loud and sometimes packed to the gills, but it never gives off a cramped or obnoxious feel. Service is good, friendly. A favorite place to go with friends to laugh or treat out-of-towners to a great meal."
"Coming from someone who has been here several times before, I was very upset to notice such a terrible difference in quality. I was being nice when I gave it one star. The service was good and thats about it!.. It's called Shaw's CRAB HOUSE! ?So why was it when I went their for brunch the Crab was the WORST thing I had. Great bloody Mary, Good beef, and turkey, Bacon was way above average. However this is not why i went to Shaw's CRAB HOUSE I went for the crab! Highly Disappointed and will never go back!"
We started with giant lima beans and tuna. ��Next we had the fried pigs feet cakes and delicious fried brussel sprouts. ��We finished with milk braised pork shoulder and mashed potatoes. ��It was all excellent and the atmosphere was fun and friendly.
"I will admit that the food was pretty good, and the portions were generous. ��However, I didn't appreciate the attitude from our server. ��She made me feel like I was from outer space or something. ��Because I spoke Spanish? ��I'm from Mexico, of course I speak Spanish!"
"The Chicago Diner. Best Veggie Restaurant in the city, hands down. They do everything right from Gyros to Ruebens. The fresh juices and smoothies are also delicious. One need not be a vegetarian or vegan to appreciate the cuisine, and if I could eat there everyday I would have no problem swearing off my carnivorism."
"in two words,tourist trap! I waited 20 years to eat here , the food was nothing to write home about,the margaritas were great,the waiter was aloof staring into the street when we were ordering.Everyone I talked was a first timer. I would not reconmend."
"This place is outstanding! I have already gone twice! The food is amazing. IF you are driving on Armitage, you might miss it since there are no signs on there... a hidden gem and you need reservations. I went there with a party of 6 and the food was great. We had 7 courses and the service was great as well! Plan on going at least 2times a year since their menu is always changing! OH and it is BYOB even better!"
"More like a 3.5 stars. Food was good, but pricey for my pairings on this type of cuisine which I believe I've had better. Realistically I've been there twice and of the times I've gone there it's been so busy, crazy, and packed and overly loud that I found myself screaming to talk to my guest. lol I didn't think it was the best spot to go if you're looking for a romantic getaway. However, I would recommend, I have bias opinions."
"I used to eat hear frequently in the 80's/90's and felt it was one of the best kept secrets in the city. The last few times I have been there it has been too busy (usually special occasions i.e. Valentine's, Father's Day etc.), so many not be that way on normal days. The portions had gotten very small and may have lost a little luster in taste."
"For a beer lover this place is meca. It has beers from all over the world served in specialty glasses to make them as tasty as they can be.For beer lovers who dont have a bottomless wallet however this place is a the ultiamate tease. $8 beers, $15 pictures (not everything is this expensive) is sadly not for everyone. The place itself is great though. It's got the feel of your favorite neighbood bar, and the bartenders are friendly and knowageable."
"This place is good, but not exactly a huge fan. The price is a bit high relative to the service and quality of food. I would rather go to local restaurants and pay about half. Rick's flagship restaurant is damn good and worth every penny, but XOCO is simply nothing impressive. It's good food, but nothing impressive. This might have been like a hyped up movie... good, but didn't live up to the expectations."
hands down one Chicago's icon authentic Mexican restaurants in the citygood cheap no thrills authentic mexican food + byoba must for a place to feed friends and or family for less.
"Pizza : ��Good, but not the best, not even in the top 10 in Chicago. ��I was disappointed because I was expecting awesome pizza. ��I guess I'm not accustomed to East Coast Pizza. �� You do get generous portions however. ��The salads are huge, which is a plus. Beer: ��Very good. ��Specials througout the weekService: ��GoodOn the downside. ��Trafic is congested and parking is horrible. ��Hey, it's Wicker Park, ��what are you going to do."
Came here for drinks late at night and loved their specials. Their food tasted so good! I loved the atmosphere. The server was really quick and she served great drinks all night long! Great servings. Great place to go hangout with groups! We had about 8 of us.TRY THE CHEESE CURDS!
"I really enjoyed Bin 36. I must say the big open space is really cool. I'm a novice to wine but i enjoy it, so we let the waiter guide us with which flights of wine to try. The waiter also suggested a cheese flight to go with the wines, and everything was great. There are so many wines and cheeses there you would have to go there a bunch of times to try them all. ��Great place to go after work with a group of friends. My group had a great time and will be going back soon."
OMG! Talk about the best authentic taco's in Chicago! I am a big fan of Check Please which comes on Channel 11. I have found out about a lot of GREAT reastaurants watching that channel and LaPasadita is on of them! It's a drive but ��WORTH THE TRIP!!! I love SPANISH food period...MiTierra is a really nice place as well they an extenive menu and great live music!!!
"Hands down the BEST Indian food in Chicago. ��The flavors are excellent and the heat level is perfect for a variety of tastes. ��They start you off with this tangy, creamy, tomato-based sauce for dipping with pieces of soft, fresh naan. ��So delicious it is making my mouth water just thinking about it. ��I love the samosa's and all the chaupati corner (Bombay street fare) items. ��Not many places can get the tamarind chutney just right with the perfect blend of sweet and tangy with nice consistency. ��This is the best I have found. ��The menu items are delicious, and you can't go wrong with the buffet either. ��The buffet food is kept fresh and warm unlike other places with dried out, overheated, old food. ��The mango lassi is again the best I have ever had. ��Sometimes, I like to get it as my desse"
"Delicious pizza, the best I've had ever. ��They brew their own beer, which was quite nice by the way. ��Dessert wasn't the best (I had the Sundae, which I've made better myself. ��I was not pleased at all as it was very bland).Expect a long wait because this place is extremely popular. ��We waited 20 minutes to be seated. ��The woman who took our name for the waiting list was not friendly at all. ��Our waiter was very friendly and attentive even though the place was packed. ��We went there for dinner and from what I've learned that's the busiest time to go.A tad pricey, but I'd say the pizza was worth the price, and waiting."
"Dear Irazu, I have been loyal to you for years and I love you're food. BUT I ordered the Chicken Tico last night (my favorite and also what I always order) and I was very disappointed when I saw the chicken. You changed it to a chewy flat piece of salty meat?? Why would you do that? The old way was so much better. The chicken used to be like butter... now it's just pathetic. :( I hate to be this harsh but I really want my favorite meal in the city back to normal. I would normally rate you with 5 stars, but after my dinner last night, I can't. Thank you."
"Not bad at all. But not the most amazing of Mexican food. They definitely hook it up on quantity for the price, but ultimately the quality could be better. It's all just a bit bland. The licuadas, however, are ridiculously badass. Try those for sure."
"Hands down the worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant.The first mishap was when they overcharged my delivery bill by $40. In order to be reimbursed, they made me bring in a printed-out bank statement, then made me wait 20 minutes while they sorted it out, and finally told me, ""Meh, it happens.""The second time was when a snide host told my party we needed to leave so they could seat other people -- on a slow night, only 10 minutes after we had finished our meal, paid a generous tip, and were still enjoying our wine.I do not recommend this place at all. The hosts are combative, and the service is absolutely appalling."
First Impression:I had heard a lot about this place and had big expectations but the decor was not what I expected. ��Fun and not stuffing. ��Outside had several nice table but the street was sort of loud. ��Drinks:Limeade- yummy!Food:We had lunch and it was great. ��We started with the cheese and chorizo dish was good but not good for you. ��This was followed by entrees. ��I had the Pescado en Mole Verde de Pepita. ��This was served with swordfish which I am not a big fan of. ��The waiter said he would see if they could substitute Maui Maui but when it came out it was swordfish. ��It was good but I was a little disappointed. My husband had the Puerco Oaxaqueno which was very good but simpler in flavor then expected. ��We finished with the flan duo which was yummy.I wished we had ordered the Cervich
"I've been twice to this resteraunt and nothing really surprised me. ��I love Persian food, and after these two visits I am not wowed. ��I also went to alibaba on foster and a small little resteraunt impressed me more than this. ��Fix you waiters noon and your dill rice"
"I really love this place. ��Its real, its authentic and most of all its intimate."
Great service and excellent food. ��They go out of their way to accommodate ones needs. ��You get a great value for your money at this place. ��The owner is always there to greet ��you and make sure you have an outstanding experience. ��Definitely a must go to. ��ENJOY!!!
"Love love love this place! Sushi always tastes so fresh. I like trying their specials every time I go there. I've tried their food delivery service too, and they don't disappoint. I strongly recommend this place for sushi, sashimi, makis and good times!"
"Similar to the below comments, a friend and I anxiously anticipated the opening of Rev Brew Co since we heard of them coming to the neighborhood. Besides, who couldn't resist checking out a place with their own Gonzo fist-like beer taps! We finally got in last night and it was a damn good experience. We were told an hour and 15 minute wait for a table which was fine because we were able to grab a beer at the bar. After enjoying a Eugene porter and an Iron Fist pale ale, respectably, and stepping out for a cig, we were escorted to our table. 45 minutes - not bad at all. So we had to try the Bacon Fat Popcorn, which seems gimmicky, but it was another reason we wanted to check the place out in the first place. It was alright and I recommend ordering it just for the experience. I also ordered "
"I was excited to finally try this restaurant that I'd heard for so long was a good place to get hot noodle soup but was so disappointed. ��The interior and restaurant itself is what it is, which is okay, but the food was unacceptably bad. ��We ordered a shrimp noodle dish that was cold and had no flavor whatsoever. ��My seafood egg noodle soup had 3 pieces of seafood. ��The beef noodle soup had a strange flavor profile and frightening red color. ��The egg rolls were thin and the diced ingredients were mushy. ��The pan-fried noodles are inedible and tasted more deep-fried than pan-fried and have very few ingredients aside from the fried noodles. ��The only good dish we had, which was actually pretty good, was the pork chop. ��The bubble drinks also tasted like the fruit was not fresh. ��I love Vietn"
They don't answer their phone. ��Tells you all you need to know about their service here. ��Can't imagine eating at a place like that.
Table is too small for 4Wine was warmNo bread to soak up saucesWaiter tried to push us through dinner to turn the tableGreat bar but way over rated as a restaurantHave a burger!
"Being a part time Vegan this place is a like a little piece of heaven. Amazing dishes, quick and friendly service. Every employee seems like they truly care and believe in the restaurant. I'm so glad we have this delightful cafe in Chicago."
"This place is really weak. ?Our server served us a larger size than we ordered, the pizza took forever, and their award winning beer must have been judged by a panel of 18 year olds. ?Our server didn't even know if THEIR beer was an ale or a lager. ? The whole place was like -- rookie!"
Great food the cornbread steaks (ribeye Parmesan Crusted) and shrimp appetizer are among the best entrees my wife had the salmon but I have to say the steak was much better. Was a little pricey but what a great meal
"The pizza is okay but I've had better at some of the other pizza joints in Chicago. My family and I got extremely excited to see Toasted Ravioli on the menu...however, they were filled with cheese-- not beef! (Which would have been nice to know before we ordered them) Our server was not friendly at all.... he didn't seem interested in us at all and we constantly had to ask for our drinks to be refilled. Basically any other pizza place in Chicago is better than Gino's East or maybe just this particular location."
"Best deep dish and thin crust in Chicago. I discovered this place by word of mouth I haven't stopped going. If you like a sausy deep dish with a crusty cheesy edge, then you have to try it out. If you are a meat lover on your pizza, then you have to try the sausage. Although the place looks small on the outside. There is plenty of room for a large gathering upstairs.Whether you are a local or out of town-er, you have to stop by and try Pequods."
"The dessert was great, but the rest was average or less.The service is awful, but it is written in big at the entrance that you shall leave 20% tip or they will include it in your bill.I am from Canada and was eating with my Texan colleague. ��The waitress was quick to pick up my accent and clumsily let me know at the end that Canada is considered like Europe, meaning : they don't tip. ��So she was telling me how stingy her Canadian customer were usually.I have never been treated so badly before. ��This restaurant, beside being average and way overreated, left me disgusted and insulted."
"Absolutely fantastic.. Amazing selection on the menu... Quirky, fun staff.. Fun location, too.. Every time I'm in the area, I demand to stop here. Only regret? They took off the wheatloaf sandwich. Kudos on the gyros though!!OH, and try the mashed potatoes!! You would never ever guess the gravy is vegan!"
"Love it, love it, love it. The food is great and there is always some to enjoy the next day. For the price maybe the best italian in the city. The only downside is it is not a hip place, maybe take your parents."
"I am thoroughly addicted. ��The ribeye sausage with chimmi-churri is phenomenal. ��Ditto for the spicy pork hot link with the coca cola barbecue sauce. ��Any bacon sausage is well, bacon...how could it be bad, and the combinations of flavors Doug comes up with are really delectable. Yes, the lines are long...go early, but if you find yourself in a long line, don't fret...it moves fast, even my 2 year old can handle the wait. ��Try to eat there, as the fries tend to get steamed on the way home. ��And as for the fries, I am not a big fan usually, but I could eat an entire basket of the duck fries myself."
"I'll take this place over Charlie Trotters any day. ��While I don't like to eat this way, it's as comfortable and approachable place as you get for this type of crazy dining!"
"Highly recommend the Grand Lux Cafe. ��I went here with my family to celebrate, they don't take reservations, but we only had to wait 15 minutes when we got there at 5:30 on a Saturday night. ��The atmosphere is fun, the service was phenomenal and the food was very delicious! They have very large portions, so I ended up taking over half my food home. ��It was a GREAT experience!"
Went here with my boyfriend for my birthday. I felt the whole this was mediocre. ��The food portions were kinda small. ��We got the calamari and the gnocci. Werent really impressed and the service was also good but not outstanding. I probably wouldnt go back again but it was not bad.
"OMG! If you crave OX tails, you have to go to 90 MILES CUBAN CAFE. ��If you don't crave OX tails and you go there...get the OX tails. ��The yummiest, best cooked in the city!"
Nice neighborhood pizza place. ��Friendly service and good pizza. ��The two slices and a drink special (for under $6) is a really good deal. ��I tried a Margherita and a kielbasa/cucumber slice. ��The kielbasa (a daily special) was really good. ��They also have a huge variety of pizzas to order which I am sure to do in the near future. ��This is a great place to get lunch if you're in the area (or a quick bite after getting off of the train).
"I went there for the first time last week. I really thought it would be 'too much' but I can't wait to go back. Personally, I think the salad bar is a complete waste of time...but I realize its important to have. We even had dessert--the chocolate lava cake. Delicious!"
"tu pac, dmx, lady gaga and viet music all within one sitting....i would definitely consider this place a ""viet fast food"" jointnot the cleanest, not the best service.dj needs help, whoever dj is seems quite a bit confused...."
Great Burgers! ��Just don't go there on game days because it's packed!
"Was somewhat disappointed. I always enjoyed Le Colonial in San Francisco but, Le Colonial Chicago was a little to rush street for my taste. There was apparently two couples on either side of us that lived in the neighborhood and all they could talk about was how much money they made, the condo the just bought etc., etc. Not to mention the arrogance upstairs. The food was not up to par for the prices they charge."
"My wife and I went to The Gage during a business trip last October on the recommendation of the concierge at The Renaissance and we loved everything, repeat everything about this eatery. ��The service was attentive and very personable, the menu was both diverse and eclectic, the wine list was excellent, and the atmosphere was what I hoped for and expected at a downtown Chicago gastropub on a Friday night. ��My wife had a seasonal risotto and I had a regional sausage & peppers dish which were both fabulous. ��If you are visiting Chicago and want a true 'taste' of current Chicago restaurant fare, treat yourself to The Gage."
"Service was extraordinary. ��Waiter was very friendly and efficient. ��The cheese fondue is my fave. ��Lots of spices and cheese, They give you a flame for the hot meals with which you may roast marshmallows, and then dip them in the chocolate. ��Make sure to cover it in chocolate for the best effect! The fruit part was my fav and not the veggiesTry it out when you can. It's well."
"This is the place to get a sausage baby! Don't get a hot dog because its just a standard hot dog. But, get the duck sausage with foie gras and..........enjoy! Go on a rainy day after the lunch rush and you may only wait for 15 minutes. If you've never gone......GO!"
"Hands down the best thin crust in Wicker Park. ��I love coming here, and love the environment. ��Great place to watch a game, or invite friends from out of town. ��In general, their pizza never ever ever leaves me hungry.It gets packed pretty quickly, so keep that in mind, but I love coming in here on lazy sundays.My one gripe with this place is the service. ��Everyone is super friendly and nice, but I've been here about 20 times, and it always seems like it takes them forever to refill water or sodas. ��That, and it takes a long as time to get the bill. ��It's not like the servers are lazy or anything, it's just something that I always notice every time I bring friends in (they notice it too). ��Other than that... it's a fantastic place to eat."
We started with a terrific antipasto plate. ��I had a pasta special with clams. ��We selected a terrific Pinot Bianco from Alto Adige for under $40. ��Everything was excellent.
"I love this place. All of the food is delicious, moderately priced, and not too bad for you. Great atmosphere, byob, fast service, and cool people usually there. Priced decently, always filling. I often crave their food, not something i can say about most dining facilities. Great location too, in walking distance from my house, as im sure is the case for thousands of devoted customers! A+"
"While visiting Chicago recently, a friend and I decided to meet some people at the Violet Hour. I noticed a set of rules posted at the entry, and thought that the place was a little.. pretentious. ��Still, we decided to give the Violet Hour a chance. I see that some reviewers have complained about a lengthy wait, but we were seated with our friends after just a few minutes in line.We were seated in the back near a fireplace, and I did like the decor. ��But everything was too dark and too quiet. ��It definitely didn't seem like the place to go for fun on my last night in Chicago. ��After waiting around 20 minutes for a waiter, I chose a cocktail called Goya's Cous de Gras. ��It was definitely worth the $12, BUT not worth the $12 and the 30 minute wait to actually get my drink. ��By the time my fr"
Went here last Tuesday evening. They have a tapas menu on Tuesdays.incredible food. ��Top shelf service. ��Best simple Martini I've had in a long time. ��Dinner for three and we ordered a total of 7 dishes plus dessert. ��Everything was perfect. ��I will be back often. ��Love it here! ��Reasonably priced.
"Menu is impeccable. ��The wait is long, but for the best Italian I've had in Chicago, it's worth it.Atmosphere is really cool, looks like a wine cellar/wine bar. ��It's based on the enoteca concept, which is basically a wine bar where you can come check out local/regional wines. ��In keeping with this tradition, Davanti sells their bottles at retail prices, with a corkage fee if you open it at the table. ��Decent music selection as well.Anyone who discredits the menu may not have an appreciation for the Northern Italian flavor palette. ��I lived in Florence Italy for 3 years and know what I'm talking about and this place gets the classic flavor combinations right, while adding some delicious and innovative variations (which are always focused on tasting awesome)."
"This place has the best pizza in Chicago, well thats just my opinion. ��I love the deep dish pizza's and how the burnt cheese crust tastes. ��For two people ��you need nothing bigger than the 10 in.. deep dish which always fills me and a friend up. ��The place has a nice atomspher and is always clean. ��This is where i go before heading to the movies right across the street. ��The pricesd are resonable good, eats , good times... check it out.."
"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants. ��The ONLY thing I hate are the prices....ouch! ��The decor is creative & fun, the food is breath-taking & the service is so so. ��My absolutely favorite menu item is the ropa vieja. I dream about this at night! ��It is so fabulous & delicious & just thinking about it makes me want to go there now. ��I also recommend the arracheras, rice & beans....very very good. ��My friend (who is a very picky eater) ordered the pollo estilo billy which comes with papas fritas otherwise known as french fries & I was curious how they would taste so I tried one and even those were delicious! ��Everyone in our group of 10 was impressed & we will definitely be going back again soon!(The only reason I am rating it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the prices)"
"My new favorite quban spot I love it. The food and service was beyong great. Not to mention sat with the owner for about 5 hours having mojitos gracias amigo. Its a great spot not just because of the food but BYOB and eat good,cant beat that. The music is good too, makes you feel like your on vacation except when you leave your still in logan square he he"
"Solid food, cool vibe, byob + fun to watch the chefs.Gomae = nice with nice presentation, 3 tempura options all good (but the shrimp are coated in breadcrumbs, not tempura) and nice maki rolls (Sushi O Sushi on Armitage is better for the price)Steer clear of the specials, they can sometimes be suspect."
"This place was a total let down from what I heard and was totally different than I thought it was going to be. ��Outside of being over the pork trend-factor, the food just wasn't that good. ��The staff was moderately friendly and the place is impossible to get to.I won't be back."
Great food! ��I've been there twice in the past two months and will be going back next week. ��Love the salad bar and the Lobster Bisque is just unbeatable. ��The beef ribs are my favorite. ��The only things that are missing are shrimps and oysters. ��If they have these two more food I'll be going there at least every couple weeks.
"One of my favorite simple breakfast restaurants. The owner remembers your face when he isn't busy. I love to work here and I love that they didn't feel the need to overcharge just because of where they are located. The portions have decreased in size since their opening, but this is the only place that understands what I mean by scrambled eggs runny!!!! I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Very crowded on the weekends. Sometimes the wait can be over an hour:("
"I've lived in Chicago all my life and this is definitely a very important part of my childhood. The BBQ is always fresh + great though a bit high priced but worth it over the long trip to Chinatown, the atmosphere can be a bit lacking on slow days due to the huge new dining room. Very casual atmosphere with an open kitchen. Definitely not vegetarian-friendly with all of the meat hanging on display, but it's what you'll find in Chinese BBQ places world-wide. We were die-hard loyal Sun Wah fans until a few years back when we discovered other places in Chinatown that are almost just as good for a cheaper price. However, since it's the only decent BBQ place on the northside, I will always be a huge fan of them."
love their pho...tried phos all over the country and this is one of the better one...fun serving staff.
"Brought out of town guests here to have a sit down meal the other weekend (usually, Simply It is my go to lunch restaurant, so I know it's a great choice). Everyone had a wonderful time. I'm not sure whether it's the superb food or the wonderful service (probably both) but the dining room was packed and everyone seemed to be having a great time.Everyone who I brought had a great meal, and my out of town guests insisted that they want to come back here next time they visit Chicago.A+!"
Great place and great food. ��Really enjoyed it.
"This restaurant is atrocious and ridiculous. The service is horrid. We ordered wine and it never came. Never. Not even after our entrees came, not even after our meal was over. The waiter never even apologized. That is INSANE. On top of that the wine was all over 70 bucks. Way too high for a place like this. The food itself was unique but uninspired. Very below expectations. Obama ate here, really? The portions were so petite it was like a Saturday Night Live skit.AVOID THE HYPE and do not go here unless you like pretentious bland food."
Over prices and over rated .. I spent more at Tru and it was worth it ...but not at Elliot's not worth the money.
"Delicious pad thai. ��I forgot what else we had, but the pad thai was AWESOME. ��I can still taste it!"
If you LOVE meat this is the place for you. Great salad bar and ambience.
"I was stuck between a 3 and 4 star review. If you come here, do not get the meatball sandwich. With that being said, the reason for the 4 star review if the beer selection, and the service. I made the mistake of going in the middle of the afternoon, drinking 8-10 beers and walking out into the bright bright daylight. WOWOverall a good place, next I will get something else to eat"
"Hooray to 24/7 Korean BBQ!! Anytime I'm up in the Lakeview/bordering Evanston area, I have to hit up this restaurant. Just thinking about their sushi makes my mouth water. Because I'm a frequent customer, the sushi chef knows me quite well. They make awesome sushi here on top of their wonderful Korean BBQ. Their rolls are unique, off the charts, and not at all Americanized (watered down Cali rolls or diced up spicy tuna rolls). They combine your entire order on one or two platters and depending on the chef that's there at night, there are certain variations in the same sushi roll, which I like.Their Korean bbq is awesome!! Def try their kalbi or their bulgogi. Their bibimbop (sp??) is to die for as well. They have this spicy seafood noodle dish that's awesome, although my stomach can't han"
"Fox & Obel Food Market is a great gourmet grocery store featuring a cafe that serves amazing food that is often hard to find at some restaurants. You can ��purchase that certain cut of steak from their butcher, or the catch of the day from the seafood counter. In addition to the great selection of steaks and seafood, Fox & Obel Market offers the finest aged cheeses and wines. If you are in the process of planning your next get together you are sure to find prepared appetizers or main courses that will not only peak your taste buds, but also empty your wallet."
I'm sorry to say this but this place has the worst customer service!! The bartender who served me lunch this week was a really cute girl and well taken care off but her customer service skills are beyond imagination!! My advice is that if u like good italian food and u want to go to Calo don't sit at the bar!! That's all!
"Our family has been to Big Jones twice. Our first visit was an unqualified success: our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable, and interested in making sure we had a great experience. The food was scrumptious. So, naturally, we expected roughly the same on our second visit. Both times we arrived right around 6 pm (mid-week), and were one of only two-three occupied tables, but this time we were greeted by an obviously ""new"" waitress (possibly new to waiting tables ANYWHERE?) that was so soft-spoken we struggled to hear her. Okay, that's cool... everyone has to start somewhere, right? The wait between courses was excessive for the number of tables occupied. Because the waitress from our first visit had given us a heads-up that the Red Velvet Cake takes quite a while to make, we ordered it bef"
"Great food with the best service. I just came here for my birthday party last Saturday. As usual, they really really busy on Saturday but ?they still keep the best thing of their restaurant a quaint - sized restaurant with a heart of gold and love. There were nine of us and we had to wait for about 20 minutes. But you know what ?! The little lovely owner gave us many any COMPLIMENTARY appetizers and hot ginger teas for all of us. When we were waiting for tables. We were really surprised and kind of full before we got tables - not kidding what a sweet little owner !!! :-) Did you see any restaurant owner run around the restaurant even though he has more than 8 waiters and waitresses ? That's so funny. He breathed like he got heart attack but he still tried to make anybody happy and always h"
"Fat Juicy burgers.That's what you'll find at Lockdown, and lotsss of them! ��They have SO many options and they are all special in their own way. ��Choose your favorite and you will not be dissapointed.So far my favorite is the Jail House Rock- a burger with peanutbutter, bananas, and bacon.. sounds strange but the mix of tastes in your mouth is amazing (yes, that is was she said). Music can be a little disturbing at times, but if you can handle a little heavy metal for an hour or two the burger will be well worth it."
"This was my second visit to this restaurant. We came in for a late dinner after a show and the staff was very patient with us. ��I had a cheese flight and the polenta cakes. ��The cheese was fantastic but the polenta cake was a bit salty. ��We also enjoyed the cheese fondue and several people raved about their burgers and the ""surf & turf"" tartar. ��Always something interesting. Always something delicious. ��I just wish I hadn't missed the grilled cheese sandwich from the last menu change."
"Went here on the Saturday over Memorial Day weekend and I was very, very impressed. ?I have been to a few of the tapas places in the city, including Cafe Iberico, Cafe Ba-ba-reeba, and Emilio's. ?This place beats them all, hands down. ?First of all, I thought the decor and atmosphere were a cut above. ?Mercat is a more high-end, scene kind of place than the others. ?I mean that as a compliment, too. ?The beautiful people were milling around at the tables and the restaurant bar, where I had a chance to sample a couple of drinks - Spanish Fly and the pineapple mojitos. ?Not a mixed drink kind of guy by any means, but these were outstanding. ?Once we sat down, things got even better. ?We had the serrano ham and fig salad, which was basically a spinach salad with the ham wrapped around the out"
"The best Sichuan style food in Chicago. The food here is flavorful and ridiculously spicy, but those are the characteristics of Sichuan style food. Their fried chicken is the best but make sure to ask for a less spicy portion."
"Seriously guys. ?Your website says you are open from 10am till 2am. ?I come in at 4 pm for a late lunch / early dinner whatever you want to call it. ?I walk up to the empty bar (it's 4 in the afternoon, not busy yet). ?Bartender walks up and asks if I want a drink menu. ?I say, No, I'll take a food menu and a draft. ?He proceeds to ask which beer I'd like; he gets me the beer. ?I ask again for a menu at which time he now decides to say, oh, the kitchen is closed till 5, we only have olives or cheese till then. ?Really.... olives and cheese. ?I came for food. ?If you are not going to serve food, say so immediately when I ask for a menu, not after you ignore my request for a menu and get me a drink. ?Meanwhile, I'm starving and now chugging a beer on an empty stomach so that I can leave and "
Good food and even better service. ��Server was very helpful in picking out wines and meals... especially since they were out of my first two choices! ��That was the only downfall is that the specials sell out FAST on a Saturday night. ��Apparently you need to get here early for those... which means they must be excellent!
i wanted to like the place better....really not a whole lot to say...it was fine
"Great neighborhood pub, love the new look! This street really needed this place. Warm atmosphere, cozy, relaxing! Highly recommend. Food is also great."
I had my birthday dinner here a few weeks ago with 9 friends and it was perfect. ��BYOB with no corkage fee. ��The food was delicious and reasonably priced. ��They even provided fried banana dessert with a candle! The owner is very nice and accomodating. ��Great experience.
"Old school Italian joint, best Italian in Chicago. Service is unreal. I have tried almost everything and I haven't been disappointed yet. One tip: don't fill up on the bread."
"Before a recent trip to Chicago, a friend sent me a link to the L&E website. It turned out to be one of the most prized recommendations I've ever received. Not only was the dining an unparalleled experience, but what I realized even many locals don't know, is that they offer slick, stylish accommodations upstairs.There are only about 6 rooms, ranging in size and price (from affordable to really affordable!!). And one of the best perks of being a guest - you can make a reservation at the restaurant, something they otherwise don't allow. The rooms are above the busy bar, but my friend and I weren't bothered by the noise. It only seemed to add to the flavor of the experience.As far as the restaurant, the accolades L&E has received speak for themselves. I had the crispy pork belly and they coa"
"I have only eaten in the restaurant once and remember it being really good. �� I ordered delivery tonight and was really, really impressed. ��I got one maki roll and it was huge! ��Usually, maki rolls are thin with barely any sushi, but Indie's maki rolls are huge with lots of sushi in them. ��The nigiri pieces were also really large and very fresh. ��The suzuki (sea bass) was delicious. �� I would definitely recommend delivery for sushi from Indie. ��Everything came quick and was very nicely presented for delivery."
"The food is pretty all right, but the prices are out totally out of line with the rest of the neighborhood. ��For the baked chilaquiles, sure I'll pay. ��But any regular ol' breakfast stuff, you may as well head down the street to the Bridgeport at 35th or Ramova just south of that."
"I love the Chicago Diner! ��The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that there is always a lengthy wait for a table.If you want healthy, comfort food, this is the place and if you want some amazing desserts, look no further. ��There food is a party in my tummy no matter what i choose."
"Has one of the best burgers I have ever tasted. Any time you can reheat a burger and it taste as good as it did when you first ordered it , thats a goooood burger!"
"went here last weekend with the girls.. amazing drinks and great food. Service was OK..but the atmosphere, food, and drinks made up for it!"
90 miles' lechon sandwich and goat cheese empanada are two of the best things to happen to me since moving to Chicago.
"My friend's dish was OK. My dish (duck tigh) was terribly dry. Every dish is overpriced, including drinks."
"We were staying in the hotel and made reservations at Mercat on a Sunday night. All in all, it was a decent experience. The room had a bit of a clubby feel to it with the music, which isn't our scene...but surely appeals to some.The food is good. There are many different menu options ranging from lobster to more traditional tapas. My only complaints are that our service was a bit slow when the restaurant was definitely nowhere near capacity, and also the cost.Due to the small plate nature of the restaurant, you have to order a fair amount to fill up. We overdid to be safe and ordered 7 items and had a couple carafes of wine. We were full, but wound up dropping over $200 for two people. I have no problem spending $200 for a meal, but I would like for it to memorable. I would not put Mercat "
"My friend and I came here after a nice dinner for coffee and dessert. I was so excited to find a place like this in my neighborhood, but I was shocked at how rude our waiter was. I think he was the bartender (tall with black hair - looked like he worked out). It made you wonder what was going on. He was nasty, condescending and confrontational, and we were friendly! If I were a guy, I totally would have punched him out. I felt like I was on that MTV show, Boiling Point. The place seemed okay otherwise, but it was hard to tell, because the guy was such a jerk."
"The food was lovely, but the Saturday night underground tasting at $85 really wasn't worth the price. The dessert was spectacular, as was the fois gras, but the portions were so microscopic that we all ended up at the tasy freeze for fries after dinner! There are better restaurants of better value in Chicago"
"My buddy has been going here almost everyday for his lunch break and I have been making fun of him. ��I kid you not, he seriously has put on about ten lbs since July and I keep telling him it's because that is when he started going to Hot Doug's. ��Finally I decided to I needed to put on some weight and instead of my usual lunch joints I joined him. ��I think I am going to be 20lbs more by summer, this place is amazing but I don't have to tell you that because they have a crazy number of reviews. Plus they finally motivated me to yelp!"
"Happened upon this place randomly, and it was good. Nice place, ambiance is clean and Southern without being overbearing. As that, the chairs are kind of uncomfortable, being faux wrought iron. Besides that, the food was very good. The corn muffins with honey butter were brought out hot and were delicious! I might go back just to have some of those and soup. Appetizers of crab cake and celery root soup were very tasty, though the celery soup was one-dimensional. Entrees of catfish and pork chop were good was well, catfish was more tasty and tender, but baked pean puree on the chop plate was interesting. For drinks they had a nice tea selection and nicely presented, while I had the 'homemade' ginger beer, which was very tasty and refreshing. Service was very nice and friendly from the lady "
"Hands down, this is one of my favorie restaurants in the city. ��The service is phenomenal, food is beyond amazing, and you cannot taste anything better in the city than the duck, duck goose!!!!!"
"This isn't everybody's thing. A lot of people who have never had stuffed pizza before and try it for the first time are disappointed. I think that people need to stop thinking of this as pizza -- it's something entirely different, but soooo good. I've been eating Giordano's since I moved to Chicago as a kid. Now I'm away at college and can't find good stuffed pizza anywhere, let alone people who actually know what stuffed pizza is :(In any case, Giordano's is the best stuffed pizza in the city. Hands down."
"I was pleasantly awed! ��Calo Ristorante exceeded my expectations. I chose to celebrate my birthday here with an intimate group of friends and definitely recommend others to do the same. ��The service, food, and drinks, as well as the warm environment of the restaurant was so refreshing! Our waiter, Juan, handled a table of 30 and our table of 12 and was still so prompt with every thing. My pork chops were overcooked, it was bearable I just thought I'd let Juan know that it was a little dry. He brought the owner over to the table and he had the chef cook me knew ones to take home with me. A large piece of tirimisu, which, might i add was to die for, was brought to the table along with singing. The owner handed me a $25giftcard and apologized for the chops. One of the best dining experiences "
"Honestly, honestly, I've never seen such a scam! ��I feel sorry for the people who don't see it?!?! ��I've never written a review on here but just can't get over this one!! ��I'm not even upset about the $ it was EVERYTHING!! ��I would NEVER return..."
"I came here a couple weeks ago with a some friends and I was immediately surprised at the line given it was early on in the day. My friend said we were going for hot dogs so I assumed I'd get a chicago style hot dog..not here. As I waited in line some guy said something like I just don't know how people can come here and get a regular dog. ?I was surprised because that's what I was planning on doing, until I looked at the menu and realized what he meant. I've never seen anything like the options Hot Dougs has. HD has the most outlandish ingredients one could possibly fathom, but it works. I didn't go too crazy and got a spinach and mozzarella chicken sausage with sun dried tomatoes and smoked provolone cheese. Hot Dougs has a specialty all their own and I'm glad I tried it. Note: if you wa"
"I went here with high expectations based on several friends' reviews, and left not merely disappointed, but disgusted. ��The location was dirty and the service poor. ��I can overlook those problems if the food was good enough, but this was the worst tacos I've had in Chicago. ��Cheap, fatty meat with little flavor, bland tortillas, and lousy salsa all make this place somewhere to avoid. ��Eat at Lizard Tacos futher down on Ashland, or at some place in Pilsen like Nuevo Leon instead."
"This is the best sushi I've had since i was in Los Angeles.The waitstaff is extremely helpful and made excellent recommendations. The sushi is impeccable and beautifully presented. Even the atmosphere is fun, with a diverse crowd of people ranging from business executives, to hipsters, to family parties.I highly recommend Coast. It is easily my favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago."
"San Soo Gab San has come a long way in the years it's been around. I live down the street, and as a result cannot award this place more than 3 stars simply for the parking headache all you raving yelpers have caused me... However, the food is pretty spectacular, and unlike when they first opened, the service is not too bad. I used to be afraid to come in here unless one of my Korean friends was in tow. I know that sounds bad, but back in the day, we used to honestly make a game out of rating the service in here with versus without a korean in the dinner party. The results were needless to say, a little lopsided. I guess they eventually realized what business the yuppie invasion could bring them and started being nice to everyone.I would certainly recommend them for Korean BBQ, and chances "
"I stumbled upon this place one night when I had friends in town and we could not get into Cafe Ba Ba Reeba without waiting 1.5 hours. ��We were reluctant at first (Vietnamese in Lincoln Park...?!) but I am so glad we gave it a try! The atmosphere is a lot better than what you would get in a typical Vietnamese Restaurant and we loved the apps (Calamari Salad is to die for), bubble tea smoothies, and the entrees - we got Beef and Mushroom, Chicken Fried Rice, and the Roasted Duck. ��We were stuffed and still had leftovers. ��If you want a good meal for not a lot of money in Lincoln Park, I would strongly recommend trying Simply It!"
"As the other review said, one word sums up the marvelousness of this place: macaronsIt is very rare to find macarons in the US, let alone ones THIS good. Plus the flavors are creative, overall true decadence!!"
"You have to try the hand dryer in the bathroom! OMG, you will love it. It's like jumping out of an airplane. Super powerful air turbo style. Besides that, the food is spectacular, the service is great. This location is better than the one in schaumburg, il."
Fantastic crepes!
I know this place doesn't need any more positive comments because if you go there just once the wonderful food speaks for it's self. ��I am a vegetarian and when I saw the salad bar I was in heaven. ��It is a little bit pricey but very well worth it.
"Never thought I would do this, but my experience this past Saturday night at 50/50 warranted me to sign up and write about our experience at this bar. We arrived later in the evening and had a horrible experience. This bar, and many bars like it, are seeing an increase in douchebags! ��I will never go back!"
"The pizza is good. ��I will concede that. ��My issue is with the delivery ��- we have waited an exceedingly long time for delivery on more than one occasion. ��The first instance, we were quoted a hour - it took 3 hours to get our pizza. Three hours. Several months later, we tried again. ��Again, a quote of one hour. ��The delivery took 2 hours. After calling several times and getting the run around, our pizza did arrive, cold. ��Not a fan."
"Value Value Value. I cannot find another place that will match the cost and quality of the food. I've had every steak and veal dish and loved them all. The chicken Vesuvio is famous, all the pizzas are great. We had a 100 guest baby shower there, served family style, and had guests call us to meet for for dinner. Usually family style is so/so at a banquet but not here, the cost per person and the happy (and full!!!) guests makes La Villa the best family Italian restaurant . P.s. I have over 300 call in/catered orders over the last 6 years."
It's great!
"Excellent, unusual Mexican food with fresh, fresh ingredients and flavors. ��Only minus is getting a seat."
it's a transplant factory. I wish some yuppies kid would vomit on the floor.
"I don't know what's going on, but I've been here 3 times and every time the food was awful. ��I left a review before and now its the last straw. ��I like Vietnamese food, but not this place. ��Flavors are bland, the snapper was transformed to dry jerky, the pho was a tasteless broth with gristle in it but no meat or anything palatable, the place wasn't the cleanest, and the service was mediocre to bad. ��I am really baffled by why this place gets such good reviews. ��I gave it 3 chances, and it failed, failed and failed. ��I can only assume that everyone who likes it is just a bunch of bandwagoners, like so many Chicagoans and Midwesterners (yes, my people. my own people!) are. ��Alas."
"Went here for dinner a few weeks ago with a party of six. ��Make sure you are hungry when you get here because the food is literally never ending. ��The formal buffet style of this restaurant allows you to try a little bit of everything, while still allowing you to choose the pace of the meal. ��The food was very good, although the wait staff was a little too attentive, often interrupting conversations to ask questions and offer more. ��The drinks were good as well. ��The biggest hiccup came at the end of the night when the bill came, and the waitstaff found it very difficult to split the bill up among the multiple couples. ��Overall a good place that I would go again."
"There's a lot of hype around this place. �� It is a good hot dog place and the variety is excellent. ��However, I will be a bit nit-picky. ��Why would anyone stand in line for 30 minutes for a hot dog? ��They are not THAT good.I think that the dogs are supposed to be good because of all the hype so everyone's brain is getting tricked.Service is fair - in and out and then get out we have more customers type of mentality. ��Yes they smile.Their hours of operation are not that good. ��Always closed. ��They make so much money, they close their doors whenever they want.I don't get the hype. ��I'll give them 4 stars cause the dogs were good, not great. ��People get over it, they are just hot dogs, man."
oh my damn!!! must do before you die
"Not sure if the obnoxiously loud, large group at one table impacted our brunch, but it's reprehensible to have to wait over an hour to get your food. ��People next to us ordered just prior to us and they were fed,done and chatting while we still hadn't received our food. ��After waiting for 45 minutes, the waitress finally came over to say our food was on its way. NOT!!!!My daughter watched a table that came in at this point, seated, ordered their food and got it within 15 minutes of ordering and we still hadn't been served our food. ��At the one hour mark, I was ready to leave without getting our food, we were all getting cranky, except for the baby, she got fed and was ready to take a nap, but the rest of us were still waiting. ��When we finally got our food, the manager came over as a court"
Prompt delivery. Decent food except for the baked clams that were disgusting. How can one put salt on clams. ICK I don't understand why they get such good reviews. Someone must be paying them. Never again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gross.
"Both from experience (simply wonderful food) and reputation, hosted a small birthday party there. ��Food was uniformly excellent - guests ordered from the menu, and every item was a delight. ��Not so delightful - being crammed into a corner in a room complete with low ceiling, a ��large, noisy group, and an inept waiter with attitude. ��Could not converse with our guests, ears still ringing form the noise two hours later, etc. ��Although reservation noted that event was a significant birthday, no notice taken by restaurant - not even a candle in dessert. ��Wine list is excellent. ��Waiter was useless - no help with ordering and inattentive in serving it. �� The review is a mix of five for the food and a one for this experience."
"Been coming here just about once a year, and will likely keep the trend going! I like to keep it simple with just a plain deep dish, but it's amazing every time! A little busy for my liking sometimes, but always worth the wait!"
Made a reservation for my birthday and gave them a credit card to confirm. Showed up only to see a sign that said Closed due to broken air conditioning. Seriously?! Didn't even have the decency to call me to tell me that they were closed.
"Just left the Grand lux.It was arguably the best restaurant we've ever eaten in. You DO need to pace yourself though. I had the potato wraps, my wife the appetizer blue cheese salad. The presentation was awesome, and the love put into this food shows. I followed with the chicken piccata. Best ever! My wife had the grilled Mahi. They were both awesome. You should know that I've caught and cooked fresh Mahi for her, so when she says awesome, you should run down there. Can't say enough... Great experience.."
One of the best place to get thai food in chicago in my opinion. Been going here since i was in highschool and i always bring my girlfriends here and all of them loved it. And it pretty nice in there too with wooden frames of thai land sceneries.
"The food was great as always, but the wait was absolutely ridiulous! My recommendation is to go during the off time. We had to wait over 1 hour and 40 minutes! Still the food was fantastic and didn't disappoint!"
"Good place not great. I would almost give it 4 stars for the service, our waiter was very good. I did not know its a tasting menu which may be part of my disappointment, my fault I guess I should have known that before booking."
"Well my first Yelp review and I'm sorry to say it's not going to be pretty....I've long used Yelp to guide me in my dining choices and it's usually spot on, as it was here with Sunda, but unfortunately only with the bad reviews.As others have complained, my reservation was not honored, and by a good long time. ��Surely they must be aware of this problem by now but you'd never know it by the way they handled it, no finesse, no apologies, no nothing. ��I'm trying to think of words to sum up this experience, but I just can't. ��Maybe this will do...when my friends & I walked outside after we were done, we just looked at each other and someone said, ""What the f was that?"" and we all just shrugged our shoulders.

I love this place. ��It is fun to go here with a group of girlfriends and have a few drinks and great food. ��Even though the wait is long it is worth it!
"Now, going to Mexican restaurants with my Mexican mom is a true ordeal as everything, according to her, is not up to par with her traditional cooking. ?I must say, however, we were both excited to eat at this restaurant because we have witnessed how Rick Bayless submerged himself into Mexican cuisine with truly admirable dedication. To start off, we had our Jamaica drinks, and the hint of lemon in it (I believe) immediately hit me, it was a nice twist to the traditional drink and was equally as refreshing after a full day of sightseeing. Moving on to the tortas, I was bummed to learn that the person who took my order had messed it up and ordered a Milanesa instead of the Tinga Torta. But I was hungry and could not wait to eat. Boy was I glad to have settled with my order, as I was blown aw"
"Simply put, THERE IS NO OTHER PLACE LIKE IT. ��Truly one of a kind.If you are visiting the Windy City and willing to pay for the best steak and seafood place in town or any other town for that matter, then you must go there.If you're from Chitown, well chances are you already know what I am talking about.To get the full experience, take the time to have a drink or two (not to mention their oysters) at the bar before getting seated at your table."
"I can't believe people actually think this place is good. I've tried it twice as to give it the benefit of the doubt, but both times it has failed. The most recent time I ordred a veggie burrito & was served a steak burrito...no big deal - send it back for veggie, but was then eating it only to find meat in it still. When I asked to have the burrito removed from my bill I had 3 waitstaff at my table including the manager accusing me of changing my order & possibly putting meat in from my husband's burrito! They even asked me how allergic to meat I was & said it should be OK since I didn't actually eat any of the meat...hardly the point! ��I'm sure many of you have had great experiences, but I have not at all & wanted to pass it on."
Great sushi - and my vegetarian friends loved it too. ��The best part was the dessert - little ice cream balls in all kinds of delicious flavors. ��Whoever invented these was a genius. ��If I had any complaints it would be that the music was a little too loud for comfortable conversation with anyone not sitting right next to me. ��But a small price to pay for this great food - I dream of my next visit.
"Now if you are looking for a great restaurant go to Sabatinos, I've being going there forever & I will continue going for the best Italian food ever"
I loved Demera. ��I went there the other night with my girlfriend and the food was wonderful. ��The server went through the entire menu with us and practically ordered our dinner for us. ��She was a great help. ��The manager came to the table several times and brought us drinks and offered honey wine for us to try. ��The entire experience was wonderful.
"DO NOT EAT BREAKFAST OR LUNCH AT YOLK. ��I live in the bldg. next to this place, and I have tried it on a few occasions for brunch and very disappointed and 1 time before today for lunch. This place is very consistent.....at being terrible. I consider my taste buds very in tune w/ good food and good value. I order the buffalo chicken wrap w/ blue cheese, fries and a Pepsi. The wrap seemed old and stale, they use soggy iceberg lettuce, the chicken did not taste very fresh and hot, the diced tomatoes were like the ones you'd get at Taco Bell, the blue cheese tasted old and didn't even really taste like blue cheese, and the fries were not hot and a bit stale. The wrap pretty much fell apart when I picked it up. Terrible presentation. Yolk should be paying me $13.04 to eat this crap. Yolk is to"
"This place is amazing! ��These are the best tacos de asada that you I've had anywhere in the country! ��Wow... even when I used to live in Milwaukee and I came to Chicago on the weekends, I would bring some of their tacos to my friends because they loved them so much!"
"I'm going to follow up to my partner James G.So we had the Quiche (aka Egg Jello) and Egg-Layonaise (aka Steak n' Shake French Fry Salad) and amazingly, following our review, we received an email from Sarah the general manager. I am sure that you are (like we did) expected an explanation of the dishes maybe, a little bit of info, maybe we can even stretch as far to say a condolences let alone an apology, but no. No such luck.Instead she told us that we clearly didn't get her joke about there being tables inside the dining area we could be sat at, suggesting a) that she knew it was a stupid place for a table and b) that it is our responsibility to make sure we are properly taken care of at her restaurant (actually, that doesn't sound half bad, looking back at it, I would have gladly gone to"
"Great Chicago 'Za. ?The key here is to ask for the pizza well done meaning the cheese is baked until carmelized around the edges. ?This is deep dish, but not stuffed pizza. ?Pep/Mushroom combo is solid. ?Currently the location in the city is under reconstruction, but they will deliver from the burbs if you call the regular number. ?Worth the wait on delivery and a must visit once they re-open at the intersection of clyb/webster."
"I really liked it. ��I think it was a bit overhyped based on everyone commenting that it was the best ever, but it was quite good. ��Probably one of the top 20 restaurants in Chicago."
"Las Tablas has some of the best food and greatest restaurants I have been to in my life, which is saying a lot. ��I went on a Monday night so obtaining reservations for a party of 11 on the day before the reservation was certainly not difficult. I held a surprise dinner for my boyfriend's birthday, which I provided explicit in instructions to the host. ��These were, ""you must say party for 2 NOT 11, otherwise it wouldn't be a surprise!"" These were not ignored and acquiescently followed, which I greatly appreciated. ��Now let me tell you about the food and service. ��The food was the best Colombian food I have had in my life. ��For the appetizer I ordered the Empanadas Combinaciones to split, which comes with cheese, beef, and chicken Empanadas. ��These were really amazing. ��What puts them apart "
"must say, i have heard so much about this restaurant in the past years, that we finally got there last Saturday. ��we had to wait at the bar for a table, but we did not mind because the drinks are so good. everything we ate was the freshest quality you could find. service was friendly. the place was packed but still had a good vibe to iti would be happy to go back"
"this could be the most disgusting place i've ever been to in my life. everything was greasy and awful, including the people that work there. i'll never be back. have a great day."
Wow they have so many reviews they just open about a year ago. The food is awesome though. I remember knocking on the window and asking them when were they gonna open. Operated by a beautiful husband and wife team (sometimes their at the register). I love their cuban sandwiches. I always get the bistec sandwich with the little fried chips on th side. They also do smoothies. Outdoor seating is available small inside; but the delicious food make up for it. Great hospitality. You guys are gonna need a bigger space.
Fantastic desserts and wide selection of main entrees! Price is reasonable for a River North restaurant.
"Garcia's Restaurant isn't bad, it's just...I can't put my finger on it. I heard from some people who've been there before the renovations that they were more customer-oriented than they are now. I think because they expanded the restaurant and they have more room now, they're more focused on higher turnovers than individual customer satisfaction, which is understandable, considering how big it is now compared to before and they need to fill more seats. I just don't want them to focus more on being a franchise restaurant like TGI Friday's or Olive Garden rather than an individual restaurant. I will say this. Every time I go there, I always get at least one horchata (rice water for those who don't know) for myself. Those things are delicious. Most of the time, I don't deviate from what I kno"
"very accommodating with a large group. the main courses were delicious, especially the lemongrass chicken and coconut mango beef dish. they set up our tables nicely for the reservation and brought out the courses in a timely manner. I had a great time."
"So I'm looking for a place in Chicago where I can get a SLICE of pizza, not a whole pizza, just a slice. In New York and Jersey there are places on every corner that specialize in slices of pizza. Not in Chicago. So I read the rave reviews about this place and they sell slices so I drive down to try it out. Can you say MEDIOCRE? BORING? NOTHING SPECIAL? I truly don't understand what all the fuss is about. It has the same old too-thick pastry-dough crust that all Chicago pizza has. Poor, silly midwesterners. You don't know what good pizza is. LOL."
"This place seems a little rotten. ��I was turned off as soon as I walked in. ��The decor is terrible and gloomy. ��Sushi joints are supposed to be a little flashy, no?Too expensive for the taste, when Butterfly down the street does everything better and less expensive.The staff was not the best by any means, after being asked a question our server responded with a short, snippy answer as she was WALKING AWAY!Not wasting my time/$$$ there again."
spring rolls andsquash soup andtaste of cubaoh my!!!
"I love the Diner!! It's my favorite! The soymilk shakes here alone are worth the trip. The ambiance is casual. The service is nothing to write home about. But hell, it's a diner! How often can you say that vegan food actually sticks to your ribs?? It really does here! The flavors are always just right and I actually crave the food between visits. Their raw nachos are to DIE for....which is probably why they're often sold out if you get there late. The food at the Diner pretty much ruins any chance other veggie places have to kick ass. I love the Chicago Diner."
"I went looking for a nice and small neighborhood restaurant in the Gold Coast neighborhood (near northside Chicago) where I could get a tasty bottle of wine and a 'bistro' meal. I found it with the 3rd Coast Cafe Wine Bar. I had a delightful CA cabernet (Priest Ranch 2008) and a wonderful Italian stir fry. The meal was light (sauge and vegetables) with a little bite. I started with a Caesar salad and finished with an espresso and in-house-made NY cheesecake. The meal was delightful and it finished with a visit from the proprietor, Janet, which always impresses me (an owner at work after 9 pm). I highly recommend when you are looking for something 'off-Rush Street.'"
"If you think Panda Express is good Chinese, you might think that India House is good Indian. The best food that they brought to the table was the naan and dipping sauce. (This is why I gave the second mercy star.) Try Clay Oven it is better and in the same vicinity."
"Quick service, really really good salad bar and decent prices on shisha according to my friend. ��So so so wish it was open late night."
"90 Miles Cafe is a small little joint that really gives you a feel for that Cuban Experience when you walk right in, Salsa Music is pounding and they have pictures of all these famous Cuban Americans. Staff is Great Service is Fast! Its about 7 dollars for the Cuban Sandwich which is so awesome. You can eat this sandwich at anytime during the it really really is good ! Def pick up the Cuban Sandwich This place gets two thumbs up from me!"
Very good. The atmosphere is very romantic and reasonable priced for a downtown restaurant.Wait time even with a reservation is long. Food was excellent service also very good. I would definitely go here again.
"It seems like everyone else really loves this place, but it was by far the worst dining experience I have ever had. I even signed up for a Yelp account just so I could negatively review them.I came on a weekday for dinner with three friends and ordered their signature crepe - I think it's called the Icosium something obvious like that - and the whole experience was just bad. It began with my lamb soup which had absolutely no lamb in it, just globs of lamb fat. Grossed out, I didn't eat it. Then I remember sitting for a long time with a mint leaf in an empty glass because, despite being overstaffed for the amount of people in there, it took forever for them to get around to filling water glasses. When they did fill them, the water was room temperature. Next, the crepe. Good God, the crepe. "
Pequods has the best regular/deep dish pizza in Chicago. ��The crust is amazing!
great sushi! not too expensive. ��nice atmosphere. �� The restaurant is small and always crowded on weekends. ��They have a nice outdoor patio that is a must during summer months.
"Coming here I had high hopes that this place was going to have amazing sushi after reading all the reviews. However, I was very disapointed. The rolls were tiny and the prices were too high for the quality of the fish. The rolls didn't taste special and our waiter was arrogant. I guess you have to try everything once and now I know that this place is just overhyped."
Love this place!! Gotta have the saganaki-who doesn't love flaming cheese? ��The veal paprikash was to die for. Great live music by Ana Munteneau(sp?) & Jarvis Raymond.
"Going to Zed451 is always a good time. If your looking for great food, beautiful people, and swanky decor this is your place. Most recently took some friends to dinner here and absolutely loved the experience. My server(LIZ) who I have every time I sit down for dinner was great as usual. There whole dinning experience is phenomenal, from the friendly service to the chiefs serving various choices of meats, poultry, and fish servings. Try the Braised pork belly. My Favorite. The cherry on top was the executive chef coming to our table and chatting about the foods and how lively our group was, oh and also meeting one of the owners in the john.Must go for those who like to indulge in fantastically prepared foods and decadent wines."
"I really enjoyed my Bi Bim Bop! I'll be back at Crisp, for sure!"
"Love this place. Finally a ��bar with great food, great craft beer list, and a great atmosphere. I went on a Saturday with a couple of friends around 8pm. The place was packed but it was easy to get a drink at the bar as the bartenders were on top of their game and alert. We were behind another group next to the bar and the bartender noticed that we needed drinks.If I can make one recommendation it is to get the mussels! So good! I also ended up getting french onion soup which was to die for and the tilapia sandwich, also good. ��Overall great time with my friends and the bill was reasonable as well. I will definitely be back."
"Stopped in here two nights ago for a quick bite with an out of town family member. I'd never been here before but she was staying at the Marriott and we wanted somewhere nearby. When we arrived the restaurant was packed, but we were actually able to get a table about 25 minutes later. There was outdoor terrace seating within an enclosed tent setup for winter. There were large space heaters so the area was actually quite warm, but with everyone walking in and out of the restaurant itself, we decided that sitting inside would be less hectic.Most of the plates are small and so you'd want to order about 2-3 plate a person. We went with the mixed green salad to start, it had an unusual but yummy mint red wine dressing. If was super fresh and we devoured it. We also ordered the cheese plate whic"
"In a nutshell, this restaurant has unique very flavorful food but has an overlycomplicated ordering/seating process and is overpriced. For the food, I ordered chips and salsa with guacamole, one of the caldos, churros and a beer. ��The chips and salsa are perfectly fine but come with an incredibly skimpy quantity of guacamole. ��I had no idea what a caldos was and was surprised when it was delivered but ate it with an open mind and enjoyed it immensely. ��Think of the caldos as mexican pho. The caldos are intensely flavored and have a perfect balance of flavors. �� The churros were good as well but perhaps too doughy.My main issue with this restaurant is the bizzare method of ordering food and being seated. ��You are assigned a table but order at a register. ��When I entered the restaurant I wal"
I love the mojitos and the atmosphere is very sophisticated yet laid back. ��Also try the tres leches for dessert... it is one of my favorites!
"Irazu is by far my favorite little place to eat. I love all the veggie options, and it is right across from the teacher store I frequent. The soy oatmeal shake, plantanos, veggie tacos, egg sandwich...all make my list of tops. ��It is great to eat in or carry out. They have a nice outdoor seating section that is a wonderful place to unwind after work or to grab a bite on a summer day.Service is a little slow, but always friendly. If you haven't experienced Irazu, get on it!"
"My wife loves this place! ��We were here once for dinner, and the food impressed us. We had a lot of high quality steak and salad. ��Before we closed our bill, we ordered some dessert. We were amazed by the flan. ��It was soft, sweet and smooth. ��As I write this review, I really want to order one from there for dessert tonight. ��Dinner costs about $60 per person just for dinner (dessert excluded), but I immediately found out during my first visit that their lunch only costs $20 per person. ��We tried with a few friends for lunch later on, and we continued to enjoy the service and food. ��Even though lunch had fewer varieties of meat and salad, but their flan cost much less (around $5 during lunch while $10+ during dinner). ��I will definitely come back again."
"Another hiden treasure! ��Fondue dining at its best. ��I Love this restuarant -- it's perfect for a romantic evening on a tight budget. This place reeks of romance complete with live classical guitar on weekends. ��The food is excellent with a great selection. ��The private booths are extremely romantic, but even if you can't arrange for a booth, the general ambiance is perfect for a romantic evening. Excellent wine list with some excellent inexpensive wines for those on a budget. Fondue is something you either like or don't -- but I defy you to not like the melted chocolate Fondue it is incredible."
"We found out about Gino's East on Superior Street from TV Show Man V Food, so while we were in Chicago traveling there for a few days with family, Hubby said that we just have to go there. There was 6 of us all together so we ordered mozzarella sticks, and chicken wings to start with and 2 deep dish pizza pies, one was a large meat feast and the other was a medium ham. The starters were yummy, i stuck with the mozzarella sticks as the wings were to spicy for me. I found that when the pizza's came out they were ok, but i stuck to the ham, I found that there was a lot of sauce and not much flavor to them and was not to keen on the crust as it was a bit dry for me. They make sure that your drinks are filled up. If there is any pizza left, then they put it in a box for you to take home, we onl"
"Irazu is THE BEST little restaurant you can only find in a big city 'hood. The steak w/ Costa Rican rice, cabbage salad and plantains is absolutely amazing and something I DREAM about. Order it spicy for a grilled jalapeno on the side. The service is lovely and the atmosphere is amazing - especially in the summer w/ the expansive porch open. It's BYOB so head to Red & White for a gorgeous bottle of wine or a couple of single beers."
"Went Saturday for ��lunch....busy but not too crowded and service didn't suffer at all. ��I had the vegan reuben sandwich that has gotten lots of press - it was great, and the fries that came with it were some of the best ever. ��We also has a variety of the bruschetta ��- they were all good but the ��cauliflower and white beans, etc. was fantastic. I would definitely get an entire order of that. ��My companion had the chicken sandwich with a nice looking side salad, which was delicious as well. ��Huge portions - we both took home half of our meal. ��Our server was friendly and prompt ��- all in all a great experience and we'll be back"
"The staff is friendly and knowledgeable - I'm just started to develop my sushi palate, so I'm pretty lost when reading sushi menus.The recommendations the waitress made were amazing. ��She also took the time to explain to me what certain types of ingredients are, and what generally goes well together.My husband doesn't like sushi, but there is plenty for him to enjoy here. ��He swears by the basil chicken, and we both love their crab rangoon!It's tricky to find parking around the Indie cafe, but it's worth it!"
"I LOVE this place. ��Great Beer, Great service, and Fantastic Pizza. ��No Matter what kind you get the pizza is always Delish!"
"I've been to Kuma's Corner at least 5 times before I heard of Lockdown, and I'm glad I finally got the chance to check this place out.First of all, half-priced burger Tuesdays? Fuck yeah. The burgers here are pricey but they are delicious and will definitely hit your spot. They don't have as many pre-made burger options as Kuma's but they do give you a list of all their toppings, plus they give you the option of adding them to your burger for just $1 per topping. At Kuma's that doesn't really fly, they even have a sign that asks customers to try and avoid changing the ingredients on their burgers. Also, the staff here is SUPER laxed and friendly. Not in that creepy in-your-face kind of way but they genuinely seemed happy enough to put some personality and fun into their work and customer s"
"I've read the other reviews (thanks Yelp) and just had to go and check it our for myself, so my wife and I went for Valentine's day and we both loved it!First of all I am glad I made reservations for 7p- it was packed at 7:30 and a line was out the door.If you do not mind eating with your hands, enjoy spicy (think Indian) food, and have an open mind when it comes to table settings, then I think you may enjoy Demera.First off there are two types of tables here: the normal table that you will find at any other restaurant ��as well as the traditional Ethiopian tables and chairs that look like something you would find in a hookah lounge. They are low to the ground, informal and dare I say it- fun.We were seated in the traditional setting with the low table for drinks etc, and the second hand wo"
"My favorite place for sushi. A little too expensive but worth it. The lighting is a little too dark too. Byob a plus, of course!"
"I went here for dinner last night with a group of friends - we were 7 total. ��After we sat down and caught up a bit, we started reviewing the menu and discussing what we might order as appetizers. ��We didn't order anything, but all of a sudden the waiter came out with the things we had discussed. ��It was kind of nice, kind of weird. ��What if we'd changed our minds? ��We weren't sure what to think, and everyone had this moment of doubt - had we ordered and forgotten? ��It was a ballsy, possibly invasive move by our waiter, but luckily everyone was content with what we received. ��As other reviewers have noted, the main entrees are all really large. ��My BF got the gnocchi in bolognese sauce, which he devoured with only a little help from me. ��I got the funghi pasta, which was pretty good though"
"im not sure if im being biased because im greek, but greeks know how to cook. ive been going to the greek islands since i was a kid and still i have never once a had bad experience, the staff is very attentive. anyone looking for some good greek food i am telling you...GO! you wont regret it!"
"It's okay, I mean it took an excessive amount of time to have one little sandwich and the service was not really there. It was okay for a little lunch before a long walk. Other than that nothing really exciting."
"This place is heaven for a born and raised Chicagoan! Doug, you are so nice and always give the best service available, thank you! Your staff is also very sweet! The dogs at Hot Dougs are absolutely amazing. What I love about this place is the variety of ways you can eat a dog. The different dressings and the way the dog can be cooked are great, options, options, options! The best is their Chicago style dog. Words cannot express! You must try this place."
"A-ok is how I feel about this place, but I am open to coming back and adding another star. I want to. I would actually like to give this place 3 1/2 stars. Nice atmosphere, really friendly staff, prompt service. Beer was really good, and the waitress let me sample one before ordering. BUT, I am so disappointed in the reuben. I was hoping for something as delicious or more delicious (is that possible) as the reuben at Chicago Diner, and this reuben is no where near that deliciousness. Marinate isn't that great, it doesn't even taste like a reuben, has way too much of a tempeh taste (maybe thiner strips would have been better?) and worse, it tastes like something I could make at home. I was looking forward to having 1/2 a reuben and bringing the rest for lunch tomororw. I will eat it, but I'"
The Violet Hour is unique. I could not bear to there very often but it can be alright once in a while. It's a great place to bring out of town visitors. I am not fan of waiting outside or in a dark hallway for hours. I know call me crazy. I really don't get why there is always such a long line of look-at-me's ��waiting outside a bar who's theme is not being seen. The drinks are really really good if you appreciate cocktail crafting. And anywhere they outlaw Grey Goose is fine by me.
"If this rating were based on food alone, Wakamono would get 4-5 stars from me. Unfortunately, as countless other posters have written, the service is deplorable. These entire staff has such an incredibly entitled,, snobby attitude, it's turned me off for good. They recently refused to honor a gift card and when we pressed the manager on the issue, she started yelling, ""I'M NOT WRONG!!"" and threatened to call the police. Who does that?! I cannot imaging going into any other restaurant and having the manager, of all people, whine and scream like a child. Such a disappointment."
"never realy had mexican street food, but thought everything here was tasty. I came with a big group and everyone pretty much thought everything was great! I personally liked the short rib torta. I'll def be back and try everything on the menu"
"Best. Meal. Of. My. Life. Amazing and fun service.Tyler and Nat, in particular, really took our entire dining experience to such a wonderful level."
Went on a suggestion of a friend. ��Great place. ��Food very good. Waitress was great and knew the food. ��Had a wonton encrusted crab cake ...it was a special so good..Also brought a bottle of wine. ��Was a great experiance...I will be back
"our first visit to Zed was more than fantastic. We enjoyed more than a dozen different dishes prepared by the chefs with unbelievable service. Our server, Kevin, paired our meal with an unbelievable wine and was nothing but attentive. The experience at this place paired with the service was nothing but outstanding. The food is well priced as is the wine. Our server was able to suggest something in our range of style and price with minimal effort. This restaurant is a must for all."
"Very expensive, but absolutely worth it! Delicious and uncommon!"
"I agree with a previous reviewer that the appeal of this place is mysterious. ��We too made a reservation, and still had to wait 30 min. ��The food was lack-luster. ��We were doubly disappointed to find out that one of their options for restaurant week (roasted apple crepes) had been replaced by chocolate flan. ��Not tasty at all. ��The atmosphere is loud, and the space is arranged such that you feel like you are in an airport hanger. ��Obnoxious."
"A Cautionary Tale:The food was fine, and the bartender (Pepe) was fine. We were there on Cinco de Mayo. It was busy, but that wasn't bad either. My wife went to the bathroom. She was washing her hands & someone else flushed the toilet. All the cold water shut off, and she scalded her hand. She was shaking in pain. Her hand was burned when she got back to the bar. The bartender gave her a napkin with ice, which helped ease the pain. When we went to leave, I told the THREE people behind the counter what happened. TWO of them LITERALLY TURNED AWAY FROM ME WHILE I WAS TALKING. The other guy leaned back, folded his arms, and asked, do you want to talk to someone about that? I thought that was what I was doing. I reiterated that I was telling them this to prevent others from getting hurt, and su"
"I know I'm in the minority here but this place was gross!!! Servers hounding you from all corners, helping you with chairs and putting napkins in your lap I couldn't even have a conversation, then there's the meat. These guys dressed like Zoro (a lot of bells and whistles with this place) they come over with these bloody, bloody meat husks. The place smelled like meat, I came home smelling like meat. So if you like cow blood you'll love this place."
"I live in Champaign-Urbana and haven't been up to Chicago often, so I just learned that Sun Wah has moved to a new location which has a bigger and nicer setting. I ordered Wonton Soup with BBQ Pork and it's delicious as always. Soup was well balanced, not bland or salty. BBQ Pork came, however, with a bit of smell. Wontons were hugh and they were stuffed with tender ground pork and shrimp .. yummy!Great price, good food!!!"
"We had dinner there friday for my bday, and was pleased with the services but im sorry to say that today we found out the restaurant charged our account 2 times, one on friday and then again on monday. ��my BF called about 10am and there no answer, i called and was told that a manager would call me back at noon. ��when we received no call back by 1pm, my BF called again and was told that the manager was too busy to talk to him and all they could give us was a transaction number that we already knew from the receipt. ��we were a party of 4 and our bill was over $300. ��VERY DISAPPOINTED in the management and will not ne recommending this place to anyone."
"Pretty good pizza, I've had better and worse. I wouldn't write home about it."
"I ran into the manager Alberto and he is just AMAZING! ��He explained how he came up with the idea of putting the platano maduro into the sandwiches and I must say, genius idea! I LOVED THE FOOD and the service was superb!"
"I LOVE the Grand Lux Cafe. ��I would have to say that I would choose this restaurant over the Cheesecake Factory, although they both rooted from the same business. ��I usually go here for special occasions, and I always have a great time! ��The environment is spacious and the decor is really something. ��The pasta with chicken and sundried tomatoes is my favorite, and their Mango Ice Swirl is delicious! ��Their martinis are very tasty too. ��I would recommend this place to anyone."
"My daughters and I had brunch at Frontera Grill June 25, 2011. We had been so looking forward to this meal and were totally shocked and disappointed. The only saving grace was the margaritas. The guacamole and tostaditas de ceviche were tasteless. The cazuela de Tinga, enchiladas de Mole and duck tacos, salty and served room temperature as were the sides. We are foodies, watch Mr. ��Bayless on PBS and chef shows and know he too would be shocked at our meal and service. One of the worst dining experiences ever!"
I'm a fan of burritos. An even bigger fan of these guys burritos. Just thinking about the juicy seasoned steak complimented by the spicy salsa they give me on the side makes my mouth water. And then I can't stop there. I keep thinking about the mellow guacamole that ties in the crunch of the onions so they work in perfect harmony to provide happy taste buds with what it was looking for. ��It's cheerful waiters always willing to help and the heaping portion of meat that will forever keep me from ever being a vegetarian and will keep me coming back on a Saturday night when i don't feel like cooking.
Nice food after a long night on the town!Steak burrito and Chille Relleno's!
"Piece Pizza on North Avenue is one of the best places I've found in Chicago to get a microbrew and one heckuva good tasting pizza. ��They've got all types of unique offerings, including mashed potatos on pizza (although it's not the best in their arsenal). ��There Camel Toe beer is amazingly good. ��I definitely recommend this Bucktown institution."
"Great food, decent service and a fun atmosphere. ��Rum glazed pork shoulder was fantastic. ��Definitely worth trying."
Unless you know someone here - be prepared to wait - almost always. ��But worth the wait... the fries are indeed amazing! ��And the Bloody Marys do not disappoint
"THE BEST $50 you will spend..not for vegetarians...filet mignon wrapped in bacon, parmesan crusted pork, awesome service our x=mas party is here every year!!!!!!!!!"
"WOW! great food at an unbelievable price. ��A dinner for 2 came out to under $15 with tip. ��Tacos were great and the guacamole was also very good. ��My only small complaint was the chips tasted a bit stale but as a free extra and considering that everything else was so good and so cheap not even a big concern. ��Fantastic food overall although thinking back on it, a little scary that all the food could be so cheap and still be approved for eating. ��Hiding that thought deep in the brain, the food was fantastic and will be going back many a time."
One of my favorite Greek restaurants in the area! Great food and great atmosphere. Thank yoU!
"This is our favorite place to get sushi in the city! ��I had a craving for their Maui Waui roll after a long day this weekend and called in my order for takeout. ��The rolls were ready to pickup in less than 30 min and hit the spot perfectly. ��Michael, the manager, knows his customers and is always friendly and professional. ��I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fresh and inventive sushi dinner with consistently great service!"
"So, I am at my sisters for the weekend. We shopped all day in various shops. Now we are starved. She jumps on Yelp and looks for great burgers. WOW!!! the reviews on Fifty/50 were right on. The staff was awesome. They offer real burgers with a twist and sweet potato fries. Fantastic!"
"I'm a big fan of the show Top Chef and ever since Rick Bayless won Top Chef Masters I had a mission! I was in Chicago a few weeks ago and I was determined to go to Frontera Grill even if I have to wait 5 hours! I wanted to see for myself if he really is the best in whipping up Mexican Fine Dining. We just came out of Gino East for lunch and stuffed like we were never going to eat another meal, but we walked to Frontera Grill determined to make a reservation for the night (since they told us over the phone that they are no longer taking any reservations only sign-in so we actually have to physically be at the restaurant - insanity!!) You can seriously see the line out the door a mile away from Frontera Grill - we were thinking darn this place must really be good! We got there at 4pm,got in "
The food is wonderful

"OK, first, I don't like national chains. ��Second, I don't like dropping fifty bux a head on dinner. ��Third, I gotta tell you, these people are frigging geniuses. ��Here's their game.You walk in the door. ��It's 50 bux a head for dinner, so, naturally, you're expecting to be wowed. ��You grab a plate and dive into the best salad bar on earth. ��Your stomach starts working.You get to your table and there's a never ending supply of carbs. ��Bread, potatos, bananas, polenta. ��You dive in.Then the meat comes. ��A parade of meat. ��An orgy of meat. ��But your belly is already half-full. ��They slice the meats real thin so you can try lots of different kinds of meat. ��But the fact is that you're already pretty full, and there's only so much you're going to put on your plate at once that you can enjot the "
1 falafel.1 zatter bread. 3 long black hairs.
"Everyone knows about the salad bar at RJ Grunts, but you need to try the grunt burger as well because it is very good. The wait can be long at times, but I've never waited for more than 20 minutes. The service is fast once you sit down since most of the customers are helping themselves at the salad bar."
"This place is great for a good sandwich or salad. ��They're open late and have a very nice ambiance, all for not too much money. ��A go to for me."
"great food, great martinis, great service! I haven't had this bad of a food coma in a while."
"For the price and convenience of hours, I give this place 4 stars.It isn't the cheapest place or most expensive place. ��It is big on the bbq and remember that you might come out smelling like it too. ��All the food is good, the bbq, the soups, the cooked dishes, and the side dishes. ��I never got any of the Japanese food so I can't tell you how those are.What I don't like is sitting on the floor. ��They have a side wall area that is all floor seating. ��I ache while I eat, it is inconvenient. and it's even more difficult to get the server's attention.Go here for some good Korean food, but be ready to sit on the floor if the sitting tables are all full."
"I've heard such great things about this place but how the heck do you get in?? Twice now I've gone for pizza and as early as 7:30-8pm there was an hour and a half wait for 2 people?? I think after people eat they stay there and sit and watch the bar area or the t.vs. They should really move their people out when their done. And the funny part about this is that I emailed them and asked what's a better time to come in for pizza, and their reply was...LUNCH TIME! great! so I work for 8-5 every day and the only way I can try this pizza is at lunch time? Why does everyone else get to enjoy a dinner there but I cant? �� I think the waiting time to eat is ridiculous but I will go back and try AGAIN just to see what the hype is all about. They do have a great beer selection."
"This place has amazing sushi. the fish is always so fresh and the rolls are so unique. We go there for dinner a lot and order delivery as well. Try the spicy scallop roll and the spicy tako (sp?).The reason for my 4 star rating is due to the following: A) service is not great. The women always seem so mad when you order another glass of wine after you've finished all of your food. I mean, come on, I just ordered 90 dollars worth of food and want to have another glass of wine, and you are gonna give me a dirty look cuz you want the next party to be seated. I get it, there are ppl waiting, but I shouldn't be rushed out of my table by having a check placed in front of me, when I still wanted to order something else.B) the cash bar is cool, trendy and upbeat. But what is up with the smoke maki"
i was there with firends Friday night. i am so happy demera is two blocks away from us. ?the servers are beautiful!!!! ? ?I am going back to demera to see my Favourite waitress ?lol is that rude or funny? but am serious !! ? the food is Delicious. ?try to get the combination and the beef spicy dishes. ?go Demera!!
"I have patronized the Violet Hour on several dark and mysterious occasions. ?But after my last ?surreal experience, I will never be able to divorce this humble imbibery from the illustrious and otherworldly server they call the Falcon. ?That mythical beast took me on a detour, no, no, more like a flight, to the marvelous majesty of Epicurean ecstasy. ? ? ? ?From the onset, I was curious of his manner and why someone of his apparent prestige would be working as a cocktail waitress. ?With his slicked-back hair and gilded vest, he bore the air of an ostentatious peacock. ?His manner elicited the impatience of a toddler as equally as the tranquility of a sage. ?And from a question so formally frivolous as How are you? ?he launched into an unending diatribe about his recent experiences travelin"
If you want to eat until you get ready to say stoppppp bringing me food.This is the right please to go..The food is terrific meaning delicious.........
"I wanted to try Coast so badly based on all the good reviews and recommendations from people. ��I made reservations for a Friday night. ��I was pretty disappointed with the table we were given, which was right in the middle of traffic, but they had nothing else available. ��The restaurant was very crowded and so loud that we could hardly talk to each other without shouting. ��We could, however, easily hear the lady one table over with a loud, aggravating voice. ��It is a really big place for a sushi restaurant, and it doesn't look like much has been done to reduce noise issues and keep an intimate atmosphere. ��So my much-awaited Coast excursion had a very rocky start. ��The sushi, however, was extremely good. ��If it weren't for the amazing sushi, I probably wouldn't bother going back. ��But I wil"
"The food here is unbelievably delicious!! If you get here late on weeknights or weekends this place is packed beyond imagination...so be prepared to wait at least an hour o be seated. But trust me it'll be worth the wait. Also, be ready to make new friends because 80% of tables are shared seating"
"A good vibe and even better food makes Uncommon Ground worth the stop. ��The fish and chips are worth waiting for, and the meatloaf is a heartwarming meal if that's what you crave. ��Every Friday in the summer and fall they have a farmer's market; the one time we went they also had a pig roast, which we enjoyed while waiting for a table. ��They have their own garden on the rooftop along with solar panels to power their water heater. ��The service was great, and my only wish is that they would have opened up this location earlier."
"Absolutely, hands down, best deep dish pizza in Chicago. ��Please open a place in the Twin Cities and educate the masses on what a deep dish pizza experience should be."
"you go on Saturdays at 12am, it's great.. see you soon"
"I think I am becoming a connoisseur of Churrascarias. ��I only wish they were like in Brazil, but what we have in the states is pretty good. ��If you like meat, this is where to go. ��Lots of choices and lots of meat. ��To make the experience perfect, fast all day before you go and be prepared to overeat! ��I like Fogo de Chao because it is more elegant and upper class than the others I have gone to. ��The meat is good, it could have been a little juicier, but some cuts were fantastic. ��At churrascarias, different servers continually come by with different cuts of meat until you tell them to stop. ��A meatlover's dream!"
"You want great food at a low cost?...done! You want amazing service with a giant smile?...done!! Our server (Chris) was in his first week, that's right his first week and he was all over it. If he wasn't 100% sure, he didn't BS, he simply got the answer. My first experience couldn't have gone any better, from the first person to greet my friend and I (Raul), my server (Chris) , the manager (Diann) and the owner Alberto, these guys just want to do it right...and they have done it. The appi's were good, entrees were great and the BYOB service was awesome...the no cork fee and buckets of ice for the brews was a plus. You want to enjoy a no-fuss lunch or dinner, treat yourself to a great experience at the Logan Square 90 Miles...ask for Chris...he won't disappoint."
"Great food, great service, and great atmosphere. When you go, stay hungry and try the ""O"" Face burger, it is one of the best burgers I've ever had and gives Kumas Corner a run for there money. Great place to bring a group of friends to simply have a good time. You won't encounter a bunch of deuche bag's giving you hard looks in the place. The staff is super friendly and efficient, no matter how busy it gets."
OMG!! ��that is all I have to say about this place! ��I have never had Pancakes this good! ��they are not just pancakes its like a meal and desert all in one! ��Yummy!! ��The coffee is also very tasty!! ��would recommend to everyone!
"I normally don't like hot dogs as much, find nothing special about them and quite frankly, kinda boring. Hot Doug's makes them special and definitely not boring!!! The specials are just a feast, a dish that transcends the usual definition of a hot dog.Trust Doug on the toppings, he knows what he's doing, blue cheese and honey on a wild boar sausage was a divine combination. My wife decided to go with the usuals on her duck sausage despite Doug's quizzical looks and quite frankly, the mustard, ketchup and relish kinda overpowered the taste.The duck fat fries are as good as they are famous, but not just as heavenly as I thought they would be, given what happened to the hot dog. Still the best fries I ever had."
"I'm in the industry and greatly appreciate the product, pace, and atmosphere offered by the Violet Hour.Any comments about this place being too pretentious and folks having problems with the rules? Those folks should get over themselves.The rules? No cell phones, no baseball caps, no Jagerbombs or similar bombs. The other rules amount to something along the lines of order off the menu, drinks and otherwise and don't act like you're a complete ass and like the world revolves around you and you alone. I know, it's asking a lot for some folks.If you want to order a pitcher of Bud Light, shots of Jameson, a mundane cosmo, or chicken tenders or a burger and fries with a kosher pickle accompanied by yellow mustard and Heinz ketchup, even though it isn't on the menu, this isn't the place to go, t"
"I won a dinner to his restaurant so I was very excited; not to mention I traveled from Seattle. ��We were seated and then brought a strange munchie of popcorn followed by duck pate shaped liked lolllipops on a stick and lightly dipped in ""pop rocks, the candy."" ��I thought it was a joke and tried not to laugh. Are you kidding me? Duck pulvarized liver dipped in pop rock candy? So, the experience went downhill from there. My Mom had some of the popcorn, but we had it taken away when she literally picked three long hairs out of her mouth, the food was insanely overpriced and indulgent and I wish we would have walked out after the liver/pop rocks joke. ��When we were standing at the door waiting for our cab another guest asked me if I was off to get a hamburger."
"After reading all the good reviews my husband and I decided to try this place out. ��This restaurant has no air conditioning, it was so hot that we had to order our food to go. ��The food was fair, the servers were friendly and helpful. ��This place definitly has a Miami feel. ��Don't think I will be going back...no Wow factor here"
"I consider myself to be nutritionally focused, value and take pride in what I eat. I also frequent various organic and health oriented restaurants quite often in the City of Chicago. This location was highly recommended by someone I know, but unfortunately my time there was not pleasant at all. Upon entering the restaurant we were approached in a way that was rather uncomfortable, however they thought the remark made was complimenting, but it wasn't. The server was not pleased with my pleasant rebuttal, so she continued to ignore me through out my entire time there. ��The cappuccino served was horrible, and the remake was even worse. ��The bus boy was more pleasant and attentive than the waitress. The chef was great. But I will not frequent this place again, nor recommend it to any of my FB "
Perfect pizza. Friendly Staff. Great job.
I went here on a school field trip to experience middle east cuisine and it was fantastic. ��I loved the flavors of the humans with falafel in a pita bread. ��The service there was friendly and very helpful with telling me what everything was. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.
BYOB! ��Great sushi!
"I came here for my birthday with 5 other people and let me tell you you need more than 20 mins to look at the menu to choose what you would want to eat. ��I am indecisive and there were so many good options to choose from! I got the phillip's crab cake. ��It was good but the corn that came with it was amazing! It was like their own spin of elotes (corn with mayo, cheese, butter, chile). ��The crab cakes was a little dry but my niece had the ribs and that was really good as well! ��My borfriend got the pork chop because he is allergic to seafood and I would not reccomend it. ��It was a little on the plain side. ��Did I mention that it's BYOB? ��They have a lot of fancy beers and wines on the back for $6+ on the back of the menu but it isn't worth it. ��I had a Delirium which was 10$. I came on a We"
"I had heard good things about the quality of the sushi here on the Sunday bunch. We started with some green tea for beverages. I wasn't impressed with it: it came in a packet and was fairly bland, but I'm not an avid tea drinker.Our server was very nice: not the fake nice, and not rude. I'm always weird about fine dining, it makes me feel awkward and out of place, like I'm trashy or something. It's swanky, but not too fancy. It was a little small.We just got the basic maki rolls: tuna, salmon, and, california rolls. ��I must say, the taste was great! It was flavorful and very fresh, probably the best sushi I've tasted yet. My only complaint is that it's pricy and the pieces are pretty small."
"I missed Korean BBQ so much these days and searched reviews on Yelp and found this restaurant. ��My fiance and I wanted to give a shot, so we drove on Saturday with too much traffic on Western Ave, (for us, it took for 55 min to get there from downtown) IT IS REALLY WORTH TO GO THIS RESTAURANT!!!Some of reviews here said, if not Korean, they don't serve good?! ��I think that is because many Asian restaurants (especially authentic ones), servers mostly speak their own language, and a little English, so it's difficult them to explain a lot about the food at restaurant in English... ��I assume. ��Mostly, if you ask what they recommend, they'll tell you what is popular or not. ��Smell, probably is going to be a problem if you want to go out after the meal here. ��They use charcoal to BBQ, and you do"
"Alinea was everything we expected from one of the world's greatest restaurants. ��The amazing and unbelievably creative food was sublime (and giggle-inducing at times in its novel presentation!) and the service could not have been more attentive and unpretentious. �� The is a very fun place to eat, albeit very costly. ��Still, given the amount of effort each dish requires and the quality of the ingredients, it is worth every penny. ��This is a special place for a special occasion, unless you happen to be wealthy. There are just two suggestions we have which could make this restaurant even better.One, given that diners are encouraged to touch many parts of their dishes and food with their hands, it seems incredible that hot, moist towels are not offered to clean one's hands before the dining ex"
"Room to move. Pretty, thoughful drinks. An elegant night. Thank you."
"The line is worth standing in.With so many so so hot dog places in Chicago, this place stands above the rest. BY FAR the best place to get a hot dog in Chicago. The line moves pretty fast fyi."
"Absolutely fantastic! Loved the food, the ambiance and our server (Heather)...my new favorite place!"
Love your hot dogs Doug.Thanks for the great food and friendly service.
"Great vibe at this place. ��Relaxed but efficient servers who are obviously confident in their product! ��It was 3:30 PM and we hadn't eaten all day. ��Fortunately they had a transition menu (between lunch and dinner) with great choices. ��We had a premium burger with sweet potato fries. ��The burger was a thick homemade patty, lots of fresh fixings, and just enough bun to hold it together. ��The chopped salad had crisp veggies with smoked chicken. ��The plain old cheesecake with candied (and salted) orange rinds was plain old delicious.We are from the West Coast and felt right at home here."
"This place is just ok. ��it would get a higher rating from me if i didn't have to stand in line that long. ��Did they cook my dog when i showed up? ��They must have because it wasn't hot by any definition, i would say warm. ��The fries are ok as well but not for my taste, i like crispy thin cut fries, and these were a little on the thick side and all mushy from being in too much grease. ��The price isn't expensive but two of us had dogs, shared a fry, and had two drinks. ��I remember the price being almost $20 which it was after i put the change in the tip jar ( I always tip). ��I have two other favorite hot dog spots that i would never dare mention because if i had to wait that long for a hot dog again I am moving out of the city, maybe even state."
Always great!
"I really love going here every once and a while. ��They always have a new exotic type of encased meat. ��Where else can you go to eat bear sausage, ostrich sausage, or alligator sausage. ��Pair any of those with the right kind of cheese and condiments, you have yourself a winner. ��And there are plenty of winners on this menu. ��My only objection is the price. ��It is a bit steep. ��But then again, you are eating exotic meats. ��It is not an everyday thing, but definitely worth going to every so often."
"Went with my wife tonight, had a great meal and great service, thanks to all the great staff, especialy Raffi our server. Had the 12oz steak, best I've had in a long time, it was cooked perfectly."
The food was good i dont know much about country but this was good and the potatoes were amazing so full of flavor. The breakfast special was delicious and totally worth every penny! I will be going back soon!
My first time there and boy was it packed! We did get seated really quickly though unlike some of the groups after us. Very clean establishment and the pancakes and hash were good!
"I've eaten a ton of great meals at a ton of great restaurants, and let me tell you, Sprout is the real deal. ��The only thing i can compare it to was my last dining experience at Trio before it closed (sigh). ��The food is a hug from the inside, the service is exceptional, the room is warm and inviting, the wine list is well thought out, and jesus... i'm still in a food coma the next day! ��Bold, fresh, crazy-good flavors that elevated things like a simple salad and a sip of soup to what you're probably gonna smell on God's breath when he meets you at the pearly gates. ��I no longer hate licorice thanks to this restaurant... go there and figure out what i mean. ��I'm a former Chicago peep, now dwelling in Indiana, and there's a new reason to make the trek back. ��Sorry, Charlie, but Lincoln Park"
chef bayless and staff are great cooks and honor the mayan and azteca traditional style of cooking w/ all colorful and tasty ingredients.thanks chefcal shummonmissionnairesdusaint-esprit/president
Great food and good atmosphere. ��The only reason it is a 4 and not a 5 is because their margaritas are a bit expensive. ��BUT...they are delicious :)
soooo good
"Had a family birthday dinner last night. Fun looking spot, cute area of the city, nice menu. Our service was so bad, we would never come back. We were a table of 8 people....most servers would see dollar signs and know they could keep the drinks and food coming. Our server just kept dissappearing. He also brought out the food in a crazy order so people could not all eat together. Food was pretty good, but not good enough to offset the service."
"I had my baby shower there last weekend, and it was so fun having it at a Brazilian steak house. It made the atmosphere fun and entertaining. Here are all positives from my shower 1. Brazzaz Staff was so accommodating they made it simple for everyone involved 2. The food was hot, and it allowed for my guests to mingle and enjoy themselves, even though they were at a baby shower 3. The wait staff was so good, I honestly was so impressed 4. The management had my car pulled up, and the wait staff carried all my gift into our SUV All I have to say is well done Brazzaz, it was a perfect day!"
"I used to like going to Glenns Diner because it was a local quick bite to eat. ��Wow, have they changed. ��Making a reservation there is like pulling teeth- with lists and timing... they aren't that friendly either when they answer the phone. ��The food is good, but to get seated has turned me off from this retaurant."
"What is all the rave about with a tough-ass steak that never changes form no matter how much you chew it?Our night at Las Tablas started with the hostess telling us there would be a half hour wait...no problem. That turned into a little over an hour...fine, I can deal. We were lucky enough to finally get a seat at the bar after waiting about 45 minutes. Had an opportunity to try one of their drinks: Colombian rum with muddled strawberries and brown sugar. It was quite good and refreshing, though I couldn't taste the brown sugar at all. After being seated, we tried the Empanada Combo Plate: two each of chicken, beef and cheese, all of which were good. These were accompanied by a green sauce (Chimichurri?) which was good as well. The menu stated that two sauces were served with their meals. "
"I love this place, food is great and portions are very generous. ��The appetizers can be in place of a meal."
The atmosphere is cool but the service is slow.
Delicious! ��I am in awe of their portobello ��and goat cheese panini. �� And their carry-out is mighty quick. ��This place gets hoppin' so I like to order ahead and eat my 'wich at the park instead of waiting for a table.
"love this place. i used to go all the time to study or hang out with friends. good coffee and teas. breakfast is great. went back not too long ago and the place hadn't changed that much - at least not the atmosphere. but then again, it didn't need to - it was great to begin with..."
"Fast and friendly..great service. Food was hot, delicious, and well presented. The omelettes and fried potatoes are amazing! Good prices! Highly recommend."
"I'm a pretty frequent visitor, this place is always fantastic each and every single time I come.The food is deliciously fresh, I'm always really fond of the coconut and mango beef. however this weekend they offered a very delicious dungeoness Crab which is not usually offered but Tuan (the owner) put it on the menu just for this weekend only.It was amazing! delicious, and scrumptious!I'm pretty picky with seafood but this was absolutely amazing, and with brown rice it made the meal taste all the better.now I'm mouth watering for some more... yummmm"
"Real Greek from the food to the service. The food is great and the service is traditional Greek service, kind of rude and short but helpful and funny."
Just tried Sunda for ��the first time tonight. ��I am new to the sushi thing and was a bit nervous to go to such a posh place. ��WOW! ��Everything was wonderful and it was due to a great server. �� Her name is Melissa if I remember correctly and she was the best from start to finish. ��We explained that we were newbies and she offered to order for us! ��She asked some questions about our likes and dislikes and did her thing. ��It was such a fun and interesting experience to have someone do this for us. ��She hit the nail on the head. ��She made us feel comfortable and taken care of. ��I highly recommend giving this place a try. ��I might not go in on a weekend because of the apparent crowds but will definitely go back on a weeknight for more experimenting!
A+ have to say this place has some of the freshest seafood and i have lived. In California before.
"If ��you want to spend $20.00 on a hot dog, fries and a shake this is the place.Great food and also The most EXPENSIVE Hot dog i have ever had."
"This is a nice place to take your family. Their cheese is under their sauce and the ingredients are always fresh. I even happen to like their cornbread crust. I'm typically left full with just a single slice, so make sure to come here hungry!"
"no doubt, the best korean in the city, great stuff!!"
"The best service ever, just love this place, the food is great and the salad bar OMG... this place is a 10 star restaurant (:"
"Food - small portions - think snack sizePrice - big price for small snackWait Staff - mehWait time - lousy - especially for middle of week early dinner. got put on wait list at 6pm, didn't get seated till 7:30, got appetizer at 8:10.Environment - meh... inside loud and noisy, outside - weather gods made up for the serviceRecommended for: go if you aren't hungry, and want to hang out"
"I've been to VH 5 or 6 times and there is a lot to like and dislike about it. Dislikes: It is really, really expensive. There is an obnoxiously long line. (On purpose. There are open tables.) It is a bit pretentious just for the sake of being pretentious. Very popular with the Crimson Lounge dirtball/ slimeball crew. Likes: The drinks are awesome. Very unique, well crafted, great ingredients. The decor is interesting and unique. VH definitely provides something different from most bars. If you're looking just to go get a good drink and hang out, I would skip Violet Hour. If you want to show some friends from out of town a cool spot try it out."
"Our wait was 1 hour, but ended up being 1.75 hours before we was seated. ��The manager took great care of us with complimentary drinks and appetizers and made the whole experience much better.Definitely going back!"
"LMAO....Ok, so here's the deal. ��I've read some of the reviews about Spacca Napoli, and they make me fall out of my chair.What people complain about is exactly what is authentic and special about this place. ��I grew up in Naples, Italy (authentic pizza capital of the world) and this place offers the closest thing I have ever tasted in the States. ��That, along with offering very high quality products and the use of very high end ingredients, ranks this place among my absolute favorites. ��I cannot compare this to other Chicago pizzerias, simply because you walk out of here spending way more then you would if you were to go to regular place. ��Think of it as a place where you would go for a special occasion, not your weekly trip to satisfy your pizza craving.Spacca Napoli offers a pizza novelt"
We spent Vday at Kinzie Chop house! Hand down the best steak I have ever had. I mean ever. They also gave us two complementary glasses of Champagne. Very nice touch! Worth the price and the service was impeccable.
"Love this place , well cooked food, tasty and good portions .Comparable prices ��and this particular Garcia's has on street parking . The other one on western has no parking and is all ways crowded .The bar has good spirits @ comparable prices and there is plenty of cozy seating for your significant other or the kids ."
"Having been to both Miami & Colombia, I can say this place has great Colombian food. I love the bandeja paisa, but they have great steak plates as well. I'd never had baby octopi, but they were great too. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere, which includes lots of Colombian art, is very nice. Drinks are good too. Can get a bit loud at times though."
"I know that what I am about to write has all been said already, ��about this gem of a foodie heaven... But I feel like I need to express my heart felt feelings for my [gushing] NEW LOVE.... ohhh purple pig, I want to scribble your name all over my notebook like a blushing school girl.... I am often in Chicago for business, so try hard to get a taste of the dining scene as much as possible. ��.. I heard about this semi new place last week when I landed, and I had tunnel vison about coming to try it...I finally got the chance on a Sunday for lunch. The look right away made me like I was going to love ��the place... communal tables, wine barrels, & pigs everywhere. The bar had hand painted looking pottery with forks, knives and spoons in them, which added to the home feel. When I looked at the m"
"Super kitschy and fun to go to. ��The hot dogs are superb Chicago style dogs and the fries are tasty. ��Also got a Black Cow which was good as well. ��The pickled tomato is a nice touch as well. ��Between the food, the ambiance and the nostalgia Superdawg invokes, I will definitely go back."
"My family and I have been going here since I was little and it's probably my favorite place to go in Chicago to eat. ��It's where we take family if they haven't been to Chicago, it's where we go with a lot of people to celebrate. ��It is a lot of food for cheap, it tastes excellent and is filling.Their burritos are probably what they're most famous for and they're excellent. ��Dinners and Tortas are also very good but you should probably share with one other person because they are huge and maybe even more filling than the burritos. ��As far as I know the food is authentic (enough for me anyways) but whether or not it is it's delicious."
"Their wine flights, cheese selections, and olives are fabulous. I always sit at the bar."
"Saturday, September 18th - Reservation - 8pm. After a terrible experience at a competitor the night before, this was a refreshingly great experience. The food was great, service was great, and we were seated shortly after our reservation time. The food was seasoned very well, not too salty or overwhelming. The staff replaced plates after each serving such that we never ate from dirty plates. We will definitely be returning to this restaurant!"
"Had the stir fried noodle with seafood and it was so good. �� The sauce is very flavorful with plenty of veggies and seafood (fish balls, shrimp, squid). ��Big portions, inexpensive for city prices and good service."
"Ambience and presentation is really what this place has to offer.Sushi was good, but nothing out of this world. ��I do want to give mention to the spicy tuna rolls...they were quality, and different from what I am used to, which makes them good. ��Service is greatThe place is pricey...and I can't justify paying that much, when there are better places that are cheaper.If your looking for a cool trendy hipster place to go out with your friends, this place will do the job. ��I wouldnt go out of my way for this place, but wouldn't mind going back."
"Just OK, If you are trying their gluten free items I would say don't. I had a pasta dish, the only things gluten free and I went home with it after and added things to it from my own fridge. Rice pasta doesn't really taste too much different than real pasta. The amount of things in the dish were minimal and I know for a fact that I could make a better pasta dish gluten free. The bar is great and had my favorite gin, which is important. I don't suggest going here for their gluten free items, if you can't eat gluten. It really is not worth it."
"There are 788 reviews for Piece already at the time of me writing this. Here's one for the count in that its a great lunch spot if you work in the area or end up here during the day! They have cool skylights that let the sun in, awesome beer selection, and neat little tucked away booths"
"The seoul sassy is the best Korean Fried Chicken I have had outside of Seoul. ?The bowls are OK also, but the real attraction is the chicken."
"one word: TRASH. All I have to say is that the one and last time I went to this place it took so long for my speciality cocktail to come that I had to go to the bar. I asked for a ketel one on the rocks, and the pretentious bartender rolled his eyes at me. Trash. I walked across the street to the former Pontiac, and ordered my vodka. When I returned to this trash heap my drink was still not on the table and when it did it was less that satisfactory. P.S. god forbid you bring a cell phone in!"
"These are ironic stars. ��I mean, go Graham Elliot if you ever wanted to go to a place where they point to and explain everything on your plate (and not just yours - the whole table!). ��Or go there is you ever wanted a massive plate with just a drop of food. ��Go to Graham Elliot if you've always wanted the perfect combination of obnoxiously loud music, food which is more theater than taste and service that is robotic and scripted. ��Soooooo pretentious and trying sooooo hard to be cool - go there if you've forgotten how to hate."
"Best hot dogs ever - well, at least as far as reminding me that I went there a lot when I was a kid. �� Hot Dogs have a good flavor, prices are a bit too high. �� Everything is fresh, service is non-personal and in a rush. ��But - it's a Chicago landmark and I love it. ��:)"
"Hella,P.T. Barnum said, ""There's a sucker born every minute."" ��Mr. T. said, ""I pity the fool"" if you shop here you are either very rich or what Mr. T said. ��I find it hard to believe any self-made rich person would so easily part with their loot, but anyway. ��Pambo saw dried cilantro for $18 a pound! ��The selection of speciality items here is impressive, but this place makes Whole Food's pricing seem fair. ��The butcher counter has some truely nice cuts of meat and Pambo could spend $1,000's here if Pambo had money to burn. ��The shoppers here are mucho less annoying than WF Lincoln Park. ��For every good thing here there is something sooo outragiously expensive it balances out."
"My friends and I love going here since it's basically down the block from work. The kalbi is always great...bacon is also good but I won't recommend putting more than 1 order on the grill, and neither will San Soo, because your lung will be cluttered up with smoke when you're about done with the first order. ��Minuses are, a bit worse than average service (they basically just bring you food and sort of give you a hard time if you try to modify your order, esp if you don't speak Korean), and they charge for rice. Pluses are, they open 24 hours 7 days a week, a lot of condiments (come with the entrees), and very good food (i personally don't think the marinated meat is bland and i tend to like very salty food)."
"I love everything about this restaurant! ��It is small, but loud, busy, but extremely friendly. ��The food was to die for! ��The cheese selection is amazing and you absolutely cannot leave without trying the truffle cheese! ��You will be tempted to order it again and again! ��We came here for the wine and the great food reviews, but we were extremely satisfied with the perfection of the entire restaurant. ��Great for families and dinner dates alike. ��We will be back many, many times!"
"So, I heard about a restaurant named Wildfire, and that Michael Jordan himself is a regular. As a consequence, I thought Wildfire would be exceptional. However, our findings did not match our expectations...at all. So, we go to Wildfire in Glenview and dine one day. We ordered 2 bisques and 2 plates of steak medallions - 2 baked potato crusts, 1 bernaise crust, and 1 horseradish crust. First came the soup. It was ok. The ingredients were high quality but the taste was below average. It was as if they put the best possible ingredients into a dish and forgot to put flavor into the dish. Then, the greatest disappointment that I have probably ever had for $19.99 came to our table: the medallion steaks. A medallion, as defined by Merriam-Webster, is, something resembling a large medal; especial"
"This is a great place to really enjoy authentic Mexican found in a real comfortable and original environment. The food is fresh and original, and most importantly tastes great. The service is one to acknowledge, the waitress are friendly and the food gets to you fast and warm. Every time I go the food and the service keeps getting better and better. The restaurant is very easily accessible through either the Lawrence and Western bus or the Western Browline stop. The restaurant is family owned and from Mexican heritage, therefore the food is authentic originates from real Mexican recipes. This place has special meaning to me because we have celebrated many special occasions in this restaurant and until now they have all been great. Overall Garcia's is a great place to eat authentic Mexican "
"This place isn't huge but I'd say just about every dessert they have is absolutely delightful. ��I love the Michelle! ��It's rasberry, PB, and a crunchy bottom all covered in chocolate that is superb. ��My cousins love their macaroons. ��I know a lot of people including my sister who have gotten their wedding cake here. ��It's very beautfiful and delicious all at the same time."
"not all dishes are created equal .. first time i stopped in i tried the carne asada .. thumbs up . real good . decided it was a good place to try again . second time i came i tried the tortilla soup and chicken in green sauce .. thumbs way down . tortilla soup lacked flavor, very bland, basically water n grease . and the chicken in green sauce not good either . overboiled chicken cracked pieces of bone no flavor either .. so i'll only come here for the steak .."
"I think I just do not like Korean food. ��I do not mind the service style, but you can not leave the restaurant without smelling. ��Your clothes just stink overall. ��The food here was good. ��But I just feel like the place is not clean and the cluttered environment."
Handmade pasta is great; Portions are huge; Dining in has always been a good experience
Rated best Shushi in chicago for a reason! Its the best!
"this place was horrible, i made a reservation for my wie and I, after walking by and seeing how amazing it looked from the outside, but after trying it out last night the atmosphere was the only GOOD thing about it. ��The idea of the restaurant is great, but the food sucked. The harvest table is full of COLD salads and vegatables, the meats were OKAY, and the drinks are way over priced. The service was wonderful, but like someone else stated...$200 later and only getting the meal and one drink each...I should have been wowed.This place is for rich hipsters that convince themselves they're having a good meal in downtown Chicago even though they could have had a better meal out outback steakhouse...Save your money and go else where."
"Our food was fabulous, but definitely BYOB. Wine prices were ridiculous!Five times retail is not appropriate anywhere!"
I love me some noon-o-kabob.Great salmon so gooood. and way better then rezaill keep it shortGREAT FOOD!
"After reading many of the reviews of this place and actually trying Sultan's Market, I can only assume that Chicago's population is suffering from a lack of Middle Eastern restaurant choices. I got the lamb dinner and my girlfriend got the chicken shwarma. The lamb was extremely dry and bland, while the chicken was not much better than that found at a reception of a shotgun wedding.To top it off, the guys behind the counter were really suffering from the 'cool factor', rushing everyone along and yelling at one woman taking 5 seconds too long, hey LADY, what do you want... ?Although the hours cater to the working crowd, the Haifa Cafe at 318 W. Adams beats this place hands down with its overall food, freshness, flavor, and attitude."
"although you have to wait outside, it shows that the food must be good and boy was it worth waiting for, I went with a friend who lives in Chicago and another friends kids who we had taken out for the day. one had a child's meal the other joined us in having possibly the best pizza I've had. Lots of meat sausage cheese and that base is the best, the atmosphere in this place was also great with lots of graffiti on the walls they even gave us a pen so we could add ours. cant wait till i visit Chicago again next year"
hands down delicious
BEST FOOD EVER!!! My experience at Nuevo Leon was great! Food was excellent!
"Such amazing food. ��Of all the vegetarian places I've tried, this one is the most likely to please your carnivore friends! ��All your favorite meat flavors are wonderfully re-created in non-meat form. ��Save room for dessert!"
I Have one word ��to sum up my experience AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!This is a must eat at when on Michigan Ave in Chi town.
OMG! ��Hands down the best Italian food ever! ��I have been there at least 5 times already and will be going back for more! ��The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is lovely. ��The food is amazing. ��The ravioli is definitely the best thing I have ever tasted. ��The corn salad was excellent as well. ��The pepper spaghetti was cooked to perfection and the pumpkin gelato was a great finisher. ��I have recommended this place to everyone I know.
"I have been to this restaurant a couple times now and have always been overly impressed with the menu, staff and ambiance. The menu seems to change daily and the prices are more than reasonable especially for the location. I had a bad experience dining in one night when I was caught in the middle of what I thought was an altercation between two customers. It was very uncomfortable and it seemed that no one wanted to intervene as a belligerent drunken women screamed at a man until they finally left the restaurant in disgust. Deciding to return to the restaurant this week I was met again with the face of who I thought was an unruly drunken customer only to later find out this was actually the owner of the restaurant. As I watched her stumble throughout the dining room, wine glass in hand, I "
Top notch steak
"Food was good, service sucked!The grilled salmon was dry with no seasoning. ��The scallops were awesome, the garlic shrimp, awesome as we're the buffalo shrimp. ��Our waitress obviously didn't like her job. ��Might go back."
"Best sushi restaurant in Chicago!!! I've been coming to Sunda since it first opened, and the atmosphere, service, food and beverage quality have always been excellent. The Brussels sprout salad is to die for!!! It's usually difficult to get a Saturday night reservation, but when we can, this is our girls night out go-to spot!"
"Brunch at Longman & Eagle is really special & totally tasty.The most memorable dish of the table was the biscuits and gravy served with one hour eggs. This was a badass breakfast plate: the biscuits were huge and the gravy had bonus pieces of meat throughout! ��But the one hour eggs were the the most amazing thing: Not quite opaque, not quite translucent but a very appealing consistency. The waiter explained that they are cooked in the shell at a certain temperature for one hour and then heated once again before being served. Kind of like an egg sous-vide. I had the smoked salmon plate, which is one of the tamer menu choices. I really wanted to know what grated eggs were...hard boiled eggs, chopped. The plating made this a very special meal. It's served on a large square plate with the ingr"
"Evertything here very good. Always busy, so have patience with the service ( well worth it) Not your typical Italian food, a very modern contemp menu which is ok with me. When dt this is by far my fav restaurant. I would def suggest giving it a try!"
"I went to eat at this Tank Noodle restaurant, and the cashier and waitress there were rude to their customers. It was the worst experience I had from eating at the restaurants. We ordered Pho and Noodle Soups there. As soon after the items were placed on the table, the waitress presented us a check as if they implied that they wanted us to pay and get out of the restaurant. ��When we finished the meal, I went to pay and the cashier made me waited for five minutes while she was talking with her co-worker. The other male cashier stepped in to take to my money."
"I have to say I have never written a review on a restaurant in my life but, this one deserves a fabulous review. ��I cannot say enough about Davanti's!! ��My only concern is that it is almost too good to be true and I just hope they never change their concept!! ��Delicious food and fabulous prices and that goes for the wine too!It is such a treat to go to a restaurant eat, drink, not break the bank and leave with a amazing experience! ��It's the reason we go out to eat! I want to be wowed and Davanti's restored my faith in dining out! ��We had the large ravioli and I have not stopped talking about it!! It was something that I would have never ordered on my own because I do not like eggs. ��I am here to tell you it was divine! It was ��recommended to us and what a recommendation it was!! I can not"
"Food and wine are great, but the reason for the 5 star still reflects from the summer of the bingo party, ��I had the best time. ��There were great wine reps, and the owners were there. My gal was throwing out bingo numbers!!! ��I will never forget the bingo of 2006!! ��Please do more. ��It was the best!!! ��If I missed bingo of last summer than shame on me. ��It was the best! ��Love Bingo!!"
"This would have to be one of our favorite restaurants. They always offer generous portions of delicious food. Be prepared to wait if you go for dinner after six. Some of our favorites would have to be the bruschette and the calamari appetizers, most of the seafood pasta dishes (the menu rotates through the seasons), the pan roasted pork chops entree, and the pizza napoletana. Having a menu of gluten-free pastas is wonderful too."
"The food is above average, service excellent, but the chairs were uncomfortable, atmosphere a little stuffy (picture lots of 50 yr old men with 24 yr old blonds), and the valet staff make a comment to us when we tiped them only $2. ��Parking is pretty much valet parking only in this Northwestern Hospital neighborhood and Jacket required."
"I enjoyed my visit here :) drinks were awesome, food was good, service was a little slow and we had to wait a while for our table even though there weren't many people there. ��Great place for out of towners!"
"Fabulous food, oysters to die for, and a great coastal vibe! Definitely will return to Shaw's"
"Wow. Wow. Came here from the Greek Festival. I got a croissant and a salad with tomatoes, cucumber, green bell pepper, red onion, Kalamata olives, Salonica Peppers, feta cheese, oregano and red wine vinaigrette. It was to die for. the croissant was fresh flakey and straight out of the oven. The salad was also fresh and had a great taste to it. I wish that I can have this for lunch everyday. I highly recommend this place to all passersby. I love the neighborhood its in. You can instantly feel the culture and generations there. They made me feel like I was at home. Indeed I was."
Hot Doug's is literally a dream come true. This place is awesome! I cannot wait to see what random concoction will be made the next time I visit here.
The breakfast was fantastic. Would recommend getting there early if u don't want to wait. Great location.
"I've been eating at Garcia's in Lincoln Square for over 20 years, and I still am hard pressed to find anything bad to say about the place. ��Yes, it can be noisy and the lighting stinks, but the food - oh, the food!! ��It comes to the table piping hot, & delicious. ��The portions are huge so don't overstuff yourself with those home made chips and salsa. ��And save room for the fabulous flan. ��It's always fresh. ��The late hours and great Margaritas make it a perfect destination at the end of a work day or very very late at night!"
Favorite Mexican burrito and beer place. ��They chill the beer glasses with each serving. ��Highly recommend their dark Mexican beer and steak burrito.
"sometimes i have dreams about Irazu's beans, thats right, i said it. ��But I really go for the costa rican sauce, Lisano. ��I would eat my shoe if it were covered in that stuff"
"Loved it!!! Went to 90 Miles on Clybourn with me foodie partner & son Steve & was very impressed. We shared 1 cuban & 1 bistec sandwich & ordered the mariquitas (plantain chips) and headed outside to eat...what a nice surprise we got with every bite. We have never been to Miami for a cuban but we know what we like & we liked it all. I remember the nasty hotdog stand that used to be in that location so my expectations were not all that high but I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience, the service was a 10, the food was a 10 & the outside cafe was a 10 as well. I would suggest you get the garlic sauce that they serve with the plantain chips on the side because it is a bit much when put directly on the chips but other then that a perfect 10!!"
"I just went back this past weekend for Sunday Brunch. ��Not happy to report that the wait time is just as crazy...over an hour for a table of 3. ��Yes, the food is good but NOT that good. ��The service is snobby and rude at times. ��Only when ��someone figures out how a make a decadent breakfast menu - in a bigger space that ��actually accept reservations ��will place change. ��Until then, we are stuck with a long, long waits ��and rude, rude wait staff."
"This is the best place ever! So mad that I didn't think of it first! There is a better Chicago Style hot dog in ?Portage Indiana at Depot Dog, but the encased meats here, my god! true frittes fried in duck fat!?!? Brilliant!! (Fri and Sat only) If you live in chicago and have not been here yet, please back up and move out of the city, you don't deserve Chicago!"
I make sure I eat here every time I am in Chicago!!! I LOVE this place. I wish we had one in Lancaster Pa.. high quality food for a low price. you cant beat it!
"I loved my veggie burger(the Strange Famous!!) & devoured the fries. ��Also, the back room away from the bar is great for families. ��Definitely kid-friendly, with all sorts of games (board games & a few arcade games) and comfortable space for the kids to move around. Our service was smooth, and we were there at 7 pm on a Friday night. Our waitress & servers were very friendly & attentive as was one of the owners. ��We look forward to visiting again soon!"
"Bad Apple has a HUGE beer menu with lots of craft beers you dont find anywhere else, and many are very reasonable - $5 but they have some serious specialty beers too. ��Our server knew a lot about the beers, which was helpful as the beer list is really almost overwhelming! ��The burgers get all the press here, but I am addicted to their ham sandwiches - this is ham like mom makes at Easter - off the bone! no deli meat for Bad Apple. ��Delish fries too. ��The front room has a nice casual atmosphere, the back room is more casual and has a shuffle board and board games."
"Spent couple of days savoring this restaurants food. ?Recommend ?Big Bowl Chinese Soup, Lox, NY Steak. ?Enjoy Bon Appetite. ?Super nice staff also:-) ?Be back soon."
"When I first moved to Chicago, I was living in the Wicker Park/Bucktown area. Everyday I would go exploring in my neighborhood and I stumbled upon this treasure and kept saying I need to go try it, but it definitely looked like a place you go with a friend or a fun group of people. Being new to Chicago, that wasn't really an option at the time, so I held off a few weeks. Ironically, my friend had a mutual contact here that he connected me with. When we were emailing back and forth the logistics of when we were free and I told her where I lived, she demanded we go to Piece. So a few days later, off we went. We went during the weeknight which is most likely the only time you will not have a 2 hour plus wait. We got seated fairly quickly and perused the menu. Everything sounded delicious, but"
"Yummy and cheap. I love this place. Their juevos rancheros is my favorite brunch and they do it really well!The staff is very nice, and i love the random appetizers they give.Just took a friend there for his first time and hes hooked now!"
"I fucking love this place. I work in Lakeview (hence, all of the reviews of establishments in the neighborhood, despite the fact I live about four miles west of there) so I get to eat here about once a week. First, and most obviously, the chicken is tops. Being the whitest of the white-boys, I don't know much of anything about Korean food. Hell, I'm not even sure if this is real Korean food. And, what's more, I don't give a fly-on-the-back-of-a-cow-at-100 miles an hour's ass. It's friggin perfect.I might even go so far as to say that dollar for dollar, this is the best food I've ever had. And the Sriracha sauce on the table... well, huge bonus. Beyond all of that, well, the staff here is totally cool. I always feel welcome and recognized. Crisp once accidentally double-charged my debit car"
"SuperDawg Drive-In, which my mother has been eating at since 1954, makes the greatest hotdog on the entire planet. ��I am a hotdog connossieur and have eaten ballpark dogs, and movie theater dogs, and hotdogs in many U.S. cities. ��Superdawg is the best in the world hands down. ��The address listed here is INCORRECT. ��It's at the corner of Milwaukee and Devon. ��You can't miss the giant HotDog statues on the roof. ��In addition to the best food ever, it's a drive-in and they bring the hotdogs to your car and clip the tray to your window. ��It's like being transported into the past."
"My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate my birthday and it was just perfect! The ambiance of the restaurant was very romantic, just what I was hoping for. The dim candlelight, wine decor, and live Spanish guitar playing made the dining experience that much better. I didn't request any specific seating, but we lucked out and got a nice intimate booth that felt very private. The staff was extremely friendly and knowledgable about the menu and guided us in the right direction of what to order. The service was quick and my high expectations were met! Overall I would rate this as the most romantic restaurant I have experienced in Chicago!"
"Excellent food and quick, too (at least when I went). BYOB is a plus, but I highly recommend the Oatmeal shake!!I'm trying to transition into vegetarianism, so I had the veggie burrito and was pleasantly surprised. Maybe life without meat won't be so bad after all..."
"ate at las tablas and overall it was simply an OK experienceall around the experience left something to be desired.i went during a sunday afternoon and the place was not that busy but the service was not that goodyou had to wait an extremely long time for everything, including glasses of waterthere was no apologies for the lack of timeliness from anyonethe empanadas were too heavy in my opinionand the steak was simply okthe food was not anything to brag about and I had heard many things about this placemaybe i chose the wrong items. ��so i asked a friend that had been there before and she told me what to choose.went back there during a weekdayagain, the place was not busy and the food took so long that we asked them to wrap it togo, ate it later on that night, and by that time it was simply"
It is worth it every time I go.
"Getting lunch for under $20 for two people, which includes a drink, salad, soup, entree, starch and fresh fruit for dessert is unbelievable. My boyfriend and I went here before a trip to the Lincoln Park Zoo...it's in comfortable walking distance and the food is so good. He had the veggie curry, I had the sate chili calamari...both were AMAZING, the calamari in particular. The food is fresh, flavorful and the service is friendly. Great for a date, lunch with friends or dinner with a big group, because it's BYOB!"
Oh the choices!!!! bacon mashed potato pizza....WOW! ��Big place so usually no problem finding a table. ��Above average beer from their own brewery.Totally going back and SOON! I think I just found my new favorite pizza place.
"Yolk was our favorite place since 2007 until the management/owner changed ...or something. The mood of the entire place changed; everyone is in a rush. The guy who takes your tab was rushing us even though there was only one woman behind us. It was very strange. The food is still good, but the service is just really bad. Our waitress was moody and gave us the wrong orders. no apologies. The guy who seats you definitely already looks like the typical restaurant-iere asshole type. This is no longer our favorite spot unfortunately. M.Henry is the new favorite. We'd rather have tight quarters vs being degraded whenever we ��pay them to serve us at Yolk."
"I really did not like my experience at Tru. The atmosphere is weird. It is so bright, that you feel like you're in a lab, not a 5 star restaurant. there is no music. There are 3 servers waiting next t your table, so you can't have a private conversation. It is too uptight. The food was nice, but not spectacular."
"To all the Lincoln Pk/Wicker Pk/Lakeview yuppies and scenesters- please stay far away from this place. ��We don't need you crowding us at the BEST italian joint on the Northside. ��The food is GREAT, service BETTER,and prices are reasonable. ��Please continue overpaying for decent food and crap service at the trendy spots east of Damen, while I kiss the sky at Sabatinos. ��To all others- the Spinach Gnocchi is heavenly, the spinach soup is unbelievable and the wine list is pretty impressive- you must come here (don't forget to tip the musicians)."
"Been here twice, food and service are solid, and we always come away with leftovers. ��A little tight seating-wise, but the food trumps it."
"It's a lovely restaurant. ?The food is good, the service exceptional. ?I was a little disappointed by the Buffalo calamari - a signature dish...found it to be a little too floppy/mushy. ?But, since it's an Italian joint - meaning I got no business ordering such a thing from there anyway - I'll let it slide 'cause everything else was very good."
"Love this place, the pancakes are to die for.Just a hint, the menu you get three pancakes, you can order just one or two. ��One will fill you up because they are so sweet.Enjoy!"
Me and my wife went to Texas de Brazil for the first time last week. I have to say we loved it!!! I am big into finding new experiences... and we found it. Between the carvers bringing the meats table side and the wine / trapeze girl flying around in the wine cooler it was an awesome dining experience. One thing that stood out to me is our waitress.... She recommended a new wine that I have had to purchase a couple bottles since. Duckhorn sauvignon blanc is what she recommended. Her knowledge of the wine list was extensive. Needless to say we will be back soon. It is a wow experience from us.
"I love heavy metal and hard rock. ��I love beer. ��I lover burgers. ��I love the concept of Lockdown. ��I dig that they didn't open just another sports bar. ��But Jesus Christ, turn the f'ing volume DOWN. ��I play in a band that likes to play really loud, but what I experienced in Lockdown one night last week was ridiculous. ��They were showing a live Whitesnake concert and every time Dave Coverdale hit one of his high notes, it felt like someone was taking a drill to my ear drum. ��I was really looking forward to trying one of their self proclaimed ""best burgers in Chicago"" but we ended up slamming our beers and heading over to the Beetle so we could actually carry on a conversation. ��I felt bad for the staff as well - no one had ear plugs. ��At the volume last night, they'll all develop tinnitus,"
"waitress was tired and ready to go,service could have been better, but food was okay,,,,"
"one of my friends has been telling me about the burgers in this place for a while now so i finally had one and it was possibly the best burger ever, clearly by all the other reviews I'm sure you already know that but let me tell you something else that they have that is amazing. we ordered the barbwire and it was amazing, fries covered with cheese, chorizo, onions and other things. i could not believe how good they were. if you go here you must try it. it is a very big portion so splitting it between 3 or 4 maybe even 5 people is a good idea. the only down fall to this place in my opinion is that the beer is a little over priced for me but if you are just into good food and don't need to get drunk this is definitely a great place. specially on a Tuesday when the burgers are half price."
"After reading all the reviews, I felt it necessary to add a little piece of my own! First of all, I noticed the reviews that don't like this place are not very secretive about the fact that ""their"" neighborhood is changing. I don't understand the disdain for the change this place brings to the neighborhood. ��So I wanted to offer an equally biased opinion on the restaurant. Sure there are a lot of people in the crowded bar on friday and saturday nights, but that adds to the character of the place. ��It is a bar after 10 pm on the weekends. But that doesnt take away from every other day when I can bring my dog and sit on the patio for some great food. ��I eat the same things all the time: wings, skirt steak sandwich, and burgers! ��You cannot go wrong with any of these choices. ��I always have a"
"My wife and I were in town for vacation and wanted to try somewhere nice and we weren't disappointed. Service was excellent. We both started with the lobster bisque which was good but could of had a little more lobster in it. Just being a little nit picky though. I had the swordfish, it was cooked perfectly. ��Very flavorful and juicy. ��My wife had the seafood platter which consisted of scallops, garlic shrimp and a crab cake. All were great. As a side I would definitely recommend the au gratin potatoes. ��The portion is big enough for 2. We finished of the meal with desserts of Key Lime Pie and a cobbler with ice cream. ��All very good. Anyone staying in Chicago should go to Shaw's"
i love lao thats one of my fovts now i love their hot pot
This place is great! I stumbled upon it walking to a Bears game one Sunday afternoon. We ordered the fondue and we thouht it was quite tasty!!! My husband and I went for Sunday breakfast and enjoyed it equally more!! The breakfast potatoes with the Brie cheese is so good! the fries with the curry sauce was so delicious too! Will definitely be back!
"Ate at Simply It last night with a group of friends after reading about it in Time Out Chicago, as one of a few restaurants whose owners are in debt given tough economic times and should be experienced. We were very happy with the service! There are over 60 items on the menu & our server gave us great recommendations - portion size was ample. Great for date night or groups. Not loud for dinner conversation. Everyone should check out this undiscovered gem!"
"Admittedly, I'm a fan. I've been coming here for years and decided I should chip in my two cents. I would call the menu true cafe-style: not especially expansive or adventurous but uniformly high-quality, the curried chicken salad and lox plate being standouts. But the reason I'm a regular here has to do with what makes this place unique: it is the rare place where you can go to chill, read, get a great cup of coffee as well as a drink (they have a fully stocked bar) in a great atmosphere. Come for dinner or an afternoon with a book."
You need to try the warden Or the buffalo bill. Sooooo tasty. The muscles are incredible too. Seriously... Get some.
this where I come to re-live the 50's and enjoy very good gyro plates. the pita bread is very good too. I also enjoy the lamb specials. the waiters are great here and the host at the door takes your name down on a clipboard if it is so busy that you have to wait. the place is very large so you shouldn't have to wait but sometimes you do. the host kisses the greek people when they leave or come and I have seen amazing looking dishes on plates brought out to special tables here. I wonder what it would like to be greek and always eat such great food. I like the area the restaurant is in too because the people are very clever and make me feel happy to be around them.
The ABSOLUTE WORST. More than an hour for two gyros to go - when we got home..no toppings. Don't do it!
All you can eat Brazilian steakhouse. Probably the best dining experience I've had in a long time.
"I have been coming to this place since it first opened, I thought it was just what the neighborhood needed and I liked talking to the owner. I recently went on vacation and upon my return I went to have dinner. ��OMG, I never expected to see the menu has changed completely. I can understand if you add new items to the menu or even put specials as an addition, but what I found was another restaurants menu in it's entirely. ��I cannot believe Albert (the owner) has to stoop this low as to take upon someone's menu . I talked to the owner and he told me that he hired a new cook. ��Albert, word of advice; stick to what you do best stop trying to copy what other people are doing, you had a real diamond, you used to be unique, now you are just another Cuban restaurant trying to be like all of the ot"
"Hungry and confused. How is it that I have anxieties about going to my favorite restaurant? Love the food, the service scares me!! I have been a loyal costumer for a year and a half now. Lately I get the same old waitress with no social skills who waits on me every time. I have requested other servers but for some reason she always waits on me. When I first started going to noon o kabab I had random servers.Just as good as the food is so was the service. Maybe I'm just too good of a tipper and thats why I get hoarded by a senior waitress. I don't feel comfortable there anymore. Thats why I am strictly going through the delivery. It's a shame that this gem of a restaurant lacks in service."
"I love the food. ��I love the atmosphere. ��I love the wide varieties of choices. ��I love the Lobster Bisque on the weekends. ��I love the valet parking service. ��They spent a lot of money decorating the place and it shows. ��It's a but pricey, but it's well worth it."
"yes it is as good as it gets....no better!!! If you like meat this is definately the place to be!!! I keep going around and trying new restaurants and steakhouses and came to one conlusion....i like other restaurants but i really enjoy fogo!!! I have no complaints and their salad bar rocks....for desert you have to, have to try the tres leche!!! It will leave you speechless but wanting to return for more!!! ��I give fogo 5 stars because there aren't 6!!!"
"I love this place!!! Always have, even when they looked like an old Greek tavern!Just was there yesterday and had a great time, the drinks were lovely and the food is amazing! Try the baked clams, one of my favorites. The manager is a good guy, always trying to cater to everyone. Love the garlic mash too! mmm Yum! Ever in Chicago, have to try this place!"
My friend and I loved it here! We went for the lunch special after work which was much cheaper than the dinner. OMG. The meat is top notch and the salad bar was the best I have ever had. MUST COME AGAIN.
"It was great! ��Fast & friendly service! ��Although, space was really tight, the food and service was awesome!"
"Wanted to wait until I've eaten there twice to see if it was a fluke or not....The decor is great, staff has always been attentive and amazing, and I have gotten a table within 5 minutes both times.This is the only place in Chicago where I have closed my eyes and savored every bite.... the depth, complexity, just amazing.I love the chicken there... so moist and wonderful. ��Have been impressed with their wine list.Last visit had these gruyere doughnuts with a marscapone..... ��yum yum yum!!!!recommend L&E to anyone who will listen to me gush."
"We've done Bonsoiree twice. The first time was fairly fantastic, except for the desert: a spin on an eggs, biscuit and gravy (the gravy being toffee) - much too sweet while the flavors didn't compliment each other. Nevertheless, the evening was far from spoiled. The BYOB policy is fabulous, plus props to their rabbit - It's the best I've ever had. However, we recently returned in February 2011 and were all somewhat disappointed with the service, ambiance, and even the food. It just seemed... off. The duck-duck-goose came highly recommended, though I found the goose rather salty and the duck bland. The first time round, the atmosphere had been lovely - small but cosy with dim lighting, candles, etc. Stark and cold nicely sums up our second experience. No candles with horridly bright lights,"
"I like the food (specially calamari), but what made HATE this place was that i had few people here in town for christmas time (around dec. 15th) and since i love this place i wanted take them to Calo (around 14 people). Also i would like to say that those people are Executives on finance (Including, Exc. Sales District Managers, Finance Managers, President and Vice President) and me (Sir. International Finance Manager). I was there a friday night and i asked one of the twins about their schedule for sunday and I WAS TOLD from noon to something, since i've just been in that place over 10 times but on week days and saturday night, i didn't really know. Anyway, i went there with all these important people (they were in Chicago just for few hours) and unfort. CALO was CLOSED!!! was amazing!! h"
"Very very Very Good Food!! The food was insanely delicious, the staff was very helpful and friendly, a little pricey but worth it to go once in a while especially for special occasions.. been here twice for my girl friends birthday and once for just because, love it every time! Can't complain..."
"It's rare that my wife and I can find a restaurant that we like as well as our kids. The vegetarian selection is amazing and I highly recommend the gyros. ��The staff is excellent and they brought out our kids mac & cheese within 10 minutes of ordering. ��Needless to say, our kids were happy which allowed my wife and I to enjoy our dinner!"
Yum Yum double Yum! All I have to say is Duck Fat Fries!
"I tried to go here for dinner with my family around 6pm this evening. The group included 3 adults and 2 kids, 1 needing a high chair. The host refused to seat us at any of the 4 tops available stating that it would be a fire hazard to have a high chair at any of them. There were several available. ?He even had the nerve to tell me go home and put your kids to bed then come back without them to eat! ?Are you kidding me!?! ?I have been here several time before but after being treated so rudely I will not go back! Why not just post a sign on the door NO KIDS ALLOWED!"
I really thought this restaurant was great but I was really disappointed today. First when I called the location on Clybourn a young lady answered the phone and gave my the assumption that she didn't want to take my order. I've been to this restuarant several times and the men were extremely nice and helpful but I usually go before closing. Today I called around 5p.m.. She keep telling me that this is the location on Clybourn and I responded by saying OK may I place my order. So I proceeded to tell her I wanted a steak sandwich and my husband wanted a fish sandwich and she just suggested I go to the Armitage location. So I got the number from her and I called in my order at the Armitage location. �� ��So I intentionally sat in my car for fifteen minutes before I even parked and walked up the
The food is amazing. Its been awhile since I had middle eastern food this good. The wait staff is really friendly. I would recommended anything on the menu. I'm definitely going back.
"I was also with the same group as Adam after the Ovarian Cancer walk and I also found Nick's comment to be in very bad taste. ��While I'm giving the benefit of the doubt that Nick didn't actually mean to say something like that, he needs to think before he opens his mouth. �� I hope he doesn't get a table of people from the AIDS walk!!!"
"Very limited menu but everything was fabulous. No bread here. You get garlic popcorn instead. Very good but expensive wine list. Good for a special occasion but not every day dining. Fit for Foodies, Neighborhood Gem, Notable Wine List, Special Occasion, Hot Spot"
"This afternoon my buddy and I had a hankering for Mexican food so we headed to 18th Street. Found this place by accident and decided to try it. The line was a bit intimidating but it moved quickly and soon we were seated and had water, chips, two salsas, pickled carrots and chilis, and a pork-and-pepper tortilla roll-up thingy in front of us. The menu is a lot to look at but buddy chose chicken enchiladas with mole sauce and I had chicken burrito. Both were exceptional. Service was fast and friendly. We were full and satisfied. Restaurant was packed. All this for $21. Can't beat that! Things to know though... Metered street parking only and this place does not take credit cards. There is an ATM though--$2.50 charge."
It's definitely not authentic Mexican food..but since I don't live near Nuevo Leon..it's the next best thing! Price is decent and the drinks are delicious. My only complaint is the service...it's sometimes great then way too many times bad. But it's in my neighborhood so I can deal with the not so great service since the drinks are good!
I went here two times so far and definetly will come back! Mushroom Rissoto and the grilled pineapple are my favorite part of Brazzaz! staff are amazingly friendly and even pose as I snap photos. Don't fill yourself on the salad bar even though I do!!!
"Had Gunthorp farm chicken with oregano & roasted garlic $19, beef pot roast with red wine glazed root vegetables $23. Food was very good but way overpriced for the small portion size. ��So dark that we had to use Iphones to read the menu, the acoustics were bad so the noise level was high for talking with friends and the bathroom was downstairs and very secluded at the far end of a long hallway. ��I seriously could not see what was on the plates when our main dishes arrived. ��So much great food in Chicago at restaurants with better atmosphere. ��Sadly, won't go for dinner again."
Food was amazing! Good drinks too!
Amazing food and service. Surprising flavor combinations. Interaction with the chefs. Great atmosphere.
"After a day of sight seeing we decided to follow the reviews we'd seen at eat at The Purple Pig. It was very busy for a Monday night- even for a table for 2. The hostess first tried to sit us across from each other in the middle of a packed table. After waiting 5 more minutes we were sat next to each other. Even sitting next to each other, it was tough to hold a conversation due to the volume- even being on the patio. The server was very helpful explaining how the menu worked and made great recommendations. Everything we tasted was fabulous and really filling. The two of us shared 3 items (not the recommended 3 items per person!)."
"The first time I went to Graham Elliot it was so delicious that I had to bring back my foodie friend when she visited. Unfortunately the second visit we got miso lobster and it was too salty, the foie groie lollipops were interesting but left a weird aftertaste and unfortunately the dessert was a seasame yuzu and prickly pear jam...I know weird and it tasted weird. So unfortunately until my next visit...it is a 3 star visit!"
"Can't say enough about this family favorite... ��Affordable prices, excellent food and a warm and welcoming staff. ��Great choice for any occasion."
"Don't believe the hype, which is all Superdawg is. There are much better dogs in Chicago."
"i ordered online a few times and TWICE the paper was left on the cheese on the grilled cheese sandwich. I understand accidents happen, and thats why I gave them another chance. But twice!? Thats unacceptable. I tried to call the restaurant directly and talk to a manager but I was left on hold for 5 minutes before I gave up and decided to write a review."
"This restaurant is packed with people who think it's great because they were told by someone else how good it is. ��I recommend avoiding this place because it is too crowded and honestly the service was pretty bad. ��There are too many good restaurants in this city with great people working there, but if you want a place with big crowds, decent food and shitty service check it out."
"My wife and I have lived in many places in the US and abroad. ?She, before I, got turned off years ago of Mexican food because of the Tex Mex influence that we seemed to find everywhere. ?Well, several years ago when I was watching Public TV in Oklahoma City I saw Rick on MEXICO - ONE PLATE AT A TIME. ?I started watching him every Saturday and found that his style of Mexican cuisine was very interesting to me. ?I introduced my wife to it and we both decided that we would like to give it a try if we had a chance.It has been many years, but we finally had a chance to visit XOCO in Chicago this weekend. ?All I can say is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!! ?My wife had the Pork Belly Vermicelli Meal-in-a-Bowl-Caldo and I had the Carnitas Meal-in-a-Bowl-Caldo. ?Absolutely BREATHTAKING. ?The staff was so h"
"ok anyone who is rating this above 2 stars is crazy the sushi was horrible not to mention we ordered ��a chef selection and it came out with the most bland boring things you could think of. also the ""chef"" put not all the way un frozen bad tuna on the plate as well. The place was what it was but anything above 2 stars is so over the top."
Food is ok service is slow and salad bar sucks .I would skip this place .
"Great Atmosphere. Even the mocktails (non-alcoholic) were great! Got a drink with Honey, Cinnamon, and Club Soda/Lemon it was great! Worth the wait. Definitely pass by."
"The food here is excellent and reasonably priced. We like to dine in but find the restaurant a bit cramped, if they would just remove a table or two, its not a huge place, it would make a big difference. We also order take out at least once a month. If you find yourself up in Edgewater and are a fan of sushi you should try this place."
"Feels like your back in under grad, waiting in line at 4:00am for Taco. ��Never eaten here sober, but I am sure it is still great."
"Better than Giordano's. Everything tasted real and home-made, not like it could have been a frozen pizza. The cheese sticks were divine. Great service. Long line, but worth it. We got the four-cheese deep dish and it was exactly what we were looking for in our first-ever Chicago deep-dish pizza. Will be back!!"
Best brunch spot in Chicago.
"I've now been to Mercat 4 times. Everytime the food has been excellent, however on the last couple of occasions the service has been pretty bad. This time there were 7 of us and the waiter didn't seem to care as his tip was secure. It was lucky we checked the bill as we were charged for 2 bottles of wine when we only consumed one!"
"I knew this little gem when it was just a breakfast place and now it is so much more. Their takeout last night was great, hot, fresh, and healthy. The veggie wrap was wonderful, so was the spicy bean soup. Will keep this place in mind for the rest of the cold winter nights."
Great vegetarian options for lunch and dinner. ��The black bean cakes are especially tasty. ��Reasonable prices. ��I will go back again for sure!
This place is really great if you're looking for a fun night out. The sushi is always fresh and you have to admit nothing beats byob. ��I would definitely recommend Coast if you're looking for a lively place for delicious sushi.
"Finally tried the Brazilian chicken..AMAZING!!!!!!I could eat the chicken every day, but then I would burn out on it, and would in up regretting that, and going to get some sandwhich and fries at a franchise..Yuk. ��My favorite sides are the Garlic Mash potatoes and the potato salad(a potato thing i guess)..My friend likes the corn and black beans..I get the 1/4 chicken most of the time for less than 5.50, and the half chicken ��meal/special when i haven't eaten all day for less than $7... �� I don't know of any pizza & chicken places in the city, but this little place just makes good food, has a nice bunch of girls and guys working there,, and takes care of my take out needs. Too bad they don't serve steak like the Brazilian steak places downtown(an idea????). Check em out!!!"
"The food was fairly decent but way too loud to have a conversation with the people you are with. I have an out of town guest that I took here for dinner and being that I am new to the Chicago area, this place is not too far from where I live. I may come back and try it again during a week night, perhaps it won't be as noisy!"
"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday, lovely place with great decor. Inviting and staff is extraordinary, this new restaurant knows how to please their customers. ��We were seated in the bar area, some people may be offended being sat here but it was a lively atmosphere with a live pianist. The food was delicious I started with the wedge salad which was great. My boyfriend had the French onion soup, some of the best Ive tasted. ��We both had steak for our main coarse great flavor and charred to perfection. The gnocchi side dish with crab was also delicious and wealth worth the price! Mastro's also gave me a delicious piece of chocolate cake with happy birthday and a candle and presented it elegantly without singing a nice surprise to end the night! One of the best steak houses Ive been "

"I eat at Chinatown eavery Saturday. ��i have tried just about every restauant til last week. ��Tried this place- here is why I will not retuen:1. ��We and a few select others as dinner went on were sent upstairs to a second level which only had three people eating and the staff upstairs kept asking why we were being sent there. ��The downstairs was NOT busy and I woder how they chose to send us upstairs. ��2. ��The Sweet and Sour Chicken was below average- mostly breading. ��Every place here has better Sweet and Sour.3. ��Had to move because of the sun, yet they pasted paper over the windows a while later.4. ��Very dirty on the outside and very slow service.5. ��This place is WAY OVERATED!!!!!! ��Better plce just downstairs."
Loved this place. Always friendly service with great food.Went to meet friends for the all you can eat crab night. Doctors appt. went long and I arrived late. I was told I would not be allowed to order anything because of their strict reservation policy. With anything I said all they would say is we can't. Not to play the pity card but as someone who has been in the service industry for 20 years if I was talking to someone in a cast boot with IV tubes coming out of their arm ?with an obvious pump hooked up to them I might let them order a salad.There is a big difference between we can't and we won't
overpriced and not as tasty as it could be! ��for the kind of dollars required to eat here...needs improvement!
"I always love walking into a place where English isn't the only language being spoken. On this particular evening, there was live gypsy/jazz music - really great ambience. The Red Sangria was delicious, like I've never had before with spices and vanilla. Salmon and potato latke tapas with capers was flavorful. The tripe soup was savory, lemony, and melt-in-your-mouth. The servings were elegant and tasteful. I think the one thing that stood out most about all the food was the attention to texture in addition to flavor. There was an aura of authenticity, but also freshness. At the end of the night, the owner played a trick on us with a tube and some amazing brandy - hey, most people aren't just handing out alcohol these days and it made us feel like regulars even though it was our first time"
"reading all these good reviews makes me wonder..if i just went on a wrong day there!went there with my gf using a groupon, thanks GOD i had a groupon because if i had paid full price for this meal, i would shoot my self.I'm an appetizer freak, so had to try them all.the mussels were the most horrible i ever eaten in my life! go down to the Orbit Room and compare them to these garbage. you'll see what i mean.An other appetizer i ordered, don't recall the name, ?it was explained to me to be like a mashed potato with sour cream and Feta Cheece. What i received was a bowl of GRITS!!!!! yeah grits with a lil sour cream and some type of Cheece.... definitely NOT feta. I'm Greek damn it and i know my cheeses.. and most impotanly i know my foods... this placed sucked!the waitresses in the other ha"
"Excellent Sushi and wonderful service to match. ��The ""Sumo Roll"" - yummy! ��Don't miss the dessert."
I love this place because ypur seated immediately.The steak are delicious.
"I LOVE Fogo 2 Go! ��I live right across the street and this is where we always order our pizza--never think about any other place.You can either walk in and order a HUGE pre-made slice, or you can order one of their 60 different options. ��The 6-cheese is DIVINE! ��Also, they'll pretty much make anything you want. ��You can swap in the toppings that you prefer...and they're always more than happy to do it.Go! ��You will not regret it."
"A great restaurant. ��It's on the pricey side, but we always leave full and quite happy with our meal. ��The shrimp appetizer is quite good. ��This place is always full (but we've never had to wait but 5 minutes) and has a great atmosphere."
"Great addition -- a place that sits on the line between Edgewater and Loyola Park (err...Rogers Park). Awesome beer offerings and decent wine list. The best food options are the simpler (American) dishes. For example, don't get the Duck Confit instead go for the Roasted Chicken. It's a really pleasant place. Live music. Friendly bartenders and hostesses. In short, it's definitely worth a visit."
"This is JUST an ordinary bakery. A little bit overpricey for what they are doing. I have recently ordered a cake. Well, was very.... disappointed. Instead of exciting funny chemistry cake I saw a childish silly decorated round piece of ""art"" with all ugly colors on it that you can imagine in the world. To much frosting =(( yeaaak! , dry and NOT CHOCOLATE AT ALL! I will never order something from this place again and will not recommend it to anyone. Avoid at any cost! Try to experience something else and save money, time and nerves! :(("
"DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR!!! ��It's a wonderful place with a wonderful atmosphere, but when we went we sat at the bar and spent the entire time wishing we hadn't! Two brain dead bar-backs kept trying to figure out what they should be doing....(male and female) while the pseudo long-haired, short male bartender AND the big breasted female bartender completely ignored the bar patrons while they swigged wined.....got loaded and wasted our time. It was awful! When we FINALLY did get our food order it was great! The wine is great! But the idiots behind the bar ruined our visit. We plan to return.....sit at a table and allow the capable waitstaff to make our visit less annoying."
"i love white chocolate mocha at starbucks, i wish the price was reasonable, but when I love something I indulge. ��The stuff is friendly and its my favorite hang out place."
Great food !!!! lots of flavors generous portions !!! great experience the service can improve a bit overall great experience will definitely come back !!!
"This is my favorite bar in the entire world. ��Sure, the Speakeasy theme is becoming somewhat mainstream and played out, but the Violet Hour delivers in every way.After entering through a non-descript door covered in graffiti you enter a dark, bar only lit by candlelight. ��The decor is very well put tother and the bar itself is beautiful. ��If my memory serves me correctly, it was a white marble, which was gorgoes, and lined with large comfortable seats. ��On the other side, a knowledgeable bartender with plenty of spirits to satisfy the most picky drinker.Usually, I sit at the bar and the staff has been exceptional. ��Order a drink from their list, or just tell the barman what flavors you are looking for and they will put together a well crafted cocktail that seems to not exist and most bars."
"At the recommendation of a friend I visited Gino's, on a Tuesday night. We had to wait to have someone seat us, we had to ask a busboy to send a wait-person. Once he did come over he had absolutely no personality at all. We ordered drinks and waited for those, then ordered a deep dish pizza. After waiting an hour, with no contact from the waiter, the pizza arrived. The crust was overcooked and crumbly, no taste whatsoever. The toppings were good. The waiter came by and we asked for refills on the drinks then proceeded to watch the guy stand around for 15 minutes before ""remembering"" to get them. ��We watched countless other guests leave unhappy, many without waiting for their food to arrive. Unfortunately no one asked how the meal was, but I hope the 10 cent tip I left wasn't too much?! ��I "
"This restaurant is very good ! ��Definitely the best Italian restaurant in Chicago! We a had fresh imported burrata set on a finely sliced bed of culatello ��drizzled with a sublime quality of Olive oil.The main entree were fantastic. ��Risotto with asparagus, so creamy and ��tasty and home made gnocchi with fresh mushrooms just as creamy and earthy. ��We ended up sharing a wonderful order of grilled branzino fish with broccoli rabe on the side. ��The espresso coffee served with authentic home made cookies was amazing. I highly recommend it."
Love their pastries
This is my go to place in wrigleyville area for Vegan food. ��I have yet to have something here that I didn't like. ��The radical reuben is my favorite along with their shakes which are soooo good. ��Everyone here is so nice and polite the only thing i'm sad about is the place is pretty small and have had a handful of times been stuck waiting 45 minutes or longer. ��Not worth that wait but if i can get in in under 30 minutes I'll do it every time
"based on the reviews, you'd think this is the best place on the planet. ��It's a nice quick fix if you're hungry, but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to come here. ��I've been to two of the Pasadita's, had the steak tacos both times. ��They were good, but not as good as expected."
"I don't generally crave specific foods, but this is a HUGE exception. ��I've tried almost everything on the menu but I usually get the falafel--extra spicy--and maybe some of their baked cheese and egg bread. Maaaybe some lentil soup. ��Everything is amazing. If I have people in town visiting I make sure to bring them here..it has never disappointed!"
"I must say I was highly disappointed by this restaurant. ��After looking at the menu, I expectd a lot from my first experience there. ��The atmosphere, however, was not conducive for a pleasant dining atmosphere. ��It was extremely dark, so dark in fact that I could barely see the steps on the stairs and had to use my cell phone to read the menu. ��Furthermore, the place was noisy as heck like the New York Stock Exchange with less intelligent people. ��The woman was laughing hysterically and stomping on the floor at some lame joke. ��I attribute that perhaps to her drunkeness? ��Let's hope.The food was also disappointing. ��It was more vietnamese than French and I've eaten better food at a noodle shop in Chinatown. ��Everything was mediocre. ��My entre, the salmon with vermicelli was filled with too"
"I checked this place out after reading about it in the Red Eye (best burger or something) -- what a dump! ��Food was totally average and the place smelled like stale beer. ��There's no vibe to the space and the staff was, like, whatever!Don't bother!"
Pros:Booze Cart - bonus points for the Ice WineSalad Bar - nice assortment and quality ingredientsCons:OverpricedYou will wish you were at Texas di Brazil instead
Good Food and Good Pricing. Desert options are great with the Just a Bite options.
"Outstanding food and service, great for date night with the wife."
I go here with friends quite often. Try to get a table on the patio. Its a great place for sharing. Last time we did only appetizers and the selection was amazing. Try the grilled octopus and the panna cotta is the best.
"I drove past this restaurant on a Saturday, and decided to go back with some people for dinner that same night. ��I had a great time. ��We had drinks, and appetizers.. the polenta is awesome. ��Then we ordered dinner, steak and goulash. ��The goulash is the BEST! ��I can't wait to come back. ��The owner stoped at our table, and even picked me and my girlfriend up out of our chairs to dance to the band that was playing. ��If you don't like dancing, you can watch the rest dance which proved to be quite entertaining. ��Try it out! ��I can't wait to go back."
"Dear Jesus! ��The braised beef and plantain appetizer (Ropa Vieja) was quite possibly the best flavor combination I have ever experienced. ��The beef was cooked perfectly, the plantains were great, and the cheese and onions complemented everything perfectly. ��Also, the different textures - soft beef, crisp and creamy plantains, and fresh onions - worked together absolutely perfectly. ��Another notable was the side of mushrooms with bacon and leeks. ��It probably was minimally a thousand calories per bite, but well worth it. ��Delicious!The rest of the meal and their fresh fruit-mojitos were great too. ��The only complaint I had was that their soup of the day would have been better suited to winter than summer. ��It was too heavy for summer - had sausage, garbanzo beans, other big chunks of veggie"
"The Mill is a required stop when in Chicago. ��And if you live here, all the better. ��Every night has a different vibe, so if you don't like the swing stuff on Thursdays, try Kimberly Gordon on Sundays (come early for the Poetry Slam). ��You just have to go."
"I went to Carnivale for the first time a few months ago with my boyfriend. First off, I love the place. I love the area, the decor its so pretty and colorful. Its pretty upscale, and a place to go on a special ocassion. I know Carnivale is Latin American style food, but being mexican, the food was an...interesting..take on the style of food most Latins I know eat. Not saying it was horrible, it was actually pretty good. But definetly a yuppie place."
"The food here was delicious! ��Very flavorful. We've been twice now and the service was fine. ��Not overbearing but not intrusive either. ��Very friendly wait staff who are happy to make suggestions if you don't know what to order. ��We tried the combination plate and ordered two veggie and two meat dishes. ��All were full of flavor and the spicy dishes had some heat but nothing approaching burning or painful. ��The prices are really reasonable for the quality of food. ��The portions were good- not so tiny you feel cheated but not so huge you can't finish. ��Just right in my opinion. ��With two glasses of wine plus the combo plate, for a dinner of two the bill came to just $25!The crowd was a good mix, which suits Uptown perfectly in my opinion. ��There was a family with a child, several small group"
"First time trying Sushi X...The place was packed, had to wait 30 minutes for a seat, weird artwork on the walls, no alcohol...all of which didn't matter when I tried my first bite of a roll - the double stack.Loved it. And the red dragon. And the carpaccio. And the ceviche.Yes, the place is small, parking is tough (ride a bike!), service was not exceptional (but the waitresses were busy, I can understand that), yes, the artwork on the walls were a bit of a shock but now having eaten there, I can sense that's part of the restaurant's personality.Bottom line: the food was delicious, and within budget for me."
First Impression: Dark and hip. ��Great place for up to 4 people to have cocktails. ��The high back chairs great a conversation nook. ��We had tried to come here during a previous visit to Chicago but the wait ended up being about 3.5 hours. ��We decided to come early (7ish) and this time we were successful.Drinks:Where to begin. ��I had the Blinker which was a perfect summer drink. ��Refreshing without being too sweet. ��It was so good I had it twice. ��In between this lovely cocktail I had the the Violet Hour Old Fashioned which was also great with its single large ice ball. ��My husband has a Sazerac for the first time and LOVE it. Next he had a Manhattan with chocolate bitters- the best one he ever had. He finished the evening with a gimblet. ��This was a lot of drinks.Food:We did not order food
It's better than Tecalitlan!
"Food poisoning. On my 30th birthday.I chose Sapori based on Yelp reviews for my birthday dinner. And yes, the food was good. The service was good, the servings were huge, and we had tons left over to take home. The butternut squash ravioli? Delicious. And that was not the culprit. These factors take my rating from one star to three.The problem was with the leftovers. Maybe the dressing on the salad interacted with the aluminum take-home container; maybe someone use a contaminated utensil when transferring the food to the container. I live near the restaurant, and the food went straight into the fridge when we got back--and none of it contained meat--so it wasn't my fault. The cannoli and salad were all I ate the next night, and before I finished the cannoli I started to feel sick, and I wa"
"Came across a show on Food Channel yesterday talking about this place so decided to give it a try. ��I love spicy food so went with the suicide wings. ��Sauce was definitely on par on my heat index but the chicken was average at best. ��It was a bit over cooked making it drier than it should. ��When that happens, most of the juice from the chicken is gone and can't blend with that amazing sauce. ��Kinda like eating chicken jerky drowned with hot sauce. ��But looks like they have other interesting items on their menu. ��Will definitely give them another try next time to see if they deserve an improved rating"
"Absolutely love Gino's. Been there multiple times and I honestly feel that Chicago style pizza does not get better than this. Any place that serves an entire layer of sausage (like a manhole cover) in a pizza will get a 5 star rating from me! I also feel that Gino's is the best crust of the top Chicago pizza places. The reason I think this is because it is ""buttery."" I feel like many Chicago pizza crusts are dry but this one is not! The atmosphere is awesome and you are right off of Michigan Ave. The only thing is that one time I had pizza at the bar to watch a Sox game and the bartender was annoying. I think he was trying to seem like a cool Chicago yuppy but I think his services would be more appreciated at an Applebee's in Rockford, IL as opposed to downtown Chicago."
"Great first time experience with Ethiopian food! Minus 1 star because I could have used more direction from the waitress but honestly, we loved 5 of the 6 choices. It's fun to eat with your hands too! DO NOT leave without trying the sambussas- we had the variety and each flavor was better than the last. I want to go back for those right now thinking about them!"
This is my all time favorite restaurant. I love fondue and the quality is amazing. WAY better than a melting pot. It is on the pricey side as fondue usually is. Full dinners are anywhere from $35-50 per person. But you def get your $'s worth. So much food! I cant say enough about this restaurant. 2 of my fav bonus's??? NO KIDS! and Valet :)
Their butter-injected steaks are out of this world. ��Not too expensive for a steakhouse. ��The staff is very friendly and attentive. ��I would definetely come back again.:)
"Simply great pizza, lots of variety, and the bst chicken(grilled too) that I have ever eaten in my life!!! Place is small, normally do take out, but sometimes I stop and eat-in and watch a game there. This is one of those family businesses that ill be talking about to ""my kids"" when I'm older. Awesome..Awesome.."
"lechon sandwich is my fave!!!!!!!!! great flavors,the bread is delicious! most deff hooked on this sandwich! lol"
We ducked into the Coast from the cold the other day with four adults and three small kids and took over the large booth in the corner upstairs. We were trying to keep the little ones under control but they were jacked up and having a blast running around and climbing. The staff was extremely friendly and unflappable amidst all of the chaos we were creating. And the food was great! The grilled calamari salad was especially fresh and delicious. The kids actually sat still once they were eating. We thanked the waiter for being so tolerant of our group and even the owner came over to say she loves it when families come in. We will definitely be coming back!!
"I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND GOING ��HERE. I ordered a 9$ bottle of saki, waiter returned with a 22 dollar bottle saying they were 'sold out' Bit the bullet, bought the 22 dollar bottle and not but halfway into the drink i pour this out... ��goo.gl/n4imX A FLY in my sake bottle. Needless to say i was not pleased and i requested the bottle be taken off the bill. The owner refused and then called the police, who came and explained that there was a 'legal limit' to how unsanitary a place can be. A restaurant that serves raw fish with those sorts of insects=gross. The police forced the owner to give me another bottle for free (exactly what i wanted :/ ) Id say the service is shitty here and the sanitation is even worse."
"Such a great restaurant in the neighborhood, nothing can beat it, WOOOOW!!! Wonderful pick for families as well as dates looking for a lovely experience. I went on a monday evening with my friend, we were really excited, it has a nice ambiance and decor. We got grilled chicken salad, fried chicken and parmesan fish with rice, nothing went wrong in that, fresh, hot and cooked for perfection,, so scrumptious."
"this place is fantastic. ��great food, always have good service, and long to get back every time i leave the place. �� i have several out-of-town friends who demand we go here every time they visit.,......and it never disappoints.!highly recommended!"
"Still so full as I type this from dinner tonight. ?This was my second time at Geja's. The food is just oh so yummy! ?I really think I'll go in next time and just start with the chocolate fondue because it is definitely my fave! ? The first time I went to Geja's, I wasn't too happy with the service. While the hostess was going to seat us, a waitress went up to her and said don't seat them in my section. I don't want another table. Ive been a waitress so I get having bad nights, but really? Right in front of me? Someone must have called her out after because she came to apologize but the damage was done. ?Good thing we didn't get sat with her. ?Our server, who was awesome, got a really good tip! Only reason Geja's is missing one star is for that rude server.Today was no problem. Typically, y"
"Mmm, I had the white chocolate pretzel pancakes - I can still taste them in my mind. My friend got the chorizo burrito, it was average. It's a great place for brunch, good atmosphere, lots of typical white people who go to brunch. Prices were typical for Wicker Park, but I keep thinking about the syrup of white chocolate - addicting!"
"Food is great but service is worthless. Miss match, need to hire professional waitstaff and not college kids"
"What a great place! Both for the wonderful food, and the great setting. The outdoor patio is just charming and relaxing. The simplest of dishes like a Caprese salad, go beyond expectation from ingredients at their peak of flavor. The pasta was memorable, the Duck the best I have ever had, done to perfection, the meat moist and flavorful, the skin crisp. ��Truly a great place for great food."
"Upon entering Sunda I thought perhaps it was too large a room to have any kind of ""intimate"" dining experience. ��But, the attentiveness of our waiter and the staff helped get me past that first impression. ��The menu is fabulous with so many choices that I will have to go back to experience more. ��My guest and I were both quite pleased with our choices. ��And, we were well taken care of throughout the duration of our visit...which was lengthy considering we had a lot to catch up on. ��We were made to feel welcome to stay and enjoy the experience. ��I thought it was a bit pricey, but was not disappointed in any way."
"WOW. the food is SO amazing here. Yes the portions are small but packed with flavor. I actually went there for Chicago Restaurant Week (because the pricing on it was much more affordable), and had a variety of items with my friend. The food not only pleased my palate, but my eyes as well! If you are willing to spend a little bit of $$$ for a decent and satisfying (not full) meal, then this place is place to try"
"I am basing this review on the one lunch that I have eaten at Cafe 28. ��I had the steak sandwich, though I think it had a cooler name on the menu. ��It was on point! ��The meat was cooked properly, the seasoning was excellent and the bread was the right blend of moist on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside. ��The chips on the side were, I think, fried plantains. ��They where a great change to the normal fries or potato chips. ��My lunch mate ordered a sandwich as well (forget what one) but it looked better than mine.I highly recommend this restaurant for lunch and am excited to try it for dinner."
"O V E R R A T E D but good! I really wanted to belive in this place. No exxageration but almost everyone I know says this is the best. I have to disagree, and so does my husband, mother in law and my son. We came here on a Tuesday night (raining and freezing) and it was crowded. We were seated fast which was a huge plus. I ordered the carne asada dinner with one enchilada. I WAS NOT A FAN AT ALL of the enchilada. It was made with american cheese EW, I only know this because I asked. I took one bite and BLAH! The carne asada was fantastic to say the least, tender, juicy, flavorful and flat out great. (Best part of my meal)Frijoles were a big pro as well. I couldnt stop eating them.Guacamole -EH (could be better) Warm Horchata? huh? ��yes. warm.Arroz (rice) was ok, it seemed instant actually."
I moved into the neighborhood recently and had been wanting to try this place. Now I dont know what took me so long!No surprise I ordered the turkey club. I am just a creature of habit. This was different though- on a grilled fresh italian baguette and the kicker was the piece of dill havarti. ��YUM. My mom had a veggie sandwich that was equally delicious. ��My brother ordered the bean soup and a piece of apple pie ��a la mode (he is so weird) We all left stuffed and very pleased with the meal and the service. I will definitely be back to try the breakfast as well as carry out. Very relaxed atmosphere and everyone in there looked like happy locals. People either seemed to linger or be able to get in and out quickly. The 3 of us got out for under $40 since we didnt drink any booze.
"Great restaurant , great service the salad bar has a lot of selections and the meats are to die for great job !!"
"I'm torn about what to give Sunda. ��The restaurant and crowd are dazzling, the wait staff is friendly, the food is pretty. ��That said, the food is only decent. ��Everything I have had here is good, nothing is stellar, but the atmosphere and vibe are so hot, it's hard to resist!"
"Awesome food for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. ��BYOB hell ya. ��I like to grab a 40 oz or a 4 loko from m & w down the block and get completely wasted while i eat, then hit on the sexy boys who work there. ��Shout out to the host and the delivery boys! ��Y'ALL ARE SO HOTT!! Just go before 6:30 or after 9 if you wanna avoid the wait. Nice, sexy people. I love it!"
"I would've say I love Anteprima, but I also don't hate it either. Some of the positives about it are that is a cute, quaint, bistro style Italian place in the heart of Andersonville. It isn't decorated over the top, and you almost feel like you are at someone's home for dinner. It's very charming and cute. The service has, for the most part, always been spot on minus one woman I had almost a year ago who talked to me and my date for almost 45 minutes about her life problems. The outdoor seating on the patio is beautiful and coveted during the Summer months. As for the menu, I want to preface this by saying that I am very well versed in different food ingredients and styles. Yet, even I have a difficult time guiding through the menu at Anteprima. It's not that a unique ingredient is mixed i"
"This was a very disappointing experience. We ordered the tasting menu with pairings. When we left we were still somewhat hungry and were disappointed that there was only about 1/4 of a drink poured (at most) with each pairing. This wouldn't have been so bad if the food and drinks came out together. On most courses the drinks came out significantly before the food which wouldn't have been a problem if there was enough of the drink to take a few sips before the food came and then still have some left to taste with the food. There were a lot people working, but rarely did the same person bring anything to the table which may explain the poor timing. The table next to ours received 3 courses while we waited for our dessert to arrive. And consistent with the prior courses--the drinks were out f"
"I went there recently for the lunch buffet with a friend. ��We haven't had breakfast, spent the morning walking around in the snow, and was reasonably hungry. ��We were also looking for a good meal that will fill two healthy adult men, and came to India House.Soon as we sat down, we were served some garlic naan and tandoori chicken that was served on a sizzling platter. ��Which was gooood! ��The waiter asked if we would like some more, but we opted to try the buffet. ��From my memory I remember about 12 or more entree options, with stir fried veggies and at least two different rice dishes, one being plain white. ��I've been to maybe two different Indian lunch buffets in my life, but this is easily the best in terms of quality and quantity. ��They also have a good salad/fruits selection and some t"
best deep dish pizza!!!!
Definitely a good neighborhood restaurant. ��I live just a few blocks away and I can always count on it for a good burger or fish fry. ��Not very parking friendly area and does not have valet. ��Been here a couple of times and food is consistent and service fast and friendly. ��I would categorize it as a .. gastropub. ��Upscale bar with great food! ��Not really great for celebration dinners but great casual neighborhood restaurant with a kitchen with talent.
"Hands down the best deep dish pizza in Chicago. ��The buttery crust and cornmeal touch really give the crust an outstanding flavor. ��Also, there ingredients always seem to be fresh.They do not serve stuffed pizza, only chicago deep dish, so I'm not comparing it to places like edwardo's or giordano's that serve stuffed.No matter how many times I go, I end up eating about half of what I think I will eat, just because the pizza is so filling.The sausage is very tasty. ��You can either have crumbled sausage or an entire patty on your pizza. ��As for the pepperoni, I am not a big fan. ��Some places have a very greasy type pepperoni with a waxy taste and that's how I felt it tasted.Overall, though, I will keep coming back for the quality and taste of their pizza."
"Hopleaf, where people go to feel sophisticated by drinking overpriced fancy beers and act like they are above the light beer drinkers. I mean come on this bar does have good food, a solid layout and such but the clientele can be quite pompous about the beer. I was given a suggested beer and it tasted like raw hamburger. Hopleaf in one word.......OVERRATED."
Really really great food and service. Also much less expensive than other restaurants in the area. Very extensive menu.
"I love Calo, great big portion size, nice selection of food and good service for a cheap price. ��We take all our friends when they visit, and all have been thoroughly impressed. We like to go mid week as the salad and soups aren't as special as we'd like although they do come as a free extra! Definately worth a visit , especially for the Ribs!"
"Just a friendly warning to others...we experienced horrible service at the greektown location. ��We will not be back. ��We arrived at 9:30am on a Sunday and got a table right away. ��If you decide to try this place on a weekend, I would recommend going before 10am, because it did get busy at that time. ��We were rushed to order right when we sat down and the menu is quite extensive so we asked for a few minutes. ��Even though she came back twice in one minute, it wasn't that big of a deal and we ordered several things off the menu. ��The coffee smells a little burnt and tastes bitter--not my favorite--had to put a lot of cream in it. ��The juices we tried were smooth but not good flavor combinations. ��The donut pancakes were fine but doughy in the middle. ��The potatoes and eggs were fine. ��The se"
I used to work in this building before it was a bar. HUGE RENOVATION! tons of lcd tv's. Great concept of having recorded shows from all over the globe being played (when the hawks aren't in the playoffs that is).Menu is simple and well done. Burger guy/gals paradise. Gumball bear always seems to be on special which i cannot complain about. Definitely a lot better than all the other miller lite specials and bud light specials everywhere else. We went in there on a sat afternoon. wasnt packed and were able to sit right down at the bar. My gf and i got the mac and cheese to split and each got a burger. Outstanding!!!! we sat there eating and drinking for 3+ hours and only ended up spending $50. we were taken care of and even the owner came up and bought us a shot on the house. Not something t
"When I went to this place, it was great. Good memories here. Great place to know with someone you love. Great food. Romantic ambiance. I loved the enclosed booths. I would love to go again but it's just so far from where I reside now."
"I had the chance to visit this place about a month ago and I was very pleased with the atmosphere, the food, drinks, and the waitstaff. I would definitely frequent this place again in the near future. Great after work place to gather with co workers or friends---the appetizer's are nicely priced and delicious!"
"The interior is very warm. Kinda reminds me of a mansion. I would imagine that it would be more elegant come the holidays.As a college student, I wouldn't say it's a good place to go. But for going on dates, a plus. The bread is fresh and the portion size is very big, yet delicious. VERY DELICIOUS!! It was well worth paying the 16 dollars the entree cost. Me and my girlfriend had leftovers, and even then it was still good."
"Amazed that a restaurant in this economy would turn away 6 parties of 6 as a reservation on a Saturday afternoon. ��Literally, the worst business decision an owner can make. ��The Bad Apple lives up to its name...it is disgraceful. ��We are happy to take our business elsewhere. ��It won't be long before The Bad Apple closes its door as I will be sure to tell everyone in the neighborhood to boycott the restaurant. ��#Appalled"
"This place needs to take an etiquette class to learn how to talk to customers on the phone. I no longer have the stomach for pizza after talking to their rude employees. Normally the pizza is good enough to make up for it, but not this time."
"Went for the breakfast special which i think is served before 10am was only 6.50. ��Awesome food and really friendly service. Awesome empanada, best churro I've ever had and all for $6! ��The wait in the morning is also only around 10 minutes."
"Had dinner with an out-of-town friend here late on a Friday night (in truth, because I had forgotten to make reservations more than a couple days in advance and couldn't get in to some of the hotter places - he wanted a foodie experience).The prix fixe menu is great - $60 for 3 course, plus intervening mini courses. I must immediately add that the cheese course that was comprised of a grilled cheese sandwich with those lacy cheese crackers on the outside was much much too heavy to be served between the main course and dessert. We were both a little disgusted and overwhelmed. The beer pairing served with it was nice, but a little out of place, just like the whole cheese thing. I mean, grilled cheese is just really heavy.But back on track...we had a great meal, the service was excellent, ver"
"Extensive beer list, ranging from the cheap to the not cheap. The food menu is refreshingly unique, with such items CB & J (Cashew butter and fig jam) sandwich (a favorite of my friends) to Organic Brisket ( a little red for my taste) but as a student, it's not a place I could frequent due to it being a little pricey. The atmosphere is crowded and buzzing with conversation, but not difficult to hear. Very popular ( we had to wait an hour on a Thursday), but once you're seated, the staff is friendly and the beer and food comes quickly. A great place if you are looking for the Belgian beer experience combined with an organic menu in a comfortably animated atmosphere."
"Two of my friends and I stopped in on a night when the restaurant was noticeably busy, but were still able to get a table right away even without a reservation. ��Our waitress was super friendly and very knowledgeable. ��Our food was OUTSTANDING, from appetizers to entrees to desserts ��The owner even stopped over himself (on a busy night, no less) to offer his recommendations on the menu, and offered to personally pair wine choices for our entrees. ��We eat out a lot and this was one of the best dining experiences we have had to date, and we will definitely be going back to the gage again!!!"
"Was in on saturday night after a friend suggested this place and was pleasantly surprised. ��Vintage, reclaimed & salvaged decor, great drinks, music and chill late night crowd. Nice retro feel and casual service!"
"Plenty of food for the price. ��Steak was a bit over cooked, but not outside acceptable. ��Excellent bar service."
Horrible service. That by itself is a reason to never return.
"Went in a small group and we thoroughly enjoyed our mixed drinks, bottles of wine and the sushi. ��Everything was presented nicely and our server was very attentive. ��It was a little loud but only because every table in the restaurant was taken. I think noise is to be expected. ��Our wines were quite delicious. We had a Riesling and a Sauv Blanc. ��The cocktail menu was unique and my drink tasted quite lovely. ��My group seemed very pleased with the sushi and apps. The side of cauliflower was incredibly tasty and I recommend it for vegetarians."
Great place! My favorite breakfast spot! The Staff is always friendly & nice! LOVEEE their Banana Blue Crunch Cakes.... Yummm so good!!Their egg white skillets are also delish!! ��Always get the same thing every time I go... Someday I will venture out & try more delish stuff! ;) go early or you will probably wait... But def worth the wait!!!
"I've had Fogo 2 Go twice, and it is absolutely phenomenal!the service is wonderful, and I can tell that all of the staff truly want to make you feel at home. but let's get to the food.oh, their wonderful, wonderful food!My favorite pizza is the Margherita pizza, which is oh-so-fresh, even after delivery!the prices are practically unbeatable for food of this quality.the only bad thing i would say is that once, they forgot to deliver our sides, and my dad called, and they were SUPER nice and apologetic about it. It was just once, and it can happen to anybody- not something to bump it down a star for!never been to the actual restaurant, but based on pictures and other reviews, the atmosphere seems lovely. RECOMMEND!"
"For some reason I can't get enough of this place. While the food is good, the aesthetic is better. DEFINITELY sit upstairs-- you're missing out if you don't. Downstairs is certainly pretty, but a bit formal, and upstairs offers a a small patio and an incredibly comfortable lounge area. The only thing to be wary of is that due to the size and relative intimacy of the place, one obnoxious person can (and likely will) ruin the evening for anyone trying to have good conversation in the restaurant...."
This is a favorite date spot of my girlfriend and me. ��We like to go there and really like that we can bring our own bottle of wine. ��Most often when we go out the cost of the liquor exceeds the cost of the food but this place allows you to save a little bit of money and have a GREAT meal. ��We've been here more than 5 times and have always been fairly impressed. ��Our most recent trip though (this past Friday) was a step above the rest. ��I've had a few different servers there but this was the first time with Christine. ��She was right on the ball and helped me and my date have a really enjoyable dinner. ��We are creatures of habit and often just sit down and order the same stuff each time. ��However Christine insisted that we get a different special wasabi which turned out to be so much more n
"The Chicago Diner is the quintessential vegetarian/vegan restaurant! Hands down. ��My favorite thing to order is the Ruben, and I order it almost everytime I go there. ��They seem to have a good range of dishes there, including soups, and mashed potatoes with gravy. ��In the summer they have a nice outdoor eating area which I love. ��The staff is always pleasant and upbeat, despite them being busy. ��I would reccomend this to anyone, even if they are not a vegetarian. ��Just good stuff!!"
"Usually my husband and I will get carry out salt chicken and BBQ pork from the front counter for the past two years. Two days ago we decided to eat in with two friends. We got the multi-course Peking duck special (daikon radish appetizer, Peking duck, duck soup, fried rice and mango/raspberry sorbets), a plate of garlic water spinach, and two fried soft shell crabs. The food was excellent and there was enough food for some leftovers."
"Not @ all what I expected with the Pizza, Way too East coast for me, But hey, The beer was awesome here, Great selection with many being made on the premises, I'll 4 star the Beer but 2.5 star the Pizza, When I want great Chicago style Pizza I go to La Gondola on Ashland or Lou Malnati's on Damen & North Ave."
"Sign me up for some more of those core fusion classes at Exhale because I stuffed my face last night with the biggest red velvet cake ever. And I enjoyed every minute of it! I probably should have stopped at the cupcake, but nope. Decided to have some of those coffee flavored tarts as well. Believe me- they were well worth the calories."
"Great place to stop by any time of year for delicious food & beer pairings. It is a great place to take in a drink & read the paper/magazine/book or go with friends or your current main squeeze. The portions are generous, the staff is friendly & knowledgeable, the location is great & the patio is lovely when it is open."
"What a great experience, time and again.My first time was at the recommendation of a friend for brunch. We ended up brunching for 2 hours with 11 friends, some coming while others were going - and the service was friendly, warm and always welcoming through it all. ��The food not only exceeded my expectations as a Southern boy with lots of New Orleans time under my belt, it blew them away.The crabcake benedict was flawless, and every other meal at the table was equally as perfect. ��Needless to say, it was my first choice for a birthday dinner a few nights ago, and has quickly become my most recommended and talked about hangout.Kudos for creating such a warm, inviting, friendly and professional spot among the many, many attitude and dismissive establishments in North Chicago."
My first experience in Rick Bayless restaurant was amazing! The food is delicious and also affordable! The second time I went there he was actually out of the kitchen and a lady asked him to take a picture with her. His body guard was next to him but he agreed and made the customer happy! He is a great chef. I love this restaurant!
"I have eaten at L&E several times, and I have been blown away each time. The desserts are to die for, the library of whiskeys is incredible, the service is helpful, evenly paced, informative and professional ... the ambiance is enjoyable, though it can get loud late at night. I love that the menu is frequently updated, and they impress time and time again. You're missing out if you haven't been!!"
"I haven't had much persian food but this place was pretty good.It's a little pricey for the location, environment, presentation. The tadig was pretty good, but a little on the buttery side. It's basically just crispy rice with sauce poured over. Everyone raved about the hummus but I didn't find it all that special. It was good but nothing special. I got the walnut-pomegranate sauce chicken and the sauce was surprisingly pretty good. Even though it was sweet, it was also a bit savory, with a creamy texture."
"The pickles they start you out with are awesome.Went for restaurant week....Had the grilled shrimp app...Shrimp were great, and the dipping butter was good as well. ��The grilled polenta served with it was nothing special...soft polenta/grits would be a be a better accompaniment. ��Also had the meat sampler....Meat was good, but not the best ever, pulled chicken, pork, and kobe brisket. ��The BBQ sauces they have on the side were pretty disappointing. ��The vinegar based one was decent, the other 2 thicker ones were way too sweet, and I think the 'spicy' one was just the regular thick one with some red chili flakes added. meh.Had the Kobe Beef brisket entree. ��I have never had Kobe beef, but from what I know about it, I figured this would be a real treat. ��Again, not that it was not good, but "
"yea, it's already been said by everyone else, but this place is dope. long lines on weekend night to eat, but they got a lotta good whiskey to choose from to make that time fly by. the food here is amazing, they got tons of good beers to pair with your meals, and the servers/bartenders are great. go here. confirm the hype. repeat."
"Didn't have the chicken like most folks who come here, instead I had the Baby Buddha Bi Bim Bop ..... it was alright, nothing special. One comment I have is the egg that is one top of the rice had it's egg white edges cut off. Strange. Why do that and where do the edges go? Just leave the egg alone, please!Next time I'll try the fried chicken."
"I have always enjoyed the food here. �� However, a couple of weeks ago I took some friends that were visiting from out of town to this location and had an awful experience. ��The waitress came to our table a total of 2 times throughout the meal, once to give us our bill (on which we were charged 75 cents for the lemons we had requested for our water). ��After going through some difficulty in locating someone to make payment to due to our waitresses' neglect, I was talked back to by our waitress who continuously rolled her eyes at me as well. ��In addition, she charged our credit cards the wrong amounts and the manager told me he ""had 6 things going on and no time to hear what I had to say"". ��I have never been treated so poorly at ANY dining establishment. ��I have emailed the establishment with"
Authentic simple Italian food.There is nothing bland about Piccolo Sogno.....remember this is an authentic Italian restaurant not an Italian-American restaurant.
"I had a recent business trip to Chicago and was recommended to dine at Kinzie Chop House. Being the only person I sat at the bar with a very friendly bartender Nicole who's was very charming. I asked for recommendations and she pointed right at the steaks! I had the Filet with the broccoli cheese fondue and it was awesome! Nicole and some staff that I saw seemed very outgoing as well as friendly, I felt very welcome. I would differently recommend Kinzie for the food and Nicole for the charming. Great Place!"
"Awesome beer bar located right down the street from my house. This is a great place to drink the night away, eat, or meet friends. It gets 4 stars because sometimes its god awful to squeeze in here when its packed to capacity."
"It was my second time in Wishbone and it gets better every time. Food is pretty good (I'm talking about breakfast) and the menu is extensive . Prices are very reasonable, service was fast and I absolutely love their fresh carrot juice. I'll definitely be back!"
"I live in Andersonville, and often walk to the restaurants and pubs nearby. ��My wife and I hit this place at least 3 times a month at various times. The food is reasonably priced, delicious and healthy. ��Yes, the service can be a bit slow, but for those of you who've visited Europe or Northern Africa, cafes are SUPPOSED to leave you alone to enjoy your conversation and food. If you're a typical rushed American who needs to get in and out (as I've been on a number of lunches), simply flag down a server--no big deal. The owner is also quite a character, and fun to talk to. ��I think he's French Algerian. ��Final note: I brought my entire family in once (about 12 people) with individuals from out of town. They loved the place. ��Bottom line: Great food, good prices and friendly staff."
"I went to Nana twice be4, and I enjoyed my breakfast over there. Regular American style breakfast with tea or coffee serving.Price: a little expensive in the areaIt's a place good to go once a week."
The place is great- esp the food~ it has to be one of the best places to get cakes and baked yummiesThe stuff on the menu is great as well~A good starter is the pommes frites~ great great friesOne thing I want to warn about is the service. ��Takes a while to order or ask for things...
Nana's is honestly one of the best Organic restaurants in Chicago. Nana is a super sweet lady and makes you feel welcomed! the food is great and the art on the walls is awesome! recommend this to anyone in the bridgeoprt area!
"My greatly anticipated brunch visit to Yolk was not ""yolktastic"" or as ""yolkalicious"" as I would have liked. It was brunch so at the very least it was fine (like drinking a shitty beer...it's still beer right?). The place is nice and I could eavesdrop on other people's conversations since all my brunch parter could talk about was her hatred for honey melon.But beware...you can valet your car at the garage next door but there are men there in uniform, running around the garage, but I don't think they know they work there. I had to validate my own parking, get my own keys and get my car myself. Since I was the only person working in the garage that day I didn't pay. Plus, being drunk from the night before made the whole experience a little bit confusing."
"BYOB!I love Sultans. My husband and I are both vegans and this is a staple in our diet. Their food and drinks are a little on the pricy side so if you can I'd recommend bringing a drink if your a cheapskate like me!Try the aloe drinks, they are amazing!100% vegan unless otherwise noted, this is just the place for a sweet vegan date ;-)"
"Have been twice now and both times had a great experience. ��Fun place to go with friends to share different items; ��the giant focaccia is fantastic. ��Both times service was good, with helpful wine and entree suggestons made, which I appreciate."
I have been here a few times before and I keep coming back!!! That's all I have to say. ��I have never had a bad experience here..
"Boy do I love pizza, especially from Lou Malnattis and THIS LOCATION for Ginos East. ��Don't even bother eating at any other Ginos locations, I don't know why, but it sucks."
It doesn't remind you so much of an Italian restaurant as much as an actual restaurant in Italy. One of those small tratorias where you walk in and the chairs don't quite match and the interior is a little rustic but the food is incredible and in season. They are extremely creative and the menu changes frequently for new foodie adventures while they also keep the crowd favorites on the menu. Try the lemon panna cotta.
"Classic!Everything a great jazz club should be. ��Dark, Crowded, eclectic mix of people. ��Martinis stirred, not shaken and served in the old fashioned glasses. Not to mention the music. ��You can catch some of today's best jazz performers up close & personal.Few places like this exist in the world..."
"I was quite impressed with the ambiance, service and salad bar at Brazzaz. The food was good, the lamb, shrimp and pineapple outstanding. ��My only complaint is that they paid no attention to how your coin was flipped (either black for no, thanks, and orange for YES, GIVE ME SOME!). ��This tended to interrupt the enjoyment of the food as you were constantly making choices in mid-chew! ��If you choose to go, make sure you are HUNGRY and don't fill up too much on the salad bar (they had salmon and capers the night I went, yummy!)"
This place has a good environmentOk customer serviceGreat crab RangoonsDecent food
"I recently arranged a group dinner while visiting Chicago and wanted good Italian away from the hotel/Loop. ��I came across Sapori Trattoria (thanks Yelp) and had a WONDERFUL experience from start to finish! ��GROUP ARRANGEMENTS -- Anthony, the chef and owner, was very accommodating in pulling together a dininig package that was affordable and flexible enough for diners to make individual selections. ��He even arranged to process individual checks, which a welcome surprise for a 20+ group. ��Thanks to list of nearby attractions and shopping that Anthony provided, diners were able to explore the neighborhood more for pre- and post-dinner activities.SERVICE -- Upon arrival, we were greeted with our tables ready and customized menus. �� The server (I forgot the gentleman's name) was very pleasant,"
"Justin W. hits the nail on the head. Super dawg for everything, Wiener circle for the char dog and cheese fries and Hot Dougs for the specials. If your married you will sneak out on your spouse and kids just to enjoy your Super Dawg alone."
"OMG! They make a mighty fine sandwich here. Always a little on the spicy side. You can always tell them to tone it done. Tiny bit expensive, so I don't eat here every week. When I do I love it!"
"Top notch food... but they shouldn't have their kitchen in the front window if they want to drop food on the floor only to pick it up and put it on a plate. I noticed multiple health code violations the city must just ignore. However, I still say the food is amazing!"
Cool place and ��yummy. My friends and i have been here many times. ��I can't remember the names of the dishes but they were ��all good! I remember when i first moved to the area in 2007 i went for the first time and ��it was so good i went back a ��week later it was shut down. I was upset soooo thats why ��i just loving seeing all the great reviews because i loveeeeee this place!!! ��rock on Opart!!!
great steak ever! highly recommend.
OMG! The first thought that pops into my mind thinking of the food here! This place is phenomenal! Seriously people the food is extraordinaire......A friend and I came here last night for dinner and fell in love with this place...Informative...friendly and attentive staff.......Our waiter was super nice and always kept checking on us.....The Decor:Super cool brick walls.....Stylish paintings everywhere.....Cute tables with comfortable chairs....very roomy....and 4 different sections with 2 bars and an outside sitting area.....The Food:To drink we ordered Nero D'Avola Sicily Red Wine and it tasted like heaven in a bottle! Very tasty not dry and not to sweet but just perfect wine to accommodate our dinner....For appetizers we got Green Tamales which were made with poblano peppers...corn and 
"very good mix of traditional and creative Vietnamese dishes, and a ton of food for the money. My mother, who is picky as all hell, actually loves everything she's ever had there, which says a lot. The owner is omnipresent, day or night 7 days a week. I think he may keel over at any moment, but he is constantly checking on everyone. that said, he could hire some help, as service can be slow."
"I love this place. ��Great �� carne asada tacos, ��chili rellenos and orchata, I go here for lunch and ��then sometimes at like 3 am after ��being ourt all night with friends and ��its ALWAYS great"
"Simply love this place, food is always scrumptious and they incorporate seasonal favors!"
"I simply love this place. Their owner is really friendly. Every time I walk in, he has a big smile on his face. I love their rousted duck sandwich. I am a Chinese. I am from China. I usually do not eat sandwiches in a Asian restaurant. ��However, I just love their sandwiches. I probably will try other flavors next time. If you live close by, this is a place you cannot miss. Their combination is great."
The ��Chenjeh and Koubideh is very juicy and well seasoned. ��I always get the dill rice as it pairs well with everything. ��The lamb shank in the cinnamon tomato sauce is great and the meat falls off the bone. ��The hummus isn't my favorite but the rest of their menu makes up for it. ��I think I've tried pretty much everything on the menu from the Lake Superior whitefish to the Gheymeh Bademjaan and I'm a fan! ��Try the hot tea also.
"I planned the first bar of a party here. ��When I first called about the party, I spoke directly with the owner and he was more than happy to help me throw the party I wanted for my friend. ��I came in once before the event to chat with him and the manager about the day, and they were both very friendly and welcoming and I knew that this bar was the perfect place.The day of the event, our server was great and around often, and the owner came over a few times to make sure we were having a good time. ��We had left a little earlier than planned, but only because my friend wanted to get up and dance (and as fun as this bar was otherwise, it wasn't the place for a dance floor).In planning the event for my friend, I called/emailed a bunch of different bars to see what their deals were, see what typ"
"Waitresses and staff expect newcomers to know the drill. Rush and act impatient while customers are ordering. Food is decent, some dishes unique but after a few visits and the same old condecending ��treatment , I will give my business to someone else. 3 1/2 stars for food NO stars for wait staff and attitude."
"Who wouldn't love Fogo 2 Go's Decasa Salad; blue cheese, chicken, ample amounts of onion and tomato covered with a great balsamic vinagrette ... this is all topped on a pita which soaks up the dressing and makes an amazing dinner for only $5.65! Problem is getting your order correct!!!!! I live down the block and regularly call-in there, my order is never right, three times I have had to go back frusterated ��because the order was not mine or my oreder was reliant on the ""scattered"" order taker who inevitably messed it up! I recently sent my daughter to go pick up our dinner, on credit since we encountered 3-4 mess ups in last two weeks, the cashier was not aware of the credit and demanded the payment,. My daughter, a now horrified teen, was really embarrased.! I had to call and remind the "
"There were lots of favorable reviews. We gave it a try. What can I say? No, no, no. Do not go. Yes, the portions were enormous and it was inexpensive. If that's all that matters, pig out. Otherwise, listen up: Tasteless, bland food. Neither food or dining area was aesthetically pleasing in any way. The place smelled like a mix of grease & heavy duty cleanser. The only positive thing I can say is that the staff was professional & knowledgeable. What's with the 4 and 5 star reviews??"
Well went there this past weekend and I am only giving OK because the food was Excellent. The staff was a little less then OK. The outfit the hostess was wearing when I walked in almost made me close my husbands eyes based on it being way to revealing and some what strip club look. The waiter was average but we waited almost 20 Min's to get a refill on a coke and a glass of wine even though it wasn't that busy. The reason why I still gave 3 stars is the food was Amazing!!! Just please get the service under control and I Will definitely be back. No private dances please my husband heart couldn't handle the stress!
"Great food, VERY rich flavors for those of you easily overwhelmed. ��The food was great and was exactly was i wanted. The service on the other hand was horrible. ��The server around 30 to pick up our cards ��to pay the bill and before then was never around. ��food gets and A+ service gets a D+"
I liked the dishes served there. I visited this restaurant twice earlier but I became a regular customer of it because their dishes and other services are beyond imagination.
"Longman & Eagle was a surprise dinner for my husband when we traveled to Chicago to celebrate his 40th Birthday. ��So much of the yelp reviews are very true and on target. With so many wonderful food places to choose from in the city, I wasnt sure what his response would be. Longman & Eagle was an A++++ for unique food, atmosphere, and fab drink menu. ��My husband kept ordering and ordering items from the menu! ��We left wondering how to replicate the tartare which melted in your mouth. Waited for a table on the outdoor patio, and enjoyed people watching in Logan square."
"OK... I haven't been to Nuevo Leon in over a year and maybe I remember it better than it was... and OK... any restaurant can have an off night. ��However, last night the guacamole had the most off-putting taste, texture and a very unnatural sheen... like it was blended with vegetable oil or something. ��The chicken in my enchiladas looked and tasted like distressed shoe leather. ��The mole and the green salsa were excellent but the red salsa had no flavor at all. ��My dining companion had a somewhat tasteless pork dish that she wouldn't eat... although since I've never had it before, I had nothing to compare it to. ��This certainly wasn't the Nuevo Leon I remembered."
Great sushi rolls ! Very good place for people who have freinds that do not eat fish also . They do bbq as well beef pork etc. Very nice for a person who can not get her freinds to touch sushi.Go here .
"Definitely waited for almost two hours, but it was worth it. ��In addition to whichever inventive dog strikes your fancy, try the corndog (surprisingly our favorite) and get those decadent duck fat fries. ��Just do it. ��and don't be intimidated by the line - take a friend or your smartphone or a book and the time will pass reasonably quickly. ��Cash only."
"As a long time resident of Lakeview, I'm thrilled that Crisp has taken up residence in my neighborhood. I've been here many times and the food and service are consistently great. The staff, Jae (owner) and Jon, are really nice guys and very helpful. The wings are, in my humble opinion, the best in the city. They're huge, meaty, and the sauces are delicious. Five wings are probably enough to make most people full, but I usually order 10 pieces and split them between my two favorite sauces, Seoul Sassy and BBQ. The wings are a must have, but if you want to try something else, ask Jon at the counter because he knows the menu backwards and forwards, and will give you an honest recommendation based on your preferences. With Jon's help, I soon branched out and tried many of their other items. Th"
"Prrrrrrrrrrrrrfect! Prefix is the way to go. choose corn for desert its the best. Will continue to go back, I am so impressed."
"Learned a valuable lesson. ��If you experience poor service, complain to the managers immediately! You might get your dessert comp'd at best. Don't bother using their website, nobody checks it. Was there with my son a week ago and didn't want to ruin the dining experience for him and thought I could communicate with the restaurant through their website. A week later no response. I followed up with a call and basically was told since I didn't address it that night, too bad and all they could do was refund the gratuity. How's that for customer service? No apology for not responding to my online correspondence or for the bad service. I escalated it to the owner and he was even worse. He definitely does not understand the concept of wanting repeat business."
I never thought I would wait 30min in line to get a hot dog but apparently I will be doing it from now on. ��Doug makes a mean wien.
Out of ice cream. Good whipped cream. Weird clientele. BYOB.
Pizza was really good...BUT I had my wallet pickpocketed out of my handbag here on Saturday night along with a handful of other people. Apparently the same happened last weekend too. Its being targeted by thieves as its popular and so busy.PLEASE be careful with your belongings. My pizza ended up costing me over $4000. Seriously!
"I was told this was the best pizza in Chicago. ��They were wrong! ��Their pizza isn't bad but doesn't compare to other outlets in Chicago. ��I ordered when I got inside from the line outside. ��They didn't give me the chance to order before I sat down! ��Go to Lou Malnatis, best pizza ever!"
"Enjoybale cubano. Made correctly, good size, served hot and juicy, and on better bread than most. I will say I've had better though at a better price. I also tried the pollo sandwich. ��Not so great. ��Very dry and processed. ��Could have made this at home. ��The yucca fries were, well, yukka. Perhaps if they'd been hot?I think this place could use a little quality control."
"Just as so many others have heard the raves of this establishment, it was for me a let down. I ordered pico de gallo for an appetizer and it was not fresh. I'm pretty sure it had been sitting in the fridge for some time. My main course, marinated skirt steak, was just ok, nothing to write home about. The only thing that I really enjoyed about the place was their own tortillas."
"I'm consistently amazed at how busy this place is but it's really no wonder cause they do an outstanding job. Mike Roeper is such a mench and really cares about what he does. the best beer list in the city, great mussels. Thanks for all of your help with Pierce Elementary."
"This place was awesome. A group of five of us ate here several weeks ago. The owner gave us a free dessert at the end of the night, which capped off an awesome meal of delicious (and ginormous!) plates, wonderful wine, and an overall delightful setting. Highly recommended."
My wife Thu Thuy and I had the pleasure of dining with our four boys in late December! �� We were visiting from southern California! ��The food was amazing and the service was incredible! ��The owner made a great effort to welcome our family! ��I highly recommend Simply It!Brad Trager
"This one of the most amazing restaurants ever!!!! My girlfriends and I sat at the bar. The bartender's name was Ricardo. He makes theeeee best Margaritas! The food is amazing...a knew way of looking at Mexican. I had the pollo con mole, so full of flavor. I can't wait to go there again. Hats off to Rick Bayless..."
Best cheap food in the area. I love the lake night walks down north avenue afterwards. Make sure you catch them when they just put new food out... not as tasty when cold. The falafel is one of my favorites in the city!!
"I attended Pequod's for the lunch special. I was disappointed to say the least. After a few sips of my Diet Coke I noticed something floating in it. I asked the waitress for a new drink about 10 minutes before we received our food. I did not receive a new one until about 10 minutes after we received our food. I did not receive an apology for the wait, or the fact that I received a drink with a mysterious object floating in it.The quality of the pizza was sub-par at best. The sauce is too sweet and there is way too much of it. ��There was also way too much crust which took away from the taste. ��I had heard raves about the caramelized crust, but I was not at all impressed. ��It' taste was a ��mixture of tasteless dough and burned dough.My experience was enough to convince me to not return."
Can I say yummers? So delicious. One of my favorite spots for delivery. I like to get the falafel sandwich with a side of grape leaves and hard boiled eggs. Their chicken schwarma is also the bomb! ��I also love going in there and picking favorites from the salad bar.
"Rick Bayless. The name is Chicago glory. Winning Top Chef Masters is like winning Art Prize, Bushido and the Chicago Marathon all in the same year. So, yeah, he's decent at his craft.Of Course everyone is raving about the churros and hot chocolate (I had the Barcelona-- if you know me you know there's a strange obsession there.)The couple together is like animalistic coitus of the mouth. I got jabbed in the ribs for moaning.The only problem here is that the tortas (okay these are really kinda like fancy, delicious versions of a toasted sub) are a bit pricey for what you get -- but there is the fact that you get free filtered sparkling water from a tap! How rad is that... I fucking love that shit!! I had the torta with suckling pig. Of course it was good, but was it $12 good... i guess rela"
"we love breakfast! ��aside from the wait if you sleep in, this is as good as it gets in chicago. ��the eggs are always delicious; the greek twist on all the menu items is refreshing and unique; the coffee is good; and the food is always fresh. ��the restaurant is usually packed on the weekends, but the crowd is never too loud and the service is prompt and friendly. ��we visit Meli regularly and are never disappointed. ��give it a try!"
"My favorite spot in the city! ��Great place to bring out-of-town guests or newbies to the city. ��If your looking for a real Chicago spot - this is it. ��30's art deco styling with a lot of charm ��DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and eat in the LOUNGE! ��It's just as good as the main restaurant but way more fun! ��Walk in and go to your left, they don't take reservations for the lounge - its name on the list / first come first serve - so get their early or expect to have a few cocktails before sitting. ��On Thursdays the jazz band is flowing and drink specials are too. ��No white table cloths in the lounge and CHEAPER food! ��The menu is not as big as the main dinning room, but easily as big as any other spot. ��Go for the lobster roll if you're not to hungry - so good. ��Or go for the lobster or fried sole.Grab"
"If I could give a 4.5 I would.Food: One of, if not the best steak I've ever had. Went with the NY strip (chefs cut). The lobster potatoes were absolutely amazing as well, I would highly suggest ordering them. Finished off the meal with the buttercake, almost undescribably good.Our waitress was very attentive and sociable as well.The only reason I gave Mastros a 4, is b/c it was somewhat difficult to communicate with my date at our table for two. I think it was a combination of the table seperating us a little too far, other tables being too close, and the music being a bit loud, perhaps.Had some good drinks afterwords at the bar. Live music and good drinks.Would definitely go again."
Simply perfect in every way. Very smart.
"hot dogs are good,burgers not so good ,lines waiting way to longnot worth the wait ,fries okay"
"I'm a first time Yelp-er, but my experience at Sprout was far too Yelp-worthy to deny my compulsion to do so . The space is very pretty, the menu reads like a dream, the food sings like a song, and the plates are all so visually stunning. It's an interesting combination of flavors and employing unique components that's very very neat and it still is very very soulful. The service was also impeccable, and I'm highly grateful for a lovely night."
I will always go and never get disappointed! I know this because every time i went i enjoyed the food and atmosphere! I went more than 8 times for sure!
"The best for Pizza by far! Sausage & Mushroom, thin crust, extra sauce & well done - you can't go wrong!And when in a pasta mood, Penne Pollo Basilico.....Prego!A stand out favorite for good quality Italian-American dishes, very family friendly."
I have been to Carnivale for 5 special occasions and everytime it was wonderful. ��Wait staff is extremely knowledgable and the atmosphere is even better.But the FOOD is to best part.Try the Ropa Vieja appetizer. ��Its the best thing i have ever tasted.
"I cannot recommend this restaurant enough! The presentations, atmosphere and staff are all first rate! A festival of the palate!I have been attending the Underground Restaurants since their inception, and will continue to frequent their restaurant.Valentine's Day was perfect!"
"Just came back from breakfast here today. I had the chocolate French toast tower (amazing, not overly sweet, and sits in a bed of banana foster sauce) while my mom had the black bean and sweet potato breakfast burrito (also delicious and comes with one of the best salsa verde sauces we've ever had). Both of us had to get to go boxes because the food was so good and good portioned we couldn't finish it all.Our server Maria was also the perfect touch. Very friendly, helpful and talkative when inquiring about the history of the restaurant.Would highly recommend this place for breakfast/brunch."
"Truly a wonderful restaurant, great food and impeccable service. ��A much deserved 3 star michelin rating. ��Highly recommended"
"Very pleasant Italian restaurant. ��Good food and service, reasonably priced."
This place is very interesting.We went with a medium size party & kids but the service was still pretty good. Its an experience the way the serve but the food was just alright & fairly pricey for alright food. Beverages are spendy & small so stick with water by at least try the traditional Brazilian beer ~ its funky!I wouldn't go again but I'm glad we went
"The rattlesnake hot dog is the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.It's worth the wait in line and don't be afraid to try something new. They do a good job of pairing the unusual meats with complimentary toppings. When I'm scared, I usually get my favorite hot dog plus an exotic one. Just in case.The duck fat fries changed my life. I dream about them."
Amazing food. Highly cultural environment. Valet parking. Great for parties.
"OK.... I'm a beer snob from San Diego. Let me start by saying that every beer we tried held up to the highest micro-brew standards. The pizza needs to cool a bit as it tends to be a little runny. The staff is rock solid and works their tail off. Our server was (Ryan), and seemed to be at 6 places at once. Still he meet all demands serving our table of 5. I would come back just for the beer and service. I knocked off 1 star only because of the pizza."
"The only reason this restaurant even warrants two stars for me, is the food was fine. Let me just say that a poorly trained, unfriendly wait staff can truly ruin a dining experience. We waited at our table for ten minutes before a waitress came to the table and asked, did anyone take your order? I told her no, and that we'd never been there before. She left...no, can I answer some questions for you...Boy, we were apparentley putting her out by our mere presence. ?When asked how the bone marrow was prepared, the answer received (while one of our three waitresses rolled her eyes) was in the oven....(pause)...melted ...REALLY?? ?My daughter asked waitress # 3 how long the bone marrow is roasted for....she seemed to storm off, come back, and answered 10 minutes. Hmmmm. By the way, they have so"
"Violet hour is one of my favorite places in the city. Both times I have been was on as Sunday, so it wasn't too crowded. This is the type of place where you HAVE to sit at the bar. It's part of the experience to watch your cocktail come to life. The drinks here are some of the best I've ever had! Sit with Henry, he's great!"
"One of my favorite italian places. The lobster butternut squash ravioli is so unique and wonderful. I recommend you get a reservation since it gets crowded quick on the weekends. Also, request a seat in the back room so you don't feel so cramped. Service is also excellent. Every waiter or waitress I have had has been beyond attentive."
"What a disappointment! Great design, great location, decent service but horrible food. TO THE OWNER: Fire your chef. Just don't even think about it, fire him or her. Buddy, I'm a small business owner, too. You will not make it with the current chef, period.There's been only a few restaurants in my life - I am 38 by the way - that I really hated the food. This is one of them. Man, at least one dish (or even the salad) should taste at least average, right? Not at ZED451. Will go there only for drinks at the terrace. Would rather fast over night instead of eating an apple there."
"Do NOT waste your money and time, ��There are better Cuban restaurants in chicago, �� I was there last nigh with nine other people and we will never go back. The service was horrible. The waitress forgot one drink, she never brought us an appetizer and a menu. Hostess was very rude, she kept giving us attitude because our party was not complete. When one of us asked a questions she snapped and got into an arguement. ��The food is not even good, I had four scallops with a scoop of rise $22.50."
"I thought this place was really good. At first I wasn't sure what to expect, the neighborhood isn't great and its sort of in the middle of nowhere (at least what I'm used to) but in the end it turned out to be a money spot. Once you sit down they bring you delicious chips to start your meal. This is always a plus for me, as I am usually starving by the time I actually end up eating dinner. The service was above average and the wait time for the food wasn't to bad. The burger I ordered was cooked very well and the merks cheese just added to its greatness. The specials of the day were solid and it seemed as if they had a good deal every day.The only complaint I had was the music was blaring. And not just any music, heavy metal music was ripping the artwork of the walls. If thats the kind of "
"Fox & Obel, I've tried to like you. ��I've given you too many chances, though, and I give up.I didn't give up on you when I was robbed by a guy you recognized as a regular thief when we reviewed the security tapes.I didn't give up on you the first time you messed up and left items out of my to-go order. ��I didn't give up on you the second time, either. ��I just swore I'd never do another to-go order.Today was the final straw. ��We attempted to eat brunch in the bistro. ��The wait-staff ranged from avoiding the patrons to ambivalence. ��The coffee was burned. ��Our food never came. ��We waited for 30 minutes for our breakfast before giving up, paying for our coffee, and leaving. ��How can you not notice that your tables aren't getting their food?!?! ��Gourmet my foot. ��We should have waited the 30 m"
"GREAT AUTHENTIC VIETNAMESE FOOD HERE!I love this place! ��The soup noodles are very good and very authentic considering Chicago. ��I highly recommend soup noodles from pho to bun rieu (tomato based soup) to bo kho (stew), etc.The vermicelli noodles or rice dishes with meat, shrimp, fish sauce falls more in the average category. ��But definitely decent considering your choices in the area. ��The prices are also very fair. ��You can enjoy a meal for about $10 per person easily. ��Best of all, the service is amazingly fast and orderly considering how busy they get. ��Overall, great noodle soup for good price!"
Delicious sausages and hot dogs every time. ��Everything is fresh and awesome!
"I love Yolk! This is the must visit breakfast place in Chicago! You going to have to wait for a table-but it is well worth it! I love the menu an the staff is great! It is never a dull moment because the place is always packed!I enjoy crowds, so the Yolk is my number one breakfast spot. I love the counter because I can see my food being prepared and you are always meeting people. So make sure you put the yolk on your list of spots to visit for a great bite to eat."
"My wife and I stumbled across this place nine years ago and have yet to find it's equal. Great portions, quality, and price. �� �� The burritos are (quite literally) my favorite. I've had them all, and the best are marinated steak, and the pork. If you're really in the mood, get them Suizo. Their cheese blend is amazing.  �� �� When eating in, I almost always order the Tampiguena. Wow! and the steak is cooked to a perfect medium rare (when asked). �� �� Their table salsa is never the same spiciness, which I love because it means there is no standard recipe and it's always fresh. Bonus: When we order a pitcher of margaritas, they not only bring a full pitcher but give you already full glasses. And they're strong. (the only place I've EVER known to do this!)Note: I sort of miss the ""dive"" aspect t"
Great food great time. Love it
"I love this place! ��I have been there at least half a dozen times and always the sushi is super fresh and the waiter is really nice. ��The white albacore tuna is to die for. ��It is busy, busy in there but if you go before 6:30PM you can usually get in. ��I like that it is BYOB too...."
"This place is incredible for the atmosphere. I'd never been to a fondue restaurant before, but the experience is a must. You don't come here for the food, but it's fun, and the food's not bad at all. The sangria is really good too. It's cozy and quaint so don't go alone!"
Ew. Blech. Ew. Overpriced.
"great ""outside the box"" food! I go there all the time for breakfast and lunch."
"We went into this place partly based on the Yelp reviews partly just a random walk in the area, which is known for good restaurants. We were lucky to get a table (apparently a cancellation) and were seated almost immediately. The waitress was very nice and friendly and professional. We chose that day's special, a ribeye steak, and picked some sides as well (blackened cauliflower, special fries) and got very good information on everything including the beer selection. The meat was unbelievably good and the sides were very good. The beer was even superb!The place was casual yet had its own elegance and a nice atmosphere with a mix of young and somewhat older people. It was a bit too loud with the music (we were right by a loudspeaker) but apart from that, it was really a superb dinner. I wou"
"nothing like a good hot dog, especially in Chicago!! these were amazing!!"
This is a nice comfortable neighborhood bar you can go to relax and have a few laughs with friends. The price is fair and the menu selection is good.
"Wakamono always had great Sushi, but they have the WORST SERVICE out of any Sushi Restaurant in the City! We waited 2 Hours for a Table on a Saturday night after being told it would take about 45 minutes. We received the Bill with a $16 corkage fee for the bottle of wine we had brought. I asked to speak to the Manager, politely asking what she could do for me because of the extremely long wait. She explained that everyone waited about 2 hours and would not even take an app off of the bill. When I asked to speak to the Owner or another manager she yelled at the table saying she was in Charge. I used to love Wakamono, but there are a lot of Sushi Restaurants in walking distance. VERY OVERRATED..... WORST SERVICE...."
Ummmm -- pork and stuff is sooo 2009. ��Whatever.The place is trying too hard to be something that just came and went. ��The staff was uninspired and the place felt cold and not interesting.Don't waste your time or money.
Great service and great food. Owner is extremely personable and remembers us every time we go in! Everyone is extremely friendly. Food is great; very flavorful but also light and fresh. Pho is amazing as well. Every time we eat there we see someone else getting something that we want to try the next time we come. Very fairly priced. BYOB too!
Coming from New Orleans this pizza was Freeking incredible. It takes about 30 minutes to get a pie here and if it's real cold outside you can't sit by the windows without dying from exposure. It's about 5 degrees here today. Waitress was kind and had nice lips too.
"My fiance and I went to this restaurant since it had been recommended by a friend. We were very let down- the quality of the food just wasn't what the pricing would suggest. First, we ordered the roasted autumn squash tart- which was decent but nothing to rave about. We also had the potato/semolina dumplings, which were terrible. The tomato sauce tasted like it came straight out of a jar of Ragu. It definitely was not worth paying $20 for. We also ordered the caramelized lobster and were again let down. We paid way too much for just a mediocre meal- there are so many other restaurants to eat at that I wouldn't recommend this one. The presentation of the food was nice, but not very high quality."
I was in town on Business and my boss who lives in Chicago brought us there for dinner. ��It was definitely unlike anything I've ever had in a Pizza. ��We tried 4 different Pizzas and they were amazing. ��The owners told us the story about how they met in Brazil and where the recipes came from. ��The food was so good that we got Pizzas delivered to our hotel room the next couple of nights too. ��Can't wait to go back and support a solid local business like this one.
"Great food, friendly service. �� What more can a person ask? ��In this day of snotty waitstaff and poorly seasoned, overpriced food, it is refreshing to find a place where the owners and staff really seem to care that you enjoy yourself. ��I have enjoyed the empanadas, just enough ""bite"" to the crust to contrast wonderfully with the perfectly seasoned stuffing inside. ��The green and sweet plantain make me think of my Aunt's wonderful cooking. ��The chicken sandwich, the shakes, my mouth is watering just thinking of it.  And, by the way, what is up with the ""hater"" profanely talking about the sign up front? �� ��Great food and friendly people!!! �� That is what this should be about."
"Wow, what a terrible way to end a fabulous weekend in Chicago. And when we think of the great restaurants we did not go to tonight, I could cry. Place was empty, I think there were no more than three tables occupied. We went for the five course tasting menu, and I can only say I am glad we didn't waste more money on the ten course meal. It seemed that they are interested in Serving the most pretentious combination of flavors and textures they can put together, presented by a waiter who acts like he is serving nectar and ambrosia. The tiniest portions, served on barren white plates that only accentuated the absence of real food. It was so awkward, and we had no fun as we trudged through one course after another. Who has persuaded these people that this is a pleasant way to entertain people."
"I won't support an establishment that treats its staff so poorly. ��I heard harsher words than those quoted by Hela V, but which aren't fit to post here. ��The owner seemed to treat his staff like imbeciles or disobedient children, not like adults he has hired to work for him. ��And this is what could be overheard from the front, I can only imagine what goes on in the back. ��The food is wonderful. The service left nothing to complain about. ��But I won't be back and would only recommend others take their business elsewhere as well."
"Don't listen to Jeff R, he's an ass who cheated one me. I took him here as a suprise for his birthday, but I was the one surprised when I found out he banged the flying wino (the trapeze girl, or whatever). Make sure not to miss out on the the potatos au gratin!!!!!"
Had a five star experience the potato tacos are out of this world!!!!!!! the delivery staff got a 6 dollar tips for speedy service... and the steak sandwich tasted as good as it smelled....
This place was incredible.. EXCELLENT service. so much fun. the environment was so unique.... This was our first time there and we had fun trying Greek food. it was delicious! not that expensive for chicago. Oooo and our waiter was HOT.
"This place is like The Cheesecake Factory on Steroids! And the Cheesecake factory is like Friday's on Steroids. So if their was a street fight to the death between Gran Lux and Fridays, it would not be pretty. I had one of the pizzas and it was excellent. The crust was so unique. It was the thinnest crust I had ever had, which made it very taste. Anyway, it is a little over the top, but I really like this place a lot. Go here, and come hungry!"
"I used to like Garcia's back when they weren't so big and popular. The food was great then and the service was not so bad. I went there sometime in december 2011 with my husband, and the food was bland, the service was even worse. It took the waitress way too long to get our check and didn't even pick it up after 10 minutes of the checkbook with our credit card hanging out sitting on the table. We tried to get her attention but she was just way too busy. Finally we got fed up and i just paid up front. I had better service in Paris, and there usually is only one waiter/waitress for an entire restaurant/bar there. The only reason for my one star is because they havent taken away the ridiculously large horchata cup, but even so, the quality of their horchata has gone down. Never ever ever wil"
this is not good Korean food. everything there tastes like frozen dinner style Korean food... very disappointing.
"Nice live music is all that's good there. The food is below average...I mean, how can you justify offering one choice of dressing for your salad on a meal that is $50+ a plate?! Very crowded for a romantic cafe, tables are set right next to each other. $200+ bill for not much to remember..."
omfg!!!!! love love love love love love. everything ive tried is great!
"What can be said about Xoco that has not already been mentioned? Rick Bayless is a chicago legend and has certainly earned his stripes. The food here is very unique, not what you would call your average latin american food, but for Xoco this is a good this. The Agua De Fresco is to die for, i highly reccomed you get the water of the day. I had the roasted pork on ciabatta bread and loved every minute of it.  ��The guac was the best i have ever had and i really don't even care for avacado. This place is a solid bet if your in the loop and want something quick, tasty and unique"
"I had food delivered from this place, so I don't know what it's like dining there, but I didn't like the food, or the service. When I placed the order, the person said it would be a half hour, and it took about an hour and 20 minutes. Also, I ordered and paid for spring rolls, that they forgot to bring. The food they did bring sucked in my opinion. I had shrimp fried rice, which was super greasy, with only a few mooshy shrimp. I had an order of the mongolian beef, which was skimpy with greesy sauce, making the vegetable super soggy. The few non-scrappy beef pieces were pretty good though. We had the garlic chicken which was also skimpy, greesy, and soggy. I won't have food delivered from here again. If dining in the restaurant is better, or if they were just having an off-day, I guess I ca"
If I could I would swim in their awesome beer then get out and sleep in delicious New Haven pizza. This is my favorite pizza place and favorite sports bar.
"From the moment my husband and I walked in, we were greeted into a warm and friendly environment. ��The popcorn is not just a fad or trend it is actually the best I have ever had. ��The server was beyond cool and very opinionated which I love. ��The food was very good, the only negative thing I can see.....is that the appetizers are far better than the main courses. ��While I wanted to finish every morsel of the Wisconsin Risotto, the Deconstructed Italian Beef, etc. I was only mildly impressed with the main courses that we ordered...Sturgeon and Pork Belly. ��The wine was BEYOND reasonably priced and the desserts (although small) were yummy! ��If we had the budget we would be regulars!! ��I have sent three couples there since dining there last month, and they all left happy!"
"SSGS is one of my all time favorite rest. of all time. But for the past 2 recent visits. I can't stand the waitress anymore. My workers and I used to come here around 2-3am when we got off from work. Please look at your bill CLOSELY, b/c they might charge extra fee in there. The waitress complained my friend gave $6 tip was TOO LOW. (BILL WAS around 38.00)  2nd time, I was there with 2 adults and 1 baby. We left $8 tip on the table, the waitress just swing right by and grab it. Than when we got the bill, we got another extra 10 bucks in there. I asked the girl, she said it was for the tip. .. The total bill was $54.00... She was mumbling in Korean than she said: ""so you gave us $18.00"". I was like wdh.. I demanded the $10.00 taken off from my friend's credit card. She had to do it 3 times "
"My lady friend and I were on our way to the Planetarium and found ourselves driving through Greektown. We were hungry so we parked by the dog park on Sangemon, and walked towards the Greek restaurants on Halsted Street not sure where we would get a quick bite.We saw the outdoor patio at the Greek Islands and thought...it's such a beautiful day (Aug 18, 2012) with the temperature in the mid 70's...let's eat at Greek Islands.We walked into the restaurant through the long corridor and asked the hostess if we could eat outside. A man standing nearby (who was probably one of the Greek owners) barked out rudely in that classic Greek accent, ?NO, ITS CLOSED--TOO COLD!!!With that, he turned away not giving a damn whether WE thought it was too cold. He didn't offer a nice table in the restaurant an"
"If you like thin crust pizza, this is great. ��It's perfectly crispy (without being cracker-like). The sauce and ingredients are clearly fresh. The service was exceptional. It was snowing like crazy and my pizza was still delivered in under 45 minutes by a smiling delivery driver. ��I will definitely be ordering from them again."
"Food - great! ��Noise - earsplitting. ��I will never come back to this place. ��My friend and I could not talk to each other without shouting. ��The room acoustic is so ""live"" that everthing from kitchen noise to table noise to conversation noise is so amplified that it made my ""dining experience"" totally horrible.My table was in about the same spot the stage was at the old ""Madrigal's"" male stripper bar. ��It was less noisy then even though there were drunk people stuffing money into g-strings.Best of luck. ��If you need me, I'll be at Calo."
"The owner of this establishment is crazy!!! ��I was dining there last night and watched him scream and swear at diners at the table next to mine. ��Evidently he felt it was too much work to split the bill and gave them a very hard time about it, even following them out side to continue his rant. ��Honestly I thought he was going to hit them, all over the very simple request to divide the bill. ��If I hadn't of witnessed it I would have never believed it ��Suffice it to say I will never return. ��The crepes were just ok, the service meh and the owner completely insane! ��Diners beware!!!"
"Worst dining experience EVER. Aside from the decor, there is not a single reason to even THINK about going to this place. The food was horrible - down right awful. The tuna roll (Tails of two Tunas) was the most rotten sushi I have ever been served. A sushi cart on Division would be a better option, even in June. The pork belly was pork fat, decent flavor if you could get past the mouth full of fat, which I couldn't. To top it off, our waitress couldn't be bothered with us. We had one drink that took about 15 minutes to arrive and she never came back for a second drink order. I could go on and on about how awful this is, but I think I've covered the key points - bad food and even worse service. ��There are far too many incredible places in the city to give this a second try. Really, really "
Sooo amazing! One of my favorite restaurants of all time! I absolutely love their steak and corn cakes. Everything there is so delicious; I also enjoy Frontera's line of salsa and guacamole mix!
Take Awesome...mix it with chicken wings and you get Crisp. ��Best Chicken Wings and Chicken Dinner... Love to eat here with all my friends and try out all their unique drinks. ��Their mushrooms... amazing. ��Their wings? ��Even better. ��Great location and the people are always talkative and fun to order from. ��Def feels like its a healthy dinner
Had a 1:30 p.m. Reservation for Mothers Day (12 Persons). We were on time. The lobby was packed people were carring food over their heads into the main restaurant. We were told that they had over-booked and that the 1 p.m. reservations had not been seated . After waiting 20 minutes we left.NEVER AGAIN.
"Just fantastic! ��Loved every dish, especially the cheese course/grilled cheese! ��Service and atmosphere are fantastic as well. I was dining with two avid fans of Sprout and Chef Dale (one who is a world traveling foodie and thinks Sprout could be his favorite restaurant in the country right now). ��Both were sad to see the change in the menu format, but they still love it and will keep coming back. We all Strongly recommend!"
Best deep dish pizza around. you WONT find better I promise. The only thing that stinks is waiting for the pizza itself! But it's worth it and thats why there are appetizers right!?
"5 stars alone for the gorgeous outdoor space. ��Must visit on a warm summer night and sit outside.Also enjoyed the menu very much. ��Portion sizes are a little lighter, everything we've tried has been delicious. ��Love the grilled octopus and also the fava bean pasta.Great service, great food, great wine, and terrific ambiance."
"Love this restaurant! ��Great food. ��A little expensive for a family but the food is something you will be talking about long after it is gone. ��Loved the beet and carrot dish, haven't had anything like it before. ��I'm a meat eater but I prefer the vegetarian dishes here. ��The coffee is wonderful!"
"Man...everytime I eat here, I fall more in love with the place. ��My city friends love it, because you pay Carmine's prices and you get better food, more food, and pay a fraction of the cost. ��I regularly stuff my fat little face with veal parmigiana, but have also had the chicken. ��You get salad and soup with all entrees. ��It's a steal. ��If you want amazing food and enjoy feeling like you are about to explode from over-eating, go here. ��Also, the waiters are the nicest, most attentive people in the business. ��I can't say enough great things about this place."
"This place has excellent Italian food, and their menu changes weekly, which shows that they serve fresh, new creative dishes. ��I had Tilapia with tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers in a Tarragon butter. ��They serve you hot Italian bread with a side of cheese. ��While I dont recommend the Caesar salad, the bruscetta looked great.Also, I dont usually order dessert, but save room for their incredible Tiramisu!!!!"
Service is ok. White dragon rule is the best sushi I've ever had. Hands down.
"I have never been to a Brazilian steakhouse so I wasn't sure what to expect, it's overwhelming but awesome! ��The salad bar selection is tremendous and definitely offers you a little bit of everything! There is also a large variety of meat, the only downfall was we didn't know all the different kinds of meat and we were just guessing as they walked by and some walked by so fast we didn't even have a chance to see what it was :( Luckily, we had a great waiter who gave us recommendations and made sure certain meats were brought to us. He was very helpful and definitely navigated us through the experience. ��If you go, make sure to ask to try the house specialties, both drink and meat, you won't be disappointed! ��Also if you are a dessert person, try the banana foster pie. I am not a pie person"
"I saw this place on a TV show about the best hot dog joints in the country.Took my teenage son there to make it an experience. ��We definitely liked the food, service was good, and cheap eats.Now on to other must visit places."
"As for Piccolo Sogno, I give it a C-. When I called to make a reservation, the ?girl said, 5 or 9!! I said 5 and we were promptly there at 5. The patio was filled with men all dressed in black. ?The stick man 6 ft. 5 110 lbs. who greeted us said Sit at the bar!! which we did. We ordered a drink. ?B4 the bartender had time to make our drinks at the bar, someone had opened the trap door in the patio and all the little men in black disappeared. I figured they were running a class, teaching the men in black how to wait tables...they led us to the fake leaf wall in the back and seated us. My guest was seated FACING THE WALL!! instead of the dining room. ?A senior citizen (dressed all in black) came and gave us menus. After we had time to decide what to order, the little man in black came runnin"
"I've been going here for years! Love everything about it. Dark, great service, and amazing fondue. Very romantic. Actually, the most romantic restaurant that I have ever been to. The food is so fresh and delicious. Worth every penny. It's super classy, but relaxing at the same time. Never had a bad time or meal here! Love it!"
"I cannot figure out why they make people wait outside for at least a half hour when it's 30 degrees outside. ��Does it really take that much time to make a list? ��But that's the kind of establishment this is, overly pretentious just for the sake of being pretentious. ��No rhyme or reason to any of it. ��They ignore empty drinks, the waitstaff and bartenders get angry if you waste their time by asking about the drinks, and it is just generally unwelcoming. ��When we left, the bouncer/host was standing at his booth, seemingly doing nothing. ��I exited to see the long long line of people waiting to get their name on a list. ��Seriously, why do they make people wait outside just to make a list? ��Maybe it's funny to have a long line of people standing at a blank wall on Damen, only to turn them away."
"I'm a Chicago native and I because I worked for Lettuce Entertain You I was able to come to Shaws knowing I could get $15 off right off the bat. ��I had only oysters, my date had the sushi, which she was really craving, and we shared a bowl of the excellent clam chowder. ��The Oysters Rockefeller is superb although it didn't come with bacon bits. The menu is pricey, but I've seen restaurants of this ilk charging much more. �� They also didn't carry Goose Island Greenline which i put me out but overall GREAT experience and good service."
Amazing Cuban food. ��Amazing Cuban coffee. ��Kind of small so I generally take everything to go.Thanks
"The original location of Girodano's is still putting out delicious stuffed pizza, and the cheese alone is out of this world. They don't slather much sauce on their pizza, but if they did, you'd probably only be able to eat 1 slice. Pre-ordering your pizza when you walk in the door is a little odd, but the wait allowed me to try the spicy Italian Beef. The Italian Beef calzone with hot peppers was delicious, and they serve it with some au jus that really gives that beef a savory kick. The amount of peppers on it was perfect-not too spicy, but definitely a flavor party! I liked Giordano's much better than Gino's East; the latter's cornbread crust really turned me off, to be honest."
"It was a great experience for me and my wife. The meat was as expected excellent but the salad bar was for my surprise in another level and to top it off they even had a sushi stand, that most of the customers didn't realize it was there. By the way great show looking at the girl searching for the wines."
The absolute Mecca for all Foodies visiting Chicago- ��Encased Meat Heaven- Duck Fat Fries- I couldnt wipe the smile off my face for hours afterwards...A Must Have Experience...having Doug himself personally take your order- starstruck ;)
"Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!! I've been to Ruths Chris a few times and I must say it will always be one of my favorite places to eat. The great thing about it is they serve some of the best escargot in the city, something I dont seem to find often. The fillet mignon is amazing!If you have not eaten at ruths chris, you've been missing out!!!-Anthony"
"My first dining experience here was phenomenal, which is saying a lot considering I was on one of the most infamously horrendous dates of my life. It was a dinner date and the food outshone the rather lackluster company so much so that I've been back every week since. While the dinner is fantastic, as many of the reviews will attest, it's not my Longman meal of choice by a long shot.Typically, if I'm not downing Manhattans at the bar late night, I'm licking my wounds at brunch the following morning. I cannot say enough nice things about Longman's brunch. The service is always stellar. Friendly, but not cloyingly so (an essential component of successful early morning interactions) and they're always ready with helpful recommendations when I'm feeling indecisive. The manager, Alex, is super "
"Such a cool spot. ��The cocktails are top notch, even if they are a bit expesnive, you are paying for the experience.I wish my hometown had a prohibition bar like this. ��Everytime I visit Chicago (which is once or twice a year) I have to go to the Violet Hour!"
"Had lunch here last week, and loved it. ��I had the Xoco salad with pork, and my friend had a sandwich. ��There was a long line, but it moved surprisingly fast considering it was lunch on a Friday afternoon. ��The only reason I gave 4/5 stars was that I would have loved to be able to get their sandwiches as a salad - a great option for those with food allergies."
"The top 5 best encased meats (from a restaurant) that I have ever had have all come from Hot Doug's. ?The Andoullie Sausage (The Salma Hayek) is, hands down, the best encased meat I have ever had anywhere in the world. ?I highly recommend Hot Doug's as one of those places you have to take your out of town friends who come in for a visit. ?As for the long lines, meh, people wait longer outside night clubs for an experience that cannot possibly compare to fries cooked in rendered duck fat (available only on Fri. and Sat.).============================Ladies and Gentlemen: ?It's a hot dog shop, let's not act like it's a shrine to mankind. ?Indeed, the specialty dogs are pretty novel. ?It's great that you get a choice between steamed and grilled. ?The veggie dog is also pretty darn good. ?Altho"
"I joined Yelp just so I could give a glowing review of this place!I made a reservation for the Red Room (as suggested by the fellow reviewers on this site) and was seated promptly. My date and I brought a bottle of wine and a bottle of saki, and the waitress brought us saki glasses as soon as she saw we had it with us.The atmosphere was very cool and hip. Dimly lit, pretty artwork, nice music. The menu is extensive. We ordered crab rangoon and it was amazing! My main dish was the Indie Signature Curry and it was fantastic, so rich and aromatic with so many different flavors. Definitely ranks up there with one of the best massuman curries I've ever had. The plate presentation was also gorgeous. I felt like I was at a 5 star restaurant, not a small hidden joint in Edgewater! My date ordered "
We love this restaurant. It's like Europe when we're sitting on the patio. The food is great and the service very attentive. ��Highly recommend
"Amazing, best breakfast in the city. Great location, except parking can be limited. Well worth a long walk for the huevos rancheros. A little expensive and eccentric, but overall a great place to take the family for a Sunday morning meal."
"Good but too pricey for fries Great place for a late night snack, but all in all they charge a bit too much for french fries."
sabertooth is excellent. saturday nights is the time to be there!
I love this place!!!! the people there are so nice too!!! It's definitely a family run restaurant which makes the service I believe more welcoming then a chain restaruant. I never give 5 stars to a place the first time i try it but i almost did here you have to try this place
Looooooooooooove it!! ��Wish I had a zillion dollars to eat there every week. ��Specialty rolls are all fantastic and crab salad is the best I've ever had. ��NOM NOM NOM!
"I tried this new brewery Saturday night with a few friends. ��I anticipated a hostile hipster crowd b/c of the area but I was pleasantly surprised that this place had quite an eclectic mix of people; older couples, younger groups and even families. We got there early (6:00 pm) and put our names in expecting a long wait. The host and hostess were extremely nice and seemed to have things under control with seating everyone in a timely manner and after about an hour wait, we were seated. We ordered the bacon fat popcorn, wings and the sausage platter to start. The wings were great, a spicy buffalo sauce that came with some type of potato salad, the sausage platter is what it is and the bacon fat popcorn...well I expected more. It was literally just popcorn sprinkled with parmesean cheese with "
"After suffering through a chilly midwinter run, the Significant Other and I wanted massive amounts of moderately healthful food, and we wanted it NOW. Simply It was nearby and well-reviewed, so we decided to hobble on over and check things out. ��Our ravenous, aching asses rejoiced when appetizers arrived soon after they were ordered. The avocado wontons--fresh avocado and cream cheese in a crispy wrapper--were more refreshing than any fried appetizer has a right to be. A banana leaf-wrapped sticky rice cake was a little bland, but the accompanying soy-based dipping sauce solved that minor problem.I fretted that a mere bowl of soup wouldn't be enough to calm my angry stomach. Thankfully, my cauldron of beef Pho, with its flavorful broth, tons of rice noodles, and big side plate-o-fixins (fr"
"I have visited this restaurant several times now when I'm visiting Chicago and the service, food, environment is absolutely tremendous. The men that bring the food around are always pleasant. The food is always hot, well seasoned, and just down right delicious. It is a nice casual atmosphere that I just love to dine in. The prices are alittle high but, you get what you pay for. Whenever I make a visit I make sure to visit. Oh and by the way, try their warm pineapples. They are to die for. Excellent restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Living down the street from revolution means I'm here allot. Ive brought friends here, brought my parents here, Ive even brought my grandparents here. Great beer (though sometimes they're out of allot of things on the list) and fantastic food. There was a day where all I wanted was a chicken salad. I sat down at revolution by myself, had a beer, and ate this salad that was almost exactly how I imagined it in my head. It was week changing... Good story right? : p"
"I went with my friend for opening night and was thoroughly impressed. Great funky dining room, eclectic music, exceptional fare, cocktails, and service. The bone marrow with onion jam was not to miss. Our scallops were perfectly seared. My sazerac perfectly balanced. And 2 dollar PBRs? In River North? Fantastic. Ill be back."
This is the right way to do modern cooking -- the food is delicious - and the new combinations of ingredients all feel perfectly thought through - textures and tastes that resonate even though you would not have ever had them together before. ��the waitstaff is gracious and knowledgable - the prices quite reasonable considering the quality of the food. The ambiance in the room adds to the feeling of comfort - and the bar is lovely.
"Wow, lots of people hating on Irazu!Other than there being no place to sit except outside (cold much?) I think it's pretty good! And I am about the least adventurous eater EVER. Seriously, I've never had Asian food. Or mayonnaise. Check it out, the burritos are good, and it seems pretty authentic. No compaints. Stop hating!"
"The Bongo Room is possibly the best brunch spot in Chicago! ?My friend and I split the Chocolate French Toast Tower and the BLT Benedict, and both were amazing.The BLT Benedict was rich, but surprisingly not super heavy or overly salted. ?The Tower had a delicious milk chocolate sauce w/ a subtle flavor of banana and hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. ?Not too much mascarpone, which the toast was supposedly stuffed with, but I didn't mind b/c I'm not a huge fan of mascarpone overload. ?I can't wait to try everything else on the menu!"
"Got a menu in the mail from this place last week and thought we'd try it out. ��Ordered delivery last night... crab rangoon, tom kha soup, and red curry w/ chicken. ��Food was really really good! ��Everything was well prepared and very flavorful. ��We are so used to being disappointed when we order thai food, but this was a wonderful surprise! ��We are very happy to have found a great thai place in our neighborhood and look forward to ordering from there again, soon."
"The pickled tomatoes are the best, if you want one of the best hot dogs in Chicago you have to come here. i would not get the burgers those are a disappointment but the hot dogs are amazing. They make there own recipe and are just amazing. Keep it up guys"
"Yes, yes, yes! The fresh squeezed juice is bomb! The food is good, hot, fresh and served with a pleasant greating always!A great way to start your day any day!"
"This establishment would have received a higher star rating had the owners been absolutely honest about this restaurants concept. ��Sunda and its menu are not original concepts, it is a copy of a restaurant located at the Encore in Las Vegas, called Okada. ��The only problem is, Sunda doesn't do the concept nearly as well as Okada."
"I love their business pre fix menu. ��I always go with cha gio, and bun thit nuong. ��Their mango sundae is must, if you still have a space. �� I like their interior too, it' nostalgic and old fashion-like, so you can forget being in windy chilly winter."
"I had a recent 18 hour quick in quick out visit to Chicago. ��Upon arriving at 8pm I had plans to order in from Gino's East. ��However, everyone from the airport, cab ride, and hotel front desk all insisted I try Giordano's instead. ��As I am from NY... I find I am rather picky about the pizza I eat and rather snobby about it as well. ��My plan in ordering this pizza, as I must admit, was to say for once and for all that Chicago Deep Dish had nothing on NY, brick oven, thin crust. ��Well, my plan was ruined. ��The pizza was great. ��Now I am not going to compare and apple to an orange and say that which is better... NY or Chicago because the truth is they are completely different. ��But... this pizza did not disappoint. ��I ordered the deep dish cheese with mushrooms. ��The sauce was amazing. ��You c"
"Too many tourists and I really feel like this place is over hyped. ��I mean it's decent pizza and you a solid sense of what Chicago style pizza is but it simply didn't blow me away. ��I probably won't be going back here with so many other options for pizza. ��The deep dish is a less quality than a few other joints but the thin crust is solid but nothing to write home about. ��Possibly this spot gets a ton of business because of it's location and they skimp on ingredients or cooking times. ��Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, just not what I was hoping for"
"Terrible experience...Bad food, bad service...Don't bother going.You can say many things about this restaurant, but they don't serve Romanian food (and I am Romanian who knows what I am talking about...)"
"MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT BY FAR!This place blows most places out of the water. First, they give you this complimentary pizza bread when you sit down that is amazing, I could eat this stuff every day if I could...Usually, I order the same thing everytime - Chicken Piccato. Chicken that is lightly breaded with a butter, lemon, and white wine sauce with pimentos and capers. This comes with three good sized chicken breasts and a side of pasta as well as soup and salad.You get A LOT of food for your money, it's reasonably priced, dim lighting, and perfect for family dinners and date night. I HIGHLY suggest this place for your next Italian dinner. You'll love it :)"
"We were visiting Chicago and decided to test famous Chicago pizza. Everything was fine, good pizza, good time. ��However, my wife left her sun glasses on the table and when we come back ��to table - there were no glasses. ��We asked the waiter -and the answer was he did not see anything. ��The waiter asked other personal and after some checking the answer was still negative. �� ��I checked myself with the people who were seated at our table and they told me that they gave the glasses to the waiter, which we already asked. ��After short conversation and initially telling that nobody gave him any glasses, he finally pointed out on the pace where he placed them previously.This is my story about Gino's Pizza. �� Pizza is good but .......but bad feeling is still exist."
"I used to really enjoy Calo's, but this most recent dinner was a waste! ��I ordered for delivery, which used to be fine, but this was a waste of money, plain and simple! While the ribs were okay, they forgot the cole slaw, the roasted potatoes were awful, and the extremely small slice of cheesecake looked as though it had been dropped a few times. I guess it's back to reliable Leona's. ��This is the last time I'll order from Calo's!"
"I quit going to Bin36 for dinner a year ago and stopped going to have wine 6 months ago. ��The food and table service are as bad as people have already stated on Yelp. ��The clincher was when I brought 6 colleagues and the server was asked 3 times for a glass of wine. ��he kept forgetting. ��When I explained it to the floor manager (who was since asked to leave his job), he said ""hey it happens."" ��I was less happy when the poor service started happening at the bar too. ��I have been there so many times I am sure that it's just a bad place. ��A couple of the bar tenders are fine, but most seem pissed that they are there and are anxious to be offended. ��I saw one chastise a customer for reminding him he ordered another glass. ��And then I started seeing call girls at the bar with older guys from ti"
"We used a Groupon to try this restaurant after it was recommended by a friend. ��Not impressed. ��They sat us near a door on a cool evening, and everytime a person when in or out of the door we were hit with a blast of cold air. ��It was crowded so we couldn't move to another table. ��It took a long time for us to get our food. ��My hubbie's chops were overcooked and tough. ��My pork dish had little flavor. ��The best thing we ate was the bread and butter spread, flavored with something good, and the chocolate cake. ��We will not be going here again!"
"the Ecuadorian mahi was delicious with perfectly spiced veggies. ��wine was good and wait staff was extra nice. salmon is a little too fishy but overall, fish selections are impressive."
"Yolk is amazing! ��They have the best breakfast/brunch food I have ever had and you get so much food too. ��The one downside to Yolk is that they are always busy. ��The best time to come is an hour or two before close during the week. ��Otherwise, you can expect to wait about an hour. ��If you haven't been here before you need to check it out!"
"We got on the wait list for a table on a friday night. ��They said they would call my phone in 45 minutes. ��We killed some time at the book store and music store around the corner, then walked back over. ��Of course there still was a wait, so another 20 minutes till we were seated.We enjoyed the atmosphere and drinks. ��I can see returning, but the whole line at the door issue is stupid. ��Later in the night, the booth across from us was left open for a good 15 minutes before 2 people were seated, and this is a huge booth that can be easily split up to two groups. ��Seeing this, I thought the line outside must be gone, but sure enough there were 15 people crammed in the hallway as we left.The doorman was nice to us and appeared to be doing everything he could to seat people fast, but obviously "
"I've been to Nuevo Leon many many times. My rating for food is 'OK'. Most dishes are ok, food here is not gourmet. stick with basics - tacos, tortas, and gizados. Usually dishes with seafood that I've ordered are dry or left over it seemed.Gizado de puerco is the best if you're a pork eater. I wish they did their chicken enchiladas with diced sauted chicken rather than pulled-chicken since pulled chicken there is usually very very very dry and then they use a lot of it.The place could be sized down - remove a couple of tables - ��most of the times when you sit on tables with individual chairs you're right up against somebody and people are walking right in your face and food when it's really busy.Also don't ever peek into kitchen area.....I'll leave it at that. The waiting staff is usually "
"First time my wife and I went there, we were surprised that such a small place can have such a good food and service. ��Food gets made really fast and it's outstanding. ��It is very easy to find parking around the area. ��Continue the outstanding service and deliver great food."
"My special lady took me here for my 30th birthday. ��Believe the hype- this place is UNBELIEVABLE. ��The food (to-die-for delicious, inventive, unique), the service (friendly, helpful, attentive), the ambiance (gorgeous, serene, peaceful)... this place has everything, and does everything perfectly. ��You simply cannot top the experience of a night at Alinea!"
"Went there on a Sunday night and truly enjoyed their new pig roast entree, it was very flavorful ��with crispy skin. My husband had veal praprikash and it's always good. Last time he had goulash and he always loved it since he's Hungarian. ��We also had the sausage appetizer and it's grilled to perfect, if you don't mind the strong garlic taste. The accompanied polenta and salad were also very tasteful. We went to this restaurant over 20+ years since they were on Belmont and the food remained very good, but it's getting pricy without a coupon, also it'll be nice if small soup or salad is included with entrees."
"After following some many great review for this place, I checked this out the food was just OK I've eaten much taster middle eastern food else ware. I had an Chicken dinner which was served with spicy rice and salad with humus and pita bread. The rice was dry, cold had uncooked lentils the salad had too much tahani sauce ��and had no taste. The chicken was again cold and little flavor with humus ��being the worst i never had eaten humus so bad. How ever there are a few good things about this restaurant the food quantity is huge for the price i guess so many good reviews are due to this fact alone, it was a BYOB with out a corkage fee again a good one. I would suggest this restaurant if you wanted a BYOB with out corkage and did not care much about the taste of the food but was more intereste"
"Wow!! What great service! The general manager, Doug, made it possible for me to send my son at Northwestern University a huge delivery of cuban food as a surprise for his birthday. We're from Miami and I wanted him to enjoy the Cuban food he craves.I am sure he will be frequenting the restaurant with his hungry friends looking for that home-cooked cuisine. Thanks again for making a mom's wishes come true."
"Although I'm no vegan and cannot fully appreciate what that all entails. ��I will say that the only way I can understand this restaurant receiving 5 stars is if I were starved from all meat and dairy products for the next five years. I have been promised by many, that although a non-vegan I would still enjoy the fare. I can't tell you how false this statement is. The only redeeming quality of CD was their chocolate shake, but that could have simply been attributed to my unhealthy obsession with anything that resembles ice-cream, and well-it was chocolate.My friend and I split a BBQ bacon burger, sweet potato quesadillas, and sweet potato fries. I will say, the burger had amazing flavor, but I would much prefer a burger that wasn't terribly dry. The quesadillas were not impressive, and the s"
"My husband and I went on a recent Sunday night and after a ��couple of appetizers we cut the evening short and went somewhere else. ��The Rockit Bar people obviously had lots of money to spend ��and have borrowed heavily from other Asian venues. ��But they seem not to have truly comprehended the secrets of success. The room was striking and beautifully appointed but the menu gave us clues that it was going to be a half-baked, pan-Asian mess. ��For example, they listed five sakes by Gekkeikan and ��used the names ��Wagyu and Kobe interchangeably. ��Plus the wine list was filled with too many uninspired, big- producer labels. ��We ordered the Ultimate Hand Roll which turned out to be an inedible soggy mess of cold tempura and mushy crab. ��The ""Kobe"" beef on crispy rice was strangely flavored and ulti"
"I LOVE Meli's Cafe! I practically dream of coming home to Chicago for only two places: Giordano's (naturally) and ALWAYS Meli's Cafe. I'm not a big coffee drinker yet I love their coffee. The muffins of the day are usually great, especially the espresso one. Love the french toast, love the scramble specials. The wait time for a table becomes a distant memory once you sit down. You'll really enjoy and remember this place."
"Yes, it was a Saturday night and the wait was over an hour, but it gave us a chance to savor the bar. Wow...reminded me of my parents bridge club with the old fashions and manhatten. They were fantastic!! The food is truly edgy....but if you like the edge..this is it. The bone marrow with bacon/shallot jam was the closest I've had to a restaurant in Paris!!! Thanks for bringing a little bit of euro-flair to our American palettes!!"
"I went here for the first time with my dad today. Everything was delicious! The bread basket,our appetizer(grilled calamari), main courses, & our dessert(homemade tiramisu)! The place has an overall good atmosphere,very romantic. Bottom line: overall great restaurant,definitely returning,& would recommend to friends."
OKhere i go...i hardly go herebut i went to there thanksgiving dinnersOMG... its awesome food there....I'm going to give it 5 stars.. ��as when i did go.. ��they were so polite. there food was GREAT !!!!!!its a small joint with big hearts there !!!!!ill be back there again !!!!
"Went here ��shortly before leaving Chicago with some friends for a birthday. I must say meh for sure. My biggest problem was the service. 3 times we had to ask for our beers to be delivered to the table and that was round 1, round 2 had to ask twice, our waitress was often times no where to be seen which given the size of the place is nuts. I had a seared tuna that was again meh. This place is suppose to be known for fish but I thought I could of cooked it better. Also the sauce served with it left something to be desired as well. For a appie my husband and I had the calamari and ehhhhh never again and again we make better at home. I don't think this place will be in our rotation upon our return visits to Chicago."
"Worst service I've ever had. employees there so arrogant and has no clue on what service is. When I was guided to the table, one of the servers were wiping out the table surface. He just very briefly wiped the table once (you can tell that the table was still very dirty) and then started to put down folk and knife while leaving the rag he was using to wipe in the center of the table. what's worse was that he actually put folk and knife on the dirty rag!!I got upset and told him not to do that, but he did not even apologize but just made excuses. ��then He even told me to leave if I don't like it. What a stupid arrogant waiter! I never had a chance to try their food cause I left the place right away. but trust me. they are people never care about hygiene and service. No doubt that something "
"The Chicago Diner is a great place to eat if you have allergies or special dietary needs. They serve vegan food and baked goods. Personally I have only eaten their desserts. When I was younger I ordered a cake from them. It was good, however it did taste as if it was vegan. Since then I have eaten their muffins, cakes, and cookies. They have improved exponentially! Family and friends who have tried their desserts that eats dairy on a daily basis says it taste close to the real deal. You can purchase some of their items directly from the Dinner or at any local Whole Foods."
"Went here with three of my friends. We were seated immediately. I am not at all an expert in vietnamese food, but they seemed to have a lot of options. We decided to split a papaya salad and three entrees - tofu with sprouts, catfish in a clay pot, and some sort of chicken/lemongrass dish. The food came fairly quickly and everything was so delicious and flavorful. The papaya salad and the chicken lemongrass dish both had very fresh, bright flavors, while the catfish was nice peppery. I wish I had known the place was BYOB or I would have brought something to drink. But regardless, I very much enjoyed my meal and soon I'm sure I will return to try more of their dishes!"
"Had dinner at LaVilla on a Saturday night. ��Group of 10 people. ��Service was friendly, prompt and spot on. ��This is an rather nostalgic place that will take you back 30 years. ��Older building, dimly lit, paneling, a singer at the bar. ��Very joyful crowd. ��Everyone there seemed to be having a great time, including those along the bar singing along with the entertainer. ��A good place if you need a mood lift of to celebrate something.Drinks were good. ��Italian bread and pizza bread were both good. ��Arancinii (Italian rice balls) appetizer were excellent. ��Salad bar was straight out of the 1970's and mediocre, but it's included with entrees, as is soup. ��The spinach egg drop soup was delicious. ��The veal dishes were excellent, as was a steak special that was a steak covered in onions, crab mea"
The food is excellent... very fresh and served hot. ��The place is remodeled and now well lit. ��I have eaten at Frontera Grill and easily place Garcias right up there. ��One thing for sure that needs to be changed is the feel ��of the staff. ��They arent the nicest in town. ��They also tend to rush the meal. ��You can barely eat you app before you get your main. ��The sure enough comes the check.
"Ordered delivery, was slow but arrived hot. Had a medium thin-crust with mushrooms and olives. The thin crust was really not all that--it had a very doughy and chewy texture to it and not in a good way. Toppings/cheese and tomato sauce were yummy but a good crust makes a pizza."
Love this place. Great food. Dining in service is a bit slow but I never have ��problem with my pick up orders. I recently tried their Costa Rican iced coffee with horchata and I love it. The right taste of coffee with the right hint of sweetness. Totally replaced my regular cup o joe with the little green woman on it. The staff is also super sweet. =)
"Violet Hour experience # 1 : we'll do this bullet-point fashion...1-the ambience is simple, classic and nice. ��yes, very ny like, and the age ranges from mid twenties to upper fifties--which I thought was an interesting mix, in a positive way!2-do not attend this place if you're hungry, or anticipating a great eatery. ��Their sustenance menu could be better perfected--do NOT order the mini hot dogs or chicken wings, better elsewhere. ��The best : potato tater tots. ��Sort of a random mix menu...3-The wait actually isn't too bad. ��It's all a little hyped up, to be quite honest, as if you're walking into an exclusive club. ��They were very understaffed for ��Sat. night, but kind and unpretentious.Overall, would I go back? ��Maybe...if someone else in my party was itching to go. ��Would I recommend "
"I LOVE this place. The mussels, frites are to die for!"
"The classic clean design makes you feel at home immediately, like you're visiting your favorite southern aunt (not the one that smells funny and has lots of cats), and the staff was friendly, informative and eager to please. ��The real star, however, is the food. The salads were fresh, with a nice variety of leafy greens, and the cornbread croutons were a tasty and clever touch. The sauces could use a leetle bit of variation, but this may also come from the unfortunate side effect of having only one spoon to go between the three. The barbecue flight appetizer would be enough for a meal for a smaller person (like me), and gives you a good sense of what the entrees have to offer: the pulled chicken was flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth tender; the pulled pork was smokey and well-complemented b"
"the steaks are great but i'm giving this place two stars because of the lack of service. went a few weeks ago and boy are the bartenders S L O W. ��slow as molasses and don't listen very well. first it took them a half an hour to get to me while i was standing directly front and center of the bar. ��he had some guy's margaritas just sitting and getting watered down before actually pouring them. ��then another guy asks to keep his tab open, but then closes it. and an elderly couple was still waiting for their wine. it had been a very long time since i was there last, actually, when they first opened ��across the street from the current one �� i recall their empanadas to be the best i had ever eaten but was disappointed to find they had completely changed them. ��oh well. i'll give it another go s"
Wow. Seriously one of the best things I've eaten in Chicago. Go on Friday and get the duck fat fries. ��This is 100% worth the wait and will be a memory you'll never forget.
"The staff is COMPLETELY RUDE and they do not seem to care if they get business or not. ��I gave them a second chance today, and again they were so incredibly rude that we left and will not go back. ��They also refuse to let you take a stroller inside or outside to eat. ��How, exactly, do you bring a newborn to eat if you can't have a stroller? ��They are not family-friendly or friendly at all. ��Thanks to the internet, we can warn people before they waste their time or money."
"Delicious! After walking by several times and jealously watching the people sitting outside eating their amazing-looking rolls, I recently got take-out (Oedipus roll without mayo).It was amazing! The fish was delicious, the avocado was ripe, and the soy sauce came in a cute little bottle.I will definitely go back and try some of their other rolls soon."
"Falafel, hummus, shawerma....I have to say that Sultan's is one of the best Medi restauants in Chicago.The one on Clark is a little better, but you can't go wrong with either!"
"We were visiting Chicago and happened to pass by Purple Pig. ��Great food! ��Everything on the menu was delish. ��The only con would be the too tight seating arrangement and if you are not seated outside (we were initially sitting outside but it started raining and they moved us inside), the noise inside is way too loud that you have to yell at each other to talk. ��Overall, a must place to dine."
"Best place ever. The food is good, the price is okay...but it can a little bit crowded at times. Apart that everything is awesome. I like this one in the south loop better."
"My friends and I were really excited to go to Frontera on the recommendations of friends and it being a Rick Bayless restaurant. ��We were told it could take as long as 3 hours to get ��table but we decided to make a night of it and pass some time in the lounge. ��The drinks were great, the atmosphere fun and lively. ��Our hostess was super attentive and we managed to get a seat near the kitchen in a record 75 minutes!The guacamole was delicious, but the ribs some folks who were eating at the bar recommended were bland and we left most of them on the plate. ��The steak was very good but overall we were disappointed in the food. ��To add to that lackluster discovery we were harrassed by two gestapo like floor managers who insisted we sit still in our seats... apparently they worried we would some"
"With all of the wonderful Mexican food options we have available in Chicago, do yourself a favor and choose another place to eat. Having worked in the food industry for many years, I'm usually pretty easy to please. But I do care about customer service... which is something they could care less about at Neuvo Leon. I planned my small business' holiday party here because I'd heard it was a fun, inexpensive option with fantastic food, plus it's BYOB. When our party of 13 walked in last night, they had no clue we were coming, never mind the special family-style menu that had been selected the week prior. In fact, the manager thought it was more important to seal tortillas in bags rather than deal with this issue. They ended up throwing three mismatched tables together so we could squeeze into"
Frequent vistor. Love the decor and the massive menu. Sitting along the window provides one of the best views on Michigan ave to compliment your meal.
"This is definitely the best fondue in the city. ��The food and the atmosphere is ten times better than The Melting Pot chain. ��I also love getting the coupons in the mail for birthdays/anniversaries. ��I wish I got the coupons all the time so I could eat here every week! ��Otherwise, it's a little too pricey."
Love this place! Beer is awesome and you can even take a jug to go :-)
"Great place to try the deep dish pizzas. They are hit or miss in terms of my preference though. In any case, ask for extra cheese, it's worth it :D"
"Hot chocolate and churros...enough said, go check it out already!"
"This was the most TASTELESS Greek dining experience ever. Food was bland, and the GYRO was the worst I ever had, again TASTELESS. The Flamming cheese was not hot and tasted more like a glop of churned butter milk. I brushed my teeth several times afterwards, flossed and still had that taste in my mouth... The only thing that was good was the chicken, and who can mess up chicken?"
Fun atmosphere. Pizza and beer are very good.
"Today I was amazed, so amazed I had to open an account at YELP to tell the word about it. My husband had the breakfast burrito which was awesome. It is rolled tight and then the tortilla is grilled, so everything is nice and compact, not messy like most burritos. He loved it. It was freaking huge as most of there food seems to be. I had their version of a BLT-which is bacon and ham. Everything was fabulous. O.M.G! ��AMAZING! ��Our waitress Marcy made our first experience a very enjoyable one. She was great, and her sense of humor made our S. Pats day even better. Thanks to Groupon I discovered a perfect restaurant today. ��If there's one restaurant I'd recommend here in the city from now on, it's Cafe 28 FOR SURE!"
"First day in Chicago, I tried Lou Malnati's Chicago pizza and thought it was good.2nd day in Chicago, I explored Rush Street and decided to try Giordano's pizza. ��Giordano's for the win!The crust is thick. ��The cheese is a mountain. ��You get to pre-order so its ready to go when your table is.The atmosphere was fun, esp with it being happy hour on Friday.I will be back."
"I discovered this place by complete happenstance on the second or third day that it had opened. My sister and I were in the area and looking for a place to have lunch.We were warmly greeted by the owner, Jon and ordered our food - the taste of everything is just like in Italy. The oven roasted zucchini, the Buffalo mozzarella, the olive oil and garlic and the pizzas, well it does not get any more authentic than that. JUST LIKE ITALIA!! Every bite took me back to Europe and the bustling atmposhere in the evening adds to th experience (the wait can be long at times but well worth it in my opinion!)"
"Crappy week for dining out I guess, first the nightmare that is Kuma's then a misguided second (and for the record LAST) date that brought me here.I have reservations at a REAL romantic place ?That should have been the clue right there - as a general question, if THE selling point of a restaurant is that it is romantic, should one really actually EAT there, or rather should one endeavour to RUCK in a nice romantic motel perhaps and possibly EAT at a restaurant that is known for its FOOD.Let me count the ways here: ?Sectioned off into little weird subrooms with 1960s decor & art, dimly lit with a real low ceiling. ?Honestly, the dining room looked like the killer's house from Silence of the Lambs, only minus the big moth.Then I had to boil my own food in gross brownish oil that seemed (smel"
"My girlfriend and I were in town for Lollapalooza this weekend. We were looking for breakfast and not knowing the city or area, we stumbled upon The 3rd Coast. We loved it the first time, and came back for breakfast two more times during our stay! Food was great: we tried something different each visit. Our server(s) were also great. Thanks!"
"Pequod's used to be one of my favorite pizza spots in Chicago; after my recent experience with them I will never order from the again.After and hour and 40 minutes of placing my order I still had no pizza. ��I called to ask the status, the girl who answered was less than pleasant. ��When the pizza finally arrived, it was completely wrong. ��Wanted vegetarian and got all meat toppings. ��I called to complain and was only offered a $5 discount on my next pizza (oh excuse me, they would send me a new pizza but I think after an 1:40 minutes I would've been on to my next meal.) �� At least offer a free pizza!! ��NEVER ordering from them again."
A lot of hype around this place but it is alright. ��Nothing I would wait in line again for. ��Decent food.
"The food was ok, however the atmosphere was noisy and hard to get a table. ?More of a bar-type of atmosphere than a restaurant. ?The drinks were good, but it's not a place for a hardy dinner. ?The service was good and friendly with suggestions that let us try a large variety of things.Antipasti: - Broccoli w roasted garlic and anchovy vinaigrette = inconsistent in taste, some were very good and some tasted more sour.- Salt roasted beets, whipped goat cheese and pistachio vinaigrette = sweet, very good.Cured meats: - Prosciutto di san daniele = tasted ok, but nothing special.- Tartufo = a salami, tasted ok but nothing special.Cheese:- podda = a hard cheese, tasted ok but not what i really liked.- delice de bourgogne = smooth, mild taste. ?Tasted ok.- blu di bufala = blue cheese from buffalo"
"Mrs. Francesca can cook, but she can't deliver service... My girl friend and I met up for dinner here this evening and the food could've not been more perfect. I made extra room in my tummy to finish my entree' and that doesn't happen much at Italian restaurants, but I just couldn't stop eating.They absolutely deserve 5 stars based on the deliciousness and freshness of the food. However, due to the service and the cramped seating space, they generously get 2 stars. My girlfriend and I ordered: 2 glasses of wine (each) Some amazing bruschetta app to share A chicken, mozzarella prosciutto tomato pasta entree (each) And what was supposed to be 2 Tiramasu's (one each, but our waitress mistakenly only brought us one, so we shared...which was fine, but the point being is we ordered 2) which woul"
"An absolutely delightful experience. This restaurant restored my belief in customer service. I had an interesting experience. I was served the wrong starter twice. After the third try, we got it right. Gracious service and the Beet Soup was lovely. I had the Veal Paprikash and it was well prepared and delicious. A very limited wine list, but the owner found me a nice dry riesling that was floral and superb for the price.The service was entertaining. It was apparent that the owner loves his work. I felt very welcomed and the atmosphere is really nice and CLEAN."
I'm just a pig so I love this place. It is a place that you never not buy something. You walk out with a bag everytime. Even if you think you won't. You are lying to yourself. Just be a pig and buy the whole damn CAKE!??
this place rocks. ��100%. and I know good sushi when I get it. ��the only downfall is that its not near my house. ��they should open another location in old town :)
"I was lucky enough to get a groupon for brazzaz, which worked out perfect because it was a restaurant that my husband wanted to go to for his b-day!Anyways, we got dressed up (not required but it was fun!) and we went to the restaurant. When we pulled up, we noticed that there was valet. BUT in the same building, not more then 20 feet away was a parking garage. why pay their fees and tip when I can park my own car...however...I must warn anyone who decides to park their car in there, or let them park your car....be aware of crazy valet drivers. because one hit my husband as he whipped around the corner in someones brand new lincoln town-car. he made a sudden stop and didn't hit my husband hard, but they definitely made contact. i was frozen in shock. i couldn't believe what i just witnesse"
The Mushroom & Sausage Pizza was ��absolutely fanstastic!!!
"Crisp. Great wings, relaxed atmosphere, and to die for Seoul Sassy sauce. The only negative thing about this place is when you walk in and get a to-go order there is no where for you to stand. Everywhere you walk you get in someone's way. The foodie special sandwich is also a real winner. I have not tried their bowls yet because I am hooked on the wings. Very relaxed staff that works there."
"totally 'meh.' ��went with a friend that was in town, and we were underwhelmed. ��the menu itself leaves a lot to be desired. ��they claim to be 'farm friendly cuisine.' ��but there was maybe 5 vegetables on the menu, and besides pasta, none of them present in the main dishes.nothing really original.. ��while the meatballs had good flavor, they were completely burnt. ��i would suggest going there just for drinks and skipping food. ��seems like its trying very hard to be trendy and a 'hot spot' but totally misses the mark."
"Piece has my favorite pizza in the city, their margherita pizza with fresh basil, and their chocolate dessert pizza are amazing! ��The pizza always seems like it is made with fresh ingredients and is never too greasy, I love the texture of the thin crust here too. ��It is a great atmosphere for watching a sports game, and the beers brewed in house are a nice change from what you find at every other bar. ��I am a big fan of their wheat beer in particular."
"Omg...I'm surprised to see how many good reviews this place has. ��It is by far...THE WORSE PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. ��Especially, customer service. ��if you have about 2 hours to kill for brunch, over the top prices, and bad customer service, then Nana's would be your ideal place. ��I literally had to wait, (after asking numerous times) 45 minutes for a menu...In my opinion, Nana's is no big whoop for me and i hope that they don't stay in our neighborhood long..THEY SUCK! ��thanks.By the way...I had to give them a star. :( ��Yelp, post a thumbs down button or something!"
"Duck. Fat. Fries. Nuff said. Love this place- friendly staff, low prices, and fantastic food. Cash only and time it right- lines are around the block most of the day."
"Walking in to this restaurant you know you're in for a very upscale experience. The decor and ambiance is clean and modern but not cold.We were told to make sure we ate upstairs only because of the noise factor in the bar area. Noise is great for a high energy evening but we planned ��a family dinner with alot of talking.The service was extremely prompt and attentive. The tables were sizable and it was nice not to feel crowded in for a change.We had the HUGEST shrimp appetizers which reminded us of the shrimp cocktails from the Beetlejuice movie. Remember?Chopped salad was remarkably fresh with a balsamic dressing that was perfect and not overbearing.Steak was the entree for most. The bone in ribeye was good, not great. But the petite filet was outstanding. The sides were nice and plentiful"
"Simply It simply is it. - or at least where it's at. ?Our food was everything we wanted it to be: fresh, flavorful, delicate for the palate yet substantial for the belly. ?We started with the Grilled Lemongrass Beef as an appetizer. ?I wasn't exactly sure what to expect - but we ended up essentially making our own spring rolls. ?They were delicious - especially the dipping sauce which was light and sweet (you could taste a little sugar and hint of fish sauce), and fun to assemble. ?Definitely plenty for two or three to share.I had Pho for dinner which wasn't the absolute best I'd ever had, but it was definitely good. ?My friend had the short ribs which were truly amazing. ?I mean - best short ribs I'd ever tasted. ?So juicy and light in flavor. ?You could tell they had been marinated for a"
"I have never been to fondue before and it actually is pretty fun espcecially with a fun group of friends. Everything was pretty delicious, its a pre-fixe menu, and ofcourse do not forget to have the desert.... chocolate fondue I think I would come back for that alone!"
"I am a huge fan of Simply It. ��I have never actually eaten inside of the restaurant but have ordered delivery plenty of times. ��They are very fast and the food is always fresh and top quality. ��I love eating a lot of their beef dishes with a side of white rice. The tasty and tangy tastes of the restaurant are 'simply' perfect. ��If you are craving some sweet Asian, Thai, or Vietnamese, or for some delicious beef i encourage you to try Simply It. ��It is really good and I am writing this review just to get people to eat there, would be a shame if such a great spot closed"
"To hell with this place! ?The dark haired hostess that met us at the door on March 23rd at 11pm was a complete bitch! ?I'm telling everyone I know to avoid this place. ?She was rude, unaccommodating, and had a completely shitty attitude. ?Owner, if you read your reviews, take this one seriously! ?That one member of your staff is going to be your downfall. I brought a large group to drink and eat. ?We were clear that we understood that we wouldn't all sit together. ?We said that any accommodation was fine. ?She was hung up on the number of guests we were bringing. ?We said between 10 and 12. ?She literally yelled at us for not knowing. ?I said we would be willing to take whatever bar seating shows up and if any DR seating is available she could seat part of our group there. ?Many of these p"
Yum! Went for breakfast and they have the best menu ever. Awesome pancakes and fun atmosphere! Will definately go back!! Thanks Bongo Room! ;-)
"I love Mia Francesca and have been going to this restaurant since it opened. I have celebrated many special occasions over the years at Mia - everything has always been outstanding.However, this past Saturday, we made a reservation for 6 people at 8:30 to entertain friends from out of town. We arrived on time and were informed that it would be a few minutes until a table was ready due to several tables not turning over.After 45 minutes past our reservation, there was still no table available. All we were told was that our table was finished but wasn't leaving and they could not tell us when we would be seated, nor did they make any efforts to offer us a round of drinks or any other accomodation.There is simply no excuse to not honor a reservation after 45 minutes or to find some other way "
"This restaurant is amazing! If you truly love red meat and haven't been to a Brazilian steakhouse, you've got ��to try one. Positive: The filet mignon is to die for! And then the filet mignon wrapped in bacon was even better! The service is outstanding. The guys (gauchos) serving the charred and seasoned meat have cuts ranging from medium rare to well done. If the cut of meat you want isn't available on that skewer, they'll get it for you. If you want your steak (on the stick) cooked longer, just ask! The chicken was surprisingly great too. They have 15 different cuts of meat. The ribs are OK. The pork and lamb are above average. The top and bottom sirloin is tasty. The pichanha (steak) is very good, but the filet is where it's at! The cheese rolls that come with dinner are very good.Negati"
"So I have to say that I registered just so I could review this restaurant. �� As I started looking through reviews, I realized that I am not the only one who is pissed about the treatment by the management. ��Not only did our reservation get rudely and inconsiderately cancelled an hour before our reservations, but two of my friends had the same experience independently ��the subsequent weekend. ��The worst and most pathetic thing is that the management keeps coming up with ridiculous excuses for cancellations. ��I didn't realize the complete disregard that the restaurant has for their patrons. ��There are plenty of good restaurants in Chicago on the same level so there is absolutely no need to try to go to this one. ��I am certainly never coming there after knowing what I know."
"I think this may be the best organic food in Chicago. The dishes are unique and very flavorful. The service is just right, and the atmosphere is also very nice. This is a great place for brunch. Eat here and feel good about yourself!"
What Chciago needs is another cupcake!
I have been going to Sabatino`s for over 5 years and it`s still best Italian restaurant. Great service and atmosphere. Delicious food.
"You know, as I read these reviews, I see the same comments. ��Good pizza, but terrible service. ��My Husband and I took a weekend to relax downtown and we were on a mission to find the best deep dish. ��The pizza was great (probably the best), but the service was the worst we had since our visit. ��We are excellent tippers, considering we've waited tables all throughout school, but this was the first time we left $1 for a tip. ��When we told the manager about it, he said ""I'm sorry, Daniel is having a bad day."" ��WOW!! This is not a time to be treating people as ""business as usual."" ��I suggest the owner get a new staff and manager."
Don't order ketchup and it's called a Super Dawg!
"After trekking out here on a rainy Sat afternoon expecting something pretty decent I was amazed to be handed a very average Chicago dog and fries in a little box. On the other hand, the shake was pretty good."
"This place is legit. Nice, clean restaurant with great food. I like all Indian but I especially enjoy the kabob varieties from the tandor, their vegetarian dishes and of course the lunch buffet. Their breads are amazing and the mango kulfi is always good."
"Don't get me wrong, Irazu is a wonderful restaurant that serves delicious goodness, but you won't find more than a few of their menu items in Costa Rica :OA typical Costa Rican menu will have gallo pinto with eggs and plantains for breakfast (AND not OR as they do in Irazu), gallo pinto or rice&beans with skirt stake, fish, pork chops, chicken, or even canned tuna for lunch and dinner. ��You won't find spicy stuff like salsa or hot sauce unless you find the only Mexican restaurant in San Jos��, which, by the way, is a Tex-Mex restaurant started by someone who moved there from the States. ��I wish their chefs would educate Ticos on the Irazu style of Pura Vida ;)Irazu is best in the Summer because: BYOB and great outdoor seating."
"nice place, will go again"
You can count on yolk anytime you are in the south loop and need a great place to eat breakfast. ��They have many items to choose from and also healthy options as well. ��The service is always top notch. ��Very friendly staff. ��We are always taken care of when we go there! ��Keep up the good work!
"My brother, his girlfriend and I eluded the apocalyptic storms last night - tried to walk into Coobah's on Southport and they turned us away due to flooding. They did suggest we try Cafe 28 if we truly wanted Spanish cuisine and I am so glad they did!When we parked I realized I live down the street from this place and I had never noticed it before. I was a little weary of it when we first walked up because it was so dark. ��We walked in around 9 p.m., feeling sheepish about wanting a table so late. We first got turned away, but we explained our adventure to get there and they graciously sat us. The ambiance was beautiful. Great music, not too loud. The art was phenomenal, colorful, but not overwhelming.We split two appetizers, the baked goat cheese (the added spicy tomatoes were perfect) an"
I use to love this place but the quality of food has changed..
"This place is great...especially if you are staying at the hotel. ��The cheese bar is fun to sit at, but the service is super slow."
"My glass of OJ was $7. This is the most outrageous thing I have ever encountered. Service wasn't bad considering the waitress told me in front of all my buddies that she didn't want me paying the bill because she was not confident that I could tip her well enough considering that I was outraged by the price of my OJ. I had the Huevos Racheros. If you don't know how to make a Mexican dish, then don't put it on your menu!"
"2 words. F*@!$%*& rad. If you don't like interesting food go down the street and get some pizza and quit your bitchin. The chef is outstanding with how he puts things together. I have been in this place 5-6 times and everytime have a totally unique experience with his food. Favs: PORK BELLY crispy on the outside really tender and any prep they have for it is perfect and well worth the $22. Scallops melt in your mouth, get freaky and try the duck testicles they're rad, agnolotti super tasty, wonderfully put together cocktails... their old fashioned is the best I've ever had and I don't even like whiskey all that much, dark and stormy, and whatever the one is with the housemade blueberry syrup.They also keep the kitchen open late even on Sundays - we ate on a Sunday at midnight. One of the b"
"Exquisite food, drinks, and atmosphere. ��Great spot for a business lunch or an evening out. ��Would definitely recommend Sunda as a great dining spot."
"I've been here a handful of times. It has a New York style restaurant feel with the shared tables. The atmosphere is always lively with tons of people. Reservations are hard to get for the weekends; for walk-ins they have a lounge area in the front of the restaurant where the wait time is less. Upon first looking at their menu the variety of food is all over the place so I wasn't sure if it would be good. We had the ""No you didn't...the ultimate handroll"" it was a little spicy but had a great taste and good combination. I had the chilean sea bass and we also ordered the duck. Both entrees were great! I wasn't too impressed with their drinks (maybe we just had a bad bartender) I ordered a simple kettle tonic and it wasn't great. Overall a good place but the atmosphere is really what makes i"
"Wow, I just moved to Chicago from Miami and I was having a hard time finding a good cuban restaurant. Last week, however, I was on the bus reading the RED EYE and there it was, 90 Miles! I gathered a few friends to introduce them to my native cuisine. The moment we walked in we were greeted by the owner Alberto, pouring Cuban Cafe to any body that reached for it. I must ��say, the experience that followed was amazing. The lechon was season to perfection and trust me I know; it is ��my favorite dish! I felt like I was back in Miami but only cooler. As for my friend, I suggested for them to have the Cubano, Ropa Vieja, and the steak sandwich, we also ordered empanadas and tamales cubanos. This place is what Cuban food and hospitality is all about!!! Great job 90Miles!!"
No more Kumas forever.Lockdown tattoo.
"I went here for my birthday recently and this place was pretty crowded on a Tuesday night. ��For a really nice restaurant, I didn't like how the tables were so close together. ��It seems like this was a intimate restaurant, but then you look a foot away and there's your next door eating neighbor. It's super dark in there, our waitress had to take out her flash light to show us what we were eating. ��Enough about the ambiance though. ��The food was all in all, really great. ��We got the sampler seafood appetizer tower and it was amazing. We got the bone in filet and the recommended sea bass - both which were cooked to perfection. ��To top it off was an amazing finale of the house butter cake a la mode - OH WOW! ~ but let's just say that with high quality food and flavor comes a high quality bill."
"Crazy busy at night, but there's a good reason and we had major success when we went in the afternoon (yes, we went out of our way to visit on multiple afternoons... it was that good.)Food = Yum.Drink = Even better."
"I loved their crabcake sandwich. ��This is a very cute breadfast and lunch place. ��Very cozy and informal. ��I also their carrot cake which is pretty good. ��Overall, I really like this place a lot."
not to shabby. real indian food for a really good price. the service is good too
"I love Grand Lux, but I just can't ever seem to find a good time to go here because it's ALWAYS crowded. ��However, when I do have enough patience to wait for a table (which isn't often) I'm very happy with the food choices...everything is very good (especially the salads) and the portions are absolutely huge!"
"I am for sure the pickiest eater in Chicago.My fiance looked on yelp for a mexican place to eat tonight, he picked Mayan Palace and I had low expectations for a random mexican place in Lincoln Park. I thought it would be heavy and greasy and quick and I'd leave stuffed and feeling gross... BUT!!!This is the best mexican place I've ever visited! My fiance is a total food snob, KNOWS mexican food, and he loved it too. We were greeted right at the door by the friendliest wait staff who asked our names and sat us immediately. Also, the tables aren't loaded with extra stuff (ads, plates, etc... I hate sitting down to an already crowded table!). It is truly a place where you feel like they WANT your business, they are there to provide great service and great food.The food is light (I had quesadi"
"Loved it! Loved it! loved it! Everyone had a different menu item and each was as full of flavors as the next. If it was steak, it was cooked perfectly. The chicken was tender with a hint of rosemary. Salad was good. The Chops were almost sweet as the juices melted the meat on your tongue. Even the pasta was fabulous. If the menu said it was served with prosciutto and red pepper cream sauce, that's exactly what I tasted. Wild mushroom risotto was great, which can be difficult to execute without going to starch or mush. ��Mr Kinzie (Raphael) was fabulous, helpful, utterly attentive and funny. I go out for the desserts and I don't care who knows it. ��I had creme brulee because I always have creme brulee and can spot a good one instantly. Yep. The Chocolate terrine was exactly what they said an"
I just wasn't very impressed with what I ordered here. ��There are other restaurants in the Andersonville area that offer much better food.
"I lost respect for the Travel Channels 101 Tastiest. I drove 8 miles out of my way to try this dawg and wasted gas. It's not worth the time or effort. Pull into any hot dog stand and get the same thing or better with more options and better service. Service sucked. Black lady at walk up window did not say hi, bye or kma. I thanked her for taking my money! Don't waste your time on this one."
I eat at this place every time I'm in Chicago and they never disappoint. We always eat in the bar. The service is top notch. The crab cakes kick butt and the the lobster bisque will make your toes curl. �� ��Eat here and thank me later.
I've been eating at this place since before the rehab...ten years maybe? ��Great food. ��Great service. ��The kifta kabobs are outstanding!
all i have to say is BEST MEXICAN EVER!!!!! STEAK BURRITO OR CHIMMICANGA CHIPS SALSA!!!!!! WOOOHOOO
"I ate at the Kinzie Chophouse about a week ago and I was not impressed. I couldn't help the feeling that I had just paid $40 for a $15 steak. The food tastes cheap for what you are paying. I got the distinct impression that this was a suburban chain steakhouse masquerading as a fine urban dinning destination. It needs to realize its place in the world. The menu is ridiculous and makes a mockery of anyone who is willing to pay these prices for this quality of food. And there lies the problem. I would guess that ownership feels it is in their best interests to buy inferior ingredients, markup the price, and pocket the savings. The only reason I'm not giving this a one star review is because the service was excellent. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and extremely helpful. The entire res"
So delicious! Enjoyed a great sporty atmosphere and really good pizza! Lots of different selections. It is definately worth a try and located in a great area!
Love this place! Delicious cakes and pastries!
"My husband and I went to Vietnam last summer and we thought it was so great and the food was spectacular. ��We used to live in Texas and the Vietnamese food there was pretty decent. We now do live in Chicago and had some friends who recommended Simply It to us. I figured it wouldn't hurt to try it.We came in Saturday night and there was such a large crowd of people waiting for tables. We actually had reservations for a group of 6 but did have to wait for 20 minutes. I really didn't mind the wait. The owner was very nice. He had gave out appetizers, water, and tea to everyone who were waiting on tables.The place was crowded, I mean crowded. Chairs were touching almost back to back and certain spots you would have to squeeze to get through, like going to the bathroom. But, we all still enjoye"
"I would not recommend this place unless you carry out and know what Ethiopian dishes you like.The service was ridiculously slow. ��It was only two of us, my girlfriend and I. ��The waitress sat us outside. ��It looked like it was about to rain but we figured if it did we would move inside. ��While waiting to put in our drink order some transient approached us in the enclosed patio dining area and asked for money.We were at the restaurant for two hours! ��Two other tables got up and left after getting only water because the service was so slow. ��We ordered one appetizer and one main dish. ��The waitress forgot to bring me a beer that I ordered and almost never checked on our water glasses. ��I asked another waitress to get the beer since ours had disappeared. ��When the bill came I paid it. ��Howeve"
"Our favorite Sushi joint in Chicago.Great place to bring your friends that do not like Sushi because their Thai Food is amazing.Like EEL? ��I recommend their ""Catapillar"" and ""Popeye"".And they're incredibly friendly. ��One night while we were there with friends drinking. ��They asked to ""Vacuum around us if that's okay?"". ��Then we looked at our watches... they had been closed for an hour but they were still cool with us being there. ��So sweet!"
Very good food...
What a great restaurant. ��Taken here by my girlfriend who know Lincoln Park and was not disappointed. ��The service was excellent and the fondue concept is fun and timeless. ��The kind of plice I think I will be visiting for years to come with my wife.
"If you want Pho then Go!!!!! Absolutly the best Pho I have ever had!! It is one of those addicive foods that make you crave, crave and crave .. So what do I do?? Go back for more! I have also tried other things on their ever so large menu and they were all grate! Service is Outstanding as always! I like the camolflage shirts they wear so fitting for a restaurant named Tank! When you arrive there you will knotice everyone working very hard as they are ALWAYS busy (Number one indicator of a truely Good restaurant). Expect to sit with other guests which is not all that bad, I actually enjoy it,when i go alone I dont feel as lonely anymore. ��Go get some Pho and then you'll know!!!"
"Sunda is a great place to go for great sushi and a fun atmosphere. My friend and I showed up without a reservation and were seated in less than 10 minutes, at a communal table. The stools were a little uncomfortable, but the great food made up for it and the atmosphere of the communal table was so fun!"
"I told my friends that I wanted to try a different neighborhood other than Wicker Park, but then we stumbled upon this bar. I really liked it! Reasonably priced, great burger, and friendly staff. See you soon fifty/50."
"I have been going to that place for 6 years now! In my opinion,the best korean bbq in town! We go there with family and friends from Chicago,as well as with extended family from abroad. It is one of the must try's of Chicago. I admit, they can get quite busy and then the service suffers a bit but usually they are able to accomodate your needs of extra sauce or napkin etc. 5 stars all the way!"
"Basically good food, small to medium tasting portions and great service. ��We had the tasting menu without the wine pairings since we had cravings for mojitos. ��The traditional mojito is the best, but we also had pineapple and watermelon. ��Most popular but very limited in taste, stick with the traditional.The padron peppers were perfect, so was the head-on shrimp, date wrapped in bacon interesting (the almond in the center, a nice surprise).Patatas bravas, different try to eat them around the edges since it was very hot (temp) inside. ��I don't know if it was shaped with mash potatoes, but the sauce was not hot enough for my taste. ��Hard to do a traditional dish with a new twist and please everybody. All other appetizers were also very good, tasty with a small portions. ��After all it is a ta"
"The place is beautiful. My boyfriend and I sat by the window over looking Michigan ave. ��The service was great. ��And the food was not so good. ��I had the veal with the pasta and the veal was very dry, which nicely matched the dry pasta on the side of my plate. ��My boyfriend did enjoy his steak so I guess don't get the veal when you are there but do go for the steak!"
"I wasn't too impressed with Sunda. ��The restaurant is beautiful, which is why I think it's so expensive! ��The food, however, was average (and somewhat greasy). ��The staff had way too much attitude -- c'mon, it's only a restaurant that you're working in. ��It's hard to take a place like this seriously when there's so much authentic asian around Chicago."
"The best Mex. food and Marg. ever. ��It's small but what do you expect out of property in Lincoln Park. ��The services is great especially since they got NEW servers who are REALLY nice at heart. ��The best part about this place is, that no more smoking. ��If I had someone blowing smoke in my face I would give them an evil look. ��Hello not everybody is a smoker. ��The prices are really good as well. Don't worry people once you have Gerardo serve you, you will never miss Victor not that anybody does."
"This may be a nice place, but we never really had a chance to experience it. ��They have a policy that if everyone in your party is not eating food, you can't be seated. ��Since half of us (party of eight) had already eaten, we were not welcome there. ��They wanted the eaters to sit at a table and the others to sit at the bar! We had some munchies in the waiting area and then left. ��I had the Workingman ESB which was pedestrian, as it should be. ��Very noisy place, accentuated by the pressed tin ceiling, making it nearly impossible to have a conversation.My opinion - the beer people need to take control their establishment from the restaurant management (maybe a revolution?). ��Won't be back."
"Wow! One of the best little stumble upon restaurants you can find. ��The staff is very friendly and helpful. ��I can't wait to go back, there are so many options to try. ��They also have a great little patio in the back for fun on warm summer nights. ��Mmm friend plantains!"
"I LOVE the pizza variety! And the fact that the entire staff is unique and colorful just make it better. The prices are a little much, but it's a great place with a fantastic beer selection! Thanks for being awesome, Piece."
"Why is there a wall separating the bakery/cafe from the actual sit down area? I walked in one door to get my coffee, back through that door, and into the door next to it to sit down in an eerily quiet room. I might as well have snuck my coffee into a library. Oh, wait. Then some really annoying knitting bitches came and sat down at a table right smack in the middle of the room. I was moments away from asking them to stab me in the ear with one of their knitting needles."
"The menu seemed immpressive but didn't deliver. The service was kind of slow, but it was busy the night I was in there with a couple friends. The ambiance is cool and the patio is nice for lunch. I will probably be back to give a second try."
"Well, I'll leave out the specifics but we'll just say I've got amazing friends who've got great contacts and somehow this all worked out and I was able to dine at a place that virtually all of my others friends"
"This place is a great spot for an inexpensive date or dinner with friends. BYOB with no corking fee (yes!) and good food.I usually go for the noodles and I like their option of ""crispy"" noodles in my pad ke mao.And of course, the crab rangoon is amazing."
"I am shocked at the amount of great reviews this place gets. All that tells me is that people have no idea what real Middle Eastern food should taste like (yes, I know it varies from nation to nation, but America is not a Middle Eastern country). THIS PLACE IS NOT IT. The shawerma is bland. It doesn't have any of the flavor that real, succulent, tasty shawerma should have. The hummus also lacks flavor. The falafel isn't the best, but it is probably one of the menu items that is OK. I've been to this place a few times and the food has never been really good.The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because their catering is decent. I don't understand why, just because you are catering to an event with primarily Arab people, it is only then the food is good. It's a shame that "
"Excellent service. Loved the beets with goat cheese, loved the pork fired almonds. Vey friendly, very chic."
i was here earlier with my family and the food was delicious! the service was good too. the waitresses were not rude. they greeted us when we got in and said goodbye when we left. i will be coming here again with the rest of my family and friends.my first time coming and eating korean food. gotta say it was pretty good!con: don't like their parking lot. its so tight! this lady couldn't get her car out so i had to move my car so she could eventually leave. she scraped someone's truck and just left. my sis and i had to navigate her so she wouldn't do too much damage to other peoples cars
"I woke up this morning with a taste for Soul Food. ��Sometimes it happens. ��I guess it's cause I miss my mom, who lives in Maryland.Anywho, I didn't want to travel far, so I settled on Wishbone, which is classified as ""southern food"" which was close enough.I really wanted fried chicken, but apparently you can only get fried chicken on Wednesdays...wierd...especially for a southern place. ��So I settled on the talapia. ��I have to say, it was pretty tasty! ��For a side, I ordered greens, and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was AMAZING! ��Baked to perfection, with just the right amount of cheese. ��Greatness!Now, my friend ordered shrimp and grits, which I've never heard of (he's from South Carolina. ��They do crazy things with food there!) ��It was SO GOOOOOD! ��I'm sure I gained about 20 pounds "
"after reading all of the yelp comments about this place, I decided to try it. ��I must start off by saying that I lived in Miami for many, many years before moving to Chicago, so I'm used to having very good Cuban food. ��That said, this was just OK. ��The chicken was not as tender or well-seasoned as I would have liked. ��The maduros (sweet plaintains) were OK, but nothing to write home about. ��I also had the guava pastry. ��It was nice and flaky, but a little hard. �� Compared to what i'm used to, this was edible, but definitely not top notch."
meat meat meat...... eat eat eat...... ��thats all i have to say....my favorite place......
CLOSED!!! ��We attempted to go here on Tuesday night and it was closed by the Health Inspectors. ��I have been in the past and the food was good so we bought a Groupon for this place. ��I would not recommend going at this time until there are more details published on why the Health Inspector closed this location. ��And hopefully Groupon extends or refunds the offer!
Went with mr.Beckers class. Great service and amazing Persian and middle eastern food.
"GIgantic salads that are so good! ��I love the chopped salad and I usually try to split it with someone at my table because I can't eat the whole thing. ��But it's so good. ��I've heard that the steaks are good, and the desserts are fantastic."
"Great catering services here! I called in for catering for a party of 25 in celebration of my friend's upcoming birthday and we decided to try this place out. The man on the phone took my order, wrote it all down confirmed with me two days before and it came promptly the day of the party.All of it was unloaded off a van with brown heating boxes which tells me they care about their food keeping warm. all the guests loved the food and asked where we got the catering from. Luckily the boxes were supplied with extra to go menus. I'm happy and all the guests were happy too, additionally my wallet was kept happy! lol!"
"DELICIOUS! Everything we ordered was amazing. The milk braised pork shoulder, the fried brussels sprouts, the artichokes & fingerling potatoes and the fried olives stuffed with chorizo...wonderful.The only downside is that it's a pretty small space and it was packed! We heard everything the people sitting next to us had to say and it took a little too long in between the veggies & the meat dishes. BUT this place has a spot on my top ten list."
"This Place is Awesome.My wife and I came down town to spend the night and we decided to check this little cafe out since we were staying only a half a block away.What a surprise the food was great . Everything was fresh, very tasty with outstanding service to boot. The owner came around and asked us if we needed anythingThe prices were very reasonable and the portions very generous.We enjoyed it so much we went back in the morning to try their breakfast menu and it was just as good and our dinner the night before.What a great find. I recommend it for 10 stars. Five stars does not do it justice.Dave R. Elm wood Pk IL"
We went to Nanas on a Friday evening for dinner and the food was fabulous! ��My husband had the Gumbo special and I had the Hanger Steak. ��We also had a mushroom appetizer and shared a crumbled chocolate cake desser that was to die for! ��I would definitely go there the next time I am in Chicago.
"My Fianc��e picked the place for my Birthday dinner as I am huge RickBayless and Mexican food fan.Our experience was below our expectations, service was a disaster atbest. Our waiter was in such a hurry he did not even wanted to explainitems. My fianc��e is vegetarian and he was not able to tell us weatherstarting nuts were cooked in ��Bacon fat or not?For appetizers we had platter. and quesadilla had raw dough in them as they were not cooked properly.For the dinner we asked for Refried beans have Bacon fats or not, hewas not sure. My dinner item was ok at best and my fianc��e'svegetarian item was not even up to expectation. She ate chips andsalsa/guacamole, our waiter never came and asked whether food was ok or not.Margaritas and Guacamole? I had better margaritas in my life as I was expectin"
I've been to Nana's twice it was great the first time and even better the second time. The food is fresh and has incredible flavor. They are family friendly and a much needed addition to Bridgeport. I went with my family and my daughter order the chicken off the kids menu and it was to delicious I wanted to order some for myself I also loved that she was able to get a salad instead of fries! Even if your not from the neighborhood it's well worth the ride the food is amazing!
Midway through my meal I leaned over to my husband and whispered ?I think this is Buitoni. He countered by mentioning his gnocchi tasted processed. I make my own pasta - freeze it from time to time too. This is not handmade pasta.It's one thing to serve pasta that has been previously frozen. It's quite another thing to serve food service grade frozen pasta at a jacked up price of $20/serving. The complimentary bread was also low quality. But it is free so I'm willing to overlook. I won't overlook the main dish though. I also sort of question the cool-jazz soundtrack playing in the background. I suppose some people consider Kenny G romantic. I am not one of those people.The two stars is for the service - I have no complaints about the service.
"Gejas has, for the past 30 years that *I* know of, set the gold standard for fondue joints. ��This was a great date place in the 70s, and it remains so today. ��They don't mess with success. ��With the exception of the prices, I think the menu has pretty much stayed the same since then too. ��So, if you loved the cheese and chocolate fondue in those golden long ago days, you're going to love them now. ��But it's a lot more crowded nowadays, and, as I say, the prices sure aren't what they used to be.So, go, and have fun!"
"If you are in Lakeview andwant a quick bite to eat, I recommend the Foodie's Choice Crisp, the best chicken sandwich I've ever had."
"I went to Bin 36 because a close friend of mine's son recommended it to me. ��I was taken immediately by the friendly professional staff and there comprehensive knowledge of the wine list. �� As a man who has been to few countries and more than one wine bar, they have a fair wine list. ��This is a compliment. ��The staff actually could speak intelligently about the wines they have and the wines they have were all reasonably priced. ��Nothing outrageous nor out of place. ��Good wines for a good value. ��I strongly recommend this to anyone and I will be back. ��Thanks for the good time and the excellent service.Frank"
I would eat here everyday if I could. Anyone giving this place below a 3 star review is completely nuts.
one of the best restaurant in town. The bouillabaisse is fantastic.Highly recommended.
"Want a falafel, don't go anywhere else. This is the place!"
I love that place.I have been coming here for last 3 years and the food is always so delicious and the staff is super friendly!!!
"Upon stumbling past the old Tsunami restaurant, I discovered Chicago Q; a contemporary finer dining BBQ restaurant. I first thought, I will come back,but decided to venture in. I found not only the staff to be extremely attentive, but absolutely found the food to be phenomenal. Get this........Honey buttered cornbread, Kobe baked beans, St Louis Ribs, etc. This restaurant is moderately priced for what you are getting. They make their own sauces and am just in love. In addition, they have a remarkable whisky list and make delicious Mohitos. Highly recommended. Food and atmosphere is superb."
"I work in the area, and 90 Miles is one of my guilty pleasures. Media Noche is great, definitely try the Ropa Vieja too. ��Do not pass up their cafe con leche. Service takes forever and a day, but ��it's amazing and imo well worth it."
"I came here for the first time for lunch during the workday. ��I called ahead and they said 8 people wouldn't be a problem. ��During the week before 2pm you serve yourself at the counter and don't really have to wait a long time to get any food. Many of the choices are point and receive style along the line. ��20 minutes for a Chicken Kebab to cook up for lunch which isn't bad at all. Artopita with Mushroom and Emmenthal was the right amount of flaky pastry, small mushroom pieces and cheese that melted and ran out of the side as you cut into it. ��The lunch came with a pasta salad to accompany. ��On an Hour Lunch time schedule along the west loop it's perfect to stop by after finding parking which can be dodgy here and there during the rush of lunch time. Go between 1-2pm if you want to get in "
"I went here last Friday 12/12/08 and really enjoyed the food. I ordered the Ropa Vieja appetizer which was the perfect balance between sweet and savory: sweet plantains, braised beef, spicy mayo, queso fresco. Everyone at the table tried this and loved it. For my entree I ordered the Churrasco -Nicaraguan style wood-grilled beef tenderloin which was also delicious. What I loved the most: The flavors were unique and delicious!What I liked the least: The noise--this restaurant is loud."
"The salad bar is loaded with MSG. ��I was dying of thirst driving home. ��My husband experienced a rapid heartbeat, which is a side-effect of MSG. ��It is too expensive to eat and then to feel lousy afterwards. ��We did not eat any of the meat, shrimp, or pineapple."
"My friends told me about this joint and I am glad they did.Food is pretty good,fair portions,from what I can tell visiting other Cuban restaurants,pretty authentic.Great place for quick lunch.The restaurant is pretty small,forget about sitting down during the busy lunch hour.Get it to go!"
"This place is so overrated. They deep fry everything, service is rude at best, they think they rule the costa rican world..but thats easy i guess when you are the only costa rica"
"Sad to say, it's gone downhill big time since they remodeled. I don't get it...did they hire all new cooks? is it different management that just doesn't care? ��I used to love their burritos and tortas here so so much. Garcia's was an institution. ��me and my girlfriend both loved the place, were regulars. However, We've been there twice in the last few months since they re-opened and our dinners were just awful. On both occasions the meat was burnt and unedible in our dishes. On the last occasion my Al Pastor Torta was so burnt, there was no flavor beyond the burnt meat itself. Charred to a charcoal back, all the meat. How could they serve that? the first time we were disappointed, but we wanted to give them another chance, but when that happens twice in a row, something's wrong. We won't b"
"I just had a very delicious experience at Chicago q. The d��cor of q has a modern country feel. The walls and ceiling are white detailed wood. The floors are wide planked with a medium stain and the tables are dark which serve to create a nice contrast in a very inviting way.The service is wonderful. The wait staff is very attentive and easy going in this gourmet BBQ restaurant. Instead of the automatic boring basket of bread before the meal that most restaurants serve, we were served intriguing sweet pickles and seasoned potato chips. That was a pleasant surprise. The artful presentation of the food goes against the traditional sloppy style expectations of a BBQ experience. Though each member of my dining group ordered his/her own items off the menu, we all tasted everything. So here is my"
This place is great. ��Good sushi selection and always fresh.
This place is great. One of the first bars in the city to show the UFC fights. Being a big fan of the UFC brought me in and the service and food kept me coming back. Gets real crowded before the fights so you have to get there an hour early if you want a seat. Love it though. I think about the skirt steak sandwhich all day.
"This restaurant is so overrated that it is laughable!!! My friend and I went there last night and first of all the service was horrible. ?The bus boy (teenager) slung the water in the glasses and plopped the bread on the table. ?Then after about 20mins I had to get up from my table and ask this same disinterested bus boy if there was an actual waitress. ?When the waitress finally does come over she too is less than customer focused. ?We had to ask her about the specials of the evening. ?Eventually, two salads are placed in front of us that had lettuce on them that was older than the homeless guy's underwear standing on the corner. ?I had the Spinach Ravioli Gorgonzola Pesto Sauce it was okay more pesto than ravioli's. ?My friend had the Fettuccini A Mare Chiaro it was soup and the calamari"
"SO this review was removed but here it is again . THIS IS A TRUE STORY!!!BAD MANAGEMENT! read onOk So I tried out the purple pig due to recommendations from friends . I had read mixed reviews on yelp but we thought we'd give it a shot . I never made it to a table ! I went in with a group of friends . We were told the wait was going to be about 45 minutes which is understandable in a place that doesn't take reservations . I'Ve waited two hours to eat at Frontera and it was amazing , so needless to say the wait doesn't bother me if the food is good. The problem here is that I never was able to try the food because I would not support this place after the conversation I had with the manger . First off he was rude . He just came off as curt and seemed disinterested in helping a group of young "
"my favorite of all the deep-dishes!not fancy at all, but you can stop in for a slice, and with the larger space, sit with friends while you eat."
"This place is one of my favoriate places to dine in the city. ��I've been here twice now and I will go back again. ��The food is outstanding, it's the best Mexican food in Chi Town. ��I highly recommend Frontera Grill. ��The prices are good and the wait staff is very friendly. ��Also, they are constantly changing the menu. ��The flavors in the food definately stand out."
Love the pizza. Love the beer. Love the vibe.Great to come here with friends. Brought my parents here on my first visit and it was too loud for them.
"OMG! ?YUMMY on the Sunday Brunch! This was our last meal in Chicago before heading back to Mississippi. It was the BEST brunch I have ever had in my life. I am 52 years young, and have eaten at a lot of nice restaurants for Brunch. We started with a bloody mary then we hit the cold bar. We opted for the oysters on the half shell, ceviche, and a king crab cantaloupe mixture served in a champagne glass. Sounds weird but it was FAB! ?Next we had the lobster bisque, king crab with drawn butter, and huge fried shrimp. If you want breakfast fare, they have it but we weren't wasting our stomach fill space with eggs, omelets and bacon. Lastly we managed to hit the dessert room. Yes, I said ROOM. The little raspberry tarts were scrumptious. This spread is only $39/each. I don't know how they make m"
"My favorite place to grab a bite in the neighborhood. Usually my boyfriend and I go and get 1 order of Seoul Sassy wings and 1 Seoul Sensation burrito to share both and sometimes we still have leftovers. The first time I had Seoul Sassy wings spoiled me for life--I will never love any chicken dish as much as I love that. I love my fried chicken, but that takes it to a whole new level. YUM!!! The burrito is bursting with the freshest ingredients. If I go alone, I can eat half the burrito and have the next half the next day--lot of bang for your buck. Good prices, friendly service, clean place, best food--can't go wrong."
"The best seafood in Chicago! They have the best cape scallops when they are in season! This restaurant is definitely worth the relatively steep prices. There are two sides to this massive ?restaurant, a fine dining room, and a more relaxed oyster bar where there is live jazz three days a week."
"I went with 2 friends who I haven't seen in years and we were just catching up for a bit and did not want to order quite yet, but our server was very pushy and seemed annoyed with us. He came around after we said we needed more time and just gave us even more attitude. We all work in the industry, 2 of which are from Vegas and work in clubs and bars, and we were completely taken back by this service. He took our order and only came back once we were finished and try to to be all friendly when asking if we wanted dessert. Seriously dude? Could you not tell how we were not happy what so ever.Moving on, the food was amazing. And that is why I had to give it one star....otherwise I would have given it zero if I could. Love the sushi it was the only thing that kept me from not complaining.I wan"
After approaching Zed to organize a charity event for 200-300 people one of the managers set up a meeting with the regional manager Tim to discuss the details of what we would like to set up. I had a bad feeling about the meeting when the manager didn't even bother to come up to meet with us for 20 minutes after the meeting was scheduled to begin. The event we were organizing was to benefit under privileged youth of the west side of Chicago sponsored by 4 of the most notable tech firms in the world. During the meeting Tim mentioned that they had recently totally screwed up an event for one of these very companies and thought that our event would be a way to make up for that. During the discussion we gave various dates that would work for us and what we were looking for from Zed. After the 
"not the very best of southern cuisine, but really good for chicago.salads are huge, side salad for dinner could have fed another person easily. ��shrimp&grits: grits a little thick, but tasso ham gravy was spot on.comparing this place to restaurants in Columbia SC, Myrtle Beach, SC, Greenville NC and Hilton Head, it compares pretty well. ��server was attentive, but s-l-o-w-p-a-c-e-d. ��go with people who talk a lot or alone and read a book, you won't notice as much."
"I see that the reviews for Caro Mio are predominantly positive, and the reputation of this little Lincoln Square pasta joint is in fact the reason I decided to go there last night. Pasta is usually something I pass on when putting my money down for a dinner out because I've unfortunately not had to many pasta restaurant pasta dishes I couldn't have done better at home. My overall experience here was not bad, but not good either. Kind of blah. So so. The dishes here were definitely slapped together to entice the weekend crowd, loaded down with not-quite-right and much-to-much combinations of keyword ingredients like sun dried tomatos, pesto cream sauce, and what seemed like just the ends of things the chef was trying to get rid of. Portions here were out of control too. My partner and I lef"
"2 stars, plain and simple. ��I just don't feel the experience was worth the money spent that's all. ��I mean the pizza doesn't taste bad or anything. ��In fact I'd say it's fair but I think that other places like Congress or John's provide a better pizzeria experience for a cost that is similar if not slightly less. ��This place is more of a bar than anything. ��Their service at the bar isn't bad but you better bring a wad of cash if you want to drink here. ��Overall there's better pizza and there's cheaper bars with just as much eye candy."
"I do have to say,Every girl that works hereis a TOTAL bitch."
"I went to this place on Friday because a friend recommended it and I had seen it on Check Please! several weeks ago. ?Boy was this a bad recommendation. ?First, I LOVE middle east food. ?I got the veg dinner and it was mediocre, at best. ?Second, some of the staff could not have been less helpful or downright rude. ?We waited fifteen minutes to pay for our food. ?The boss was someplace else and was the only one with access to the cash register. ?Finally one of the guys behind the counter started taking money and making change out of the tip jar!!! ?This place is in dire need of a worker's revolt. ?The management here is clearly incompetent. ?I will never go back."
I will never go back there because of BAD SERVICE!! sorry to write this review.
"This place is great!! It was our first anniversary and the staff couldn't have been better. We had a nine o'clock reservation, but when we showed up we were told there was going to be a bit of a wait. We weren't thrilled about this, but the hostess offered us drinks while we waited. 45 minutes later, while enjoying the music from the piano bar in the background, we were seated.The dining room is dim, very romantic. The wait staff wears white jackets. We had two servers who went into detail about the menu. We ordered the bone-in ribeye and the swordfish. OMG... they both were so good. Even the bread basket was good. We shared a side of gorgonzola mac and cheese...Yum!!!The servers surprised us with two glasses of dessert wine and the most fabulous, flavorful white cake with cream cheese cen"
"We gave the Indie Cafe a shot a while ago and rarely go anywhere else for sushi. ��The food is awesome.For those who do not want to spend a lot of money on sushi... you can easily order sushi AND thai for a great price. ��Their chicken fried rice is delicious. I also enjoy their Popeye sushi.Also, the wait staff is soooo friendly. ��For example, one night we were there after they closed with friends. ��They came up to us and said ""would you mind if we vacuumed around you?"". ��They didn't want us to leave, they saw we were having a great time. ��That was very sweet of them.We love you Indie Cafe!"
"Good food but service needs to learn english. when they came out with the check they waited by table till I paid, damn!! They are some money hungry mofo's. Foods good but not good enough for me to come back."
"I never write reviews, but I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Uncommon Ground, and when I saw a really nasty review written by Robert H., I felt (as an former waitress) obligated to stick up for my favorite restaurant.It actually IS a violation of health code standards to bring outside food into a restaurant. I worked in restaurants for years, and MOST chefs forbid it! When restaurants do let you bring in your own cake, it is done STRICTLY as a courtesy. It is your responsibility as a diner to call ahead and ask what their house policies are on bringing in an outside cake. And if they do allow it, you should leave extra gratuity to the server who has A. lost out on dessert sales due to your cake, and B. has to cut, plate, and serve your cake. I mean, really? Would you bring in your own steak??? Use your b"
a breakfast staple. ��great coffee.
"I wasn't impressed with this place. ��It's a knock off of the same old model around town -- beers (which i love, but didn't care for their selection) and trending offerings such a bacon fat pop corn.Wouldn't go back."
"I've watched this restaurant grow in popularity the past 8 years, and you need to go if you haven't. ?This place is a true gem in Chicago! Menu is completely different than what you expect from bar food. ?Beer selection will blow your mind."
"Must say, some of the best brunches I've ever had came from here! The lines are not so bad if you go at the right time and if you don't got yourself a car you have to stow away. The breakfast foods are fantastic! I had the Meli's french toast, and I think I still dream about it sometime. The pancakes are HUGE and the lunch portions are equally impressive. Everytime my friends and I are in Chicago and are craving a bite to eat, we always end up here. Definitely worth your time if you are willing to wait in line for a bit (my only compliant) on the busy times on weekends."
"I called in an told them I was proposing to my girlfriend later in the evening. They gave us fantastic seats and treated us really well. The food was great, and the place is pretty romantic. I plan on going back for our anniversary. The only problem is they didn't have bacon on the menu. NO BACON? CMON. do I really have to sneak it in under my coat?"
"Overall a good experience. ��It's a quaint little spot - we've been there before and will go again. ��Get there early as no reservations for parties of fewer than six people. ��We gave them our name and cell phone number and he called when the table was ready - I Love that! ��The food is very good, although we couldn't quite put it in the great category. ��The very fresh bread and chopped garlic at the start of the meal was excellent. ��The waitstaff was very attentive. ��The BYOB is always a bonus so we can spend more on food. ��The tiramisu was a nice way to cap things off. ��Suggestion to Caro Mio: ��The lighting isn't nearly good enough to easily read the dessert menu - dark print on a dark background? ��Who thought that one up?"
"This is a great place. ��It has a special place in our hearts (and stomachs). ��My hubby has been going forever, and proposed to me here. ��The food is wonderful, wait staff personable and fun, and the amount of food you get is delightful... you always have enough for lunch the next day. ��I love the pizza bread that comes to the table with the water - so tasty. ��I've tried several different menu items, and love them all. ��Oh, to top off the food, there is a wonderful piano man there on Friday and Saturday! ��I'd go just to listen to him!!! ��When was the last time you heard a lounge guy able to do Frank Sinatra AND Lady GaGa? ��He does Billy Joel and Elton, Dean Martin and Sting... I know there are more, but you will just have to go see him.Yup food - fun - and entertainment... definitely a grea"
"yes yes and yes! I really enjoy this place, I have been going here for years, and its just always good food. I only one complaint that I have is that sometimes I have waited up to 2 hours to sit and eat. Why would I do that? Well cause the beer selection while waiting is worth it and so is the food. I suggest that everyone checks this place out at least once while in the city. Just go on a week night."
"Superdawg!! I absolutely love this place! I love it so much I was hesitant about writing an honest positive review! I don't want this little drive-in to get too busy; to the point I won't find a parking spot!! Although I will share the joy and spread the good news of how great Superdawgs hot dogs and burgers are! All in hope they grow and open another location soon! Superdawg has a lot of history in Chicago. The owners I have met and spoken to various times. This Drive-in only has one location which is on Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago, IL. I do not have a clue why people have posted Superdawgs location as Wheeling, IL. Anyhow...the drive-in is owned by a family. Started with the grandparents and now has 3 generations running it plus employees. To eat here you need a CAR! That's maybe a negat"
"For several years I lived a block away from the 3rd Coast, and this place was my hangout! The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with great local art hanging on the walls. The service is relaxed but intuitive and attentive, so if you need constant refills of your coffee, or maybe want to be left alone to read your paper, they're cool with either. While evrything on the menu is delicious (and the portions are large enough so that you will definitely have some to take home) -and I've had everything on the menu- one of my favorites here were the Chocolate Chip Buttermilk Pancakes. They're the ultimate comfort food, and the best I've had out of any breakfast place I've ever eaten at! I'm also a fan of the Baked Chevre, Smoked Turkey and Brie, Veggie Sandwich, 3rd Burger, and House Omlette. In ad"
"The quality of food is surprisingly good. Definetely better than your average bar and grill. The quality and selection of beer is truly impressive. The feel and ambiance of the dining room is worth the trip. Our service wasn't great but to be fair, our server was in the weeds, we understood. ��Portions were good and left us feeling as if we got good value for our money. Will go again."
"Simply It is simply delicious, affordable, and has a nice atmosphere! ��The food was flavorful and fresh. ��There were a lot of vegetarian options. ��The owner was happy to seat us quickly even though it was busy and we didn't have a reservation. ��I was with a friend who was visiting from London (though she is German by birth) and can be somewhat picky. ��She also thought the food was delicious and fresh, and was happy to get a cuisine that she can't often get in London. ��We didn't realize it was BYOB, but with no corkage fee on top of that I will definitely be back with wine in hand. ��And the complimentary fruit at the end of your meal is refreshing and a nice touch."
Went this weekend. ��Very crowded. ��The only thing that was disappointing was that we had to sit in the bar area where it was very crowded and loud even though we had reservations. ��The food was great and the steak was so tender. ��Our waitress was very nice. ��Will return.
"This was by far THEE WORST restaurant I have ever gone to. Everything from the wine ,appetizers,main course on down to the dessert was BAD and cheap and low grade. This is NOT Italian food at it's best. I doubt real Italians even own or run this establishment anymore. I know it used to be good in the 1970's and 1980's but it is NOT the same. It is in the top 5 worst restaurants that I have ever been to. I have been to many . No stars as a rating."
"We thought we were in for a nice treat at Uncommon Ground on Devon one summer Saturday. I had been the Grace Street location and always thought it was pretty nice.Not so UC on Devon. First off it has a little parking lot of its own that is almost impossible to access from the street. When I finally did get there the lot was full. Great, street parking for me. We wanted to dine outside, but they claimed there weren't any tables. We pointed out two that were unoccupied and they grudgingly wiped down a table for us.We saw our server a total of two times: once take our order and once to give us the bill. When our food was delivered we had no silverware or napkins (they were delivered later with no apology). Basically only one person checked to see how we were doing and she didn't seem to care "
"We live in Wicker Park and are long time patrons of the Alliance Bakery, but we recently had a bad experience with those amazing looking cakes in the window. Since I was completing graduate school, we decided to order something special for family that would be in town for the celebration. There was an awesome cake in the window that looked like a giant cheeseburger. Inspired, we decided to get one that looked like a deep-dish pizza. When I ordered the cake, it was much more expensive than originally quoted...over $160 for a cake that fed eight. When I picked the cake up, it was the size and dimensions of a regular cake, NOT of a deep-dish pizza, the frosting was pink instead of red like a marinara, with just a few fondant pepperonis and (gray) mushrooms. My expectations had been set by the"
"not that impressed overall... we got to the restaurant at 5:30 on a friday for dinner...the wait for a table was over an hour. just walking inside we were confused where to stand and wait for our table...finally grabbed a seat at the bar...the beers we sampled were definatley laking in taste and not acurate decriptions on the beer menu...we were expecting more from the beers, but nothing really stood out for us. Sat down at a pretty decent seat for dinner...the waitress never gave her name, our appt sucked, and our order came out wrong. it just seemed like they wanted us to eat and get out...probably wont go back. we did like the gentlemen who took our name and sat us...he was very nice and personal. Revolution Brewry seems misplaced for its location...trying to be too trendy with the food"
"I don't give out 5 stars lightly - that fifth one usually has to get pried out my cold dead fingers - but I can't avoid it with this place. It is Simply It - a great place to get exotic food at reasonable prices. 6 of us went there on a Monday eve to celebrate my wife's birthday. If I mentioned which one there would be more cold dead fingers -- so I'll let it pass. Anyway - the family made the trek to Lincoln Ave for a reserved table for 6 at 7 - and it was ready and waiting for us - with a personal hello from the owner - and let's face it - who doesn't like a personal hello from the owner. Makes you feel important. They seated and watered us quickly, took our wine and had us wined up in a matter of moments as well -then the fun started. The menu is a treat just to read. Spring rolls, temp"
"This place has some of the best burgers in the city (maybe, MAYBE, second to Kuma's, but I've never waited three hours for a table at Bad Apple, and that's gotta count for something). ��The cheese curds are awesome, the short-story-of-a beer list is comprehensive at the very least, very long with great selections, and, again, the burgers are fantastic (the Red Dragon is great, same as the Ole Imperial, served on an English muffin and delicious)."
"The food is defintely to write home about. ��The dogs come in a variety of 'spice' levels and are reasonably priced. ��the fries in duck fat are to die for and i am a huge fan of them. ��the atmosphere is very cool as wellthe reason i cant give 5 stars, is due to the WAIT. ��it is ridiculous to have to wait so long for anything. ��it feels like a ride @ Great America @ times. ��The place is always packed and can get loud and crampy as you might imagine.Overall, a great place though!"
"I had brunch here last weekend with my boyfriend and a visiting friend. ��The BF and I split the Eggs New Orleans and some special involving spaetzel and chorizo. ��The egg dish was quite good - poached eggs, crabmeat, popovers, bernaise sauce, what could be bad? ��The special . . . wasn't. ��Overall, the meal was pretty tasty but it didn't blow us away. ��I did enjoy the free beignets a lot. ��They reminded my boyfriend of the ones he had at Cafe du Monde in NOLA. ��I think we'll come back for dinner sometime. ��I also liked the decor and was really happy that they found my credit card after I blanked out and left it on the table after paying."
"I'm not really sure what all the bad reviews on here are about. ��This place is solid. ��Great food, great service. ��Better that Fogo."
busy placehuge portionshighly recommend---asian nachos
perfect everytime. doug will you marry me?
"This is my daughter's favorite restaurant. ��We love the food here, and have gone here for holidays and birthdays. ��The food is great! ��Even the salad bar is excellent!"
"Wonderful food although a little pricey. ��Loved the beets and carrots, collards, lentils and some of the meat dishes. ��A couple of the meat dishes I found a little chewy and tough. ��The vegetarian dishes though are wonderful. ��The coffee was divine!"
"First night dining during first trip to Chicago; chosen because Burnham Hotel magazine said Bon Apetit touted it as one of 10 Best New Restaurants in America; was not dissappointed.Late dining, crowded/noisy inside, opted for table outside, which turned cold because we were not close to one of the heaters; (we were able to move a little closer to a heater after other diners left). ��Great waitress, Paige, and sommelier came out and gave us recommendations for other restaurants (1) for the rest of our stay.  (We were lucky to get into (1) Schwa and already had reservations at TRU.)We liked the following the most:1.- Amazing deep fried deviled egg on a bed of perfectly dressed arugula with caper berries.2.- Again, perfectly dressed asparagus/hazelnut salad3.-Wagyu sirloin tip with summer bean"
"I want to move into this restaurant so bad. ��It is my favorite restaurant, hands down. ��I have never ordered anything off the menu that didn't make me wiggle in my seat and do jazz hands in the air because it was THAT yummy. ��The atmosphere is fantastic, the staff is always warm and feels like family. ��It seriously doesn't get any better than this folks!"
Two words: Ropa Vieja!This is one of my favorite festive food spots. Bring out of towners here for a nice night out.
The plantain & guava was great along with the empanadas. The steak was good was expecting more but that was still good. My date had seafood and did not care for it too much and ended up having some of my ��steak. Good portion and sides are tasty too
"I grew up here! ��My cousin and I would make frequent runs, dodging cars like playing a game of Frogger at N Milwaukee Ave & W Hermione St (our Grandmother lived right on W Hermione St). ��My Grandmother has passed since and the house was sold, but that does not stop me from driving all the way from Romeoville to Milwaukee & Devon!!! ��There is NO other hot dog place that can top Superdawg... EVER! ��Their shakes and malts are to die for. ��The pickled tomato is just like a cherry on top of a sundae. ��Of course, I've had everything on the menu at one point or another and everything is just awesome. ��My favorite part is the old fashion drive-in where you park, order from your menu board, then they come to your car with your food and hook the tray to your window. ��The staff is just awesome, the f"
"I had the burger and it was good. PIzza was also good. The only problem I had was with the service.This place definitely needs more servers to really take care of their customers. ��The busser was more attentive than our server. ��Oh, and this place is tooo noisy."
"My wife and I just ate here tonight, we had a reservation for 8pm on a Saturday and when we arrived a half hour early we were immediately seated with a smile. The wait staff was friendly and attentive, answered all our questions and gave great wine suggestions. ��I want to apologize in advance if I use the word amazing too often. For a first course I had a perfectly poached egg atop a bed of frisee over fried potato strings and crunchy pork belly bits all enfused with the perfect level of truffle aroma and taste, a great start!! ��Between the first and second course we were served a subtle yet amazing potato leek soup, amazing. For a second course I had the quail, perfectly cooked, rich moist meat and crispy maple skin. ��This was served atop a root vegetable hash and stuffed with a fois gras"
Food is fresh and inexpensive. And the new location is a far cry from the hole in the wall former space on Argyle which was kinda yucky.
"I've eaten plenty of hot dogs and fries in my day, but none have tasted as good as Doug's. ��And Doug is a sweetheart. ��I just wish you were open 24 hours."
"I agree with another reviewer-I love the IDEA of loving Uncommon Ground more so than I actually did. ��The ��food was fair and service unattentive. ��Fresh basil sold me on the special of the day, only to find that it arrived with no basil. �� I couldn't get the waitress' attention so I just ate it anyway. ��I love the atmosphere and event calendar, but not sure if I will return. ��The bathrooms were unacceptable."
"The waitress was so wonderful. ?She was attentive, nice, and courteous. ?The hostess was not. ?When I was leaving the restaurant, Isaid, Thank you. ?His response... Sure. ?I was astounded. ?I will not patronize the restaurant again."
"This is one of the WORST restaurants I have ever been been suffered to endure.I've been twice. ��Once I went there and ate with friends. ��The sushi was of poor quality. ��So much so that I didn't want to eat it.The second time I ordered a delivery of ��the Seafood Madness. ��Not only was it disgusting, but it totally smelled (bad) fishy and the squid/octopus was like smelly rubber.Awful."
"90 Miles is the real deal. My wife and I were looking for a place to eat outside when I remembered hearing raves about this place. The outdoor seating is perfect and the food was even better...authentic, tasty and not over priced. It's BYO so we brought a bottle of wine and the waiter brought us a delicous sangria mix...they also offer a mojito mix if you bring rum. The service was great, the portions are huge and I'll definitely be back."
"Pros: Great atmosphere, friendly hostesses, lively bar scene (though tables too packed in so no standing space), live music, good drinks, black or white napkin option, follow up call the next day by the hostess. Cons: Had a terrible waiter (Eric). He was rude and seemed put-out by any questions we asked. I ordered a filet mignon cooked medium. It arrived medium well to well done. And this was immediate, as in as soon as I cut into it I saw that it was way overcooked. Eric did not stick around to ask us if our steaks were cooked ok, which to me, is basic serving skills at a steak restaurant. 25 minutes later he finally came to check on us and I told him my steak was overdone but since everybody else was done with their entree I didn't want a new one. He actually came over to me and instead "
"First off, you'll wait in line Bubba. take that fact to the bank. it'll be worth it, trust me. second, for all you Canadians/folks from origional 6 hockey towns, Doug, the friendly proprietor displays an encylopedic knowledge of old school NHL hockey. now to the main act...The Hot Dogs are to die for - as in last meal on earth calibre. Last time i was there in November, we rolled in and doused our hangovers with the foie gras, the mountain man, the luca brassi and the traditional chicago style. the duck fat fries are a particular delight but you can only get them on Friday and Saturday. Wash it all down with a cherry cola. go now."
"Ok, first off people thinking of reviewing RATE THE PLACE ON THE EXPERIENCE ON THE INSIDE, ?NOT ON YOUR IGNORANCE OF GOING TO A SMALL SPECIFIC SPECIALTY THEMED BAR ON A PEAK WEEKEND HOUR WHERE, SUPRISE!!, YOU HAVE TO WAIT TO GET IN!!! ?Seriously people..?!?. ? ?Went on a Monday night, no wait no hassle. ?Almost missed it since the outside light was burned out and it just looked like a normal graffitied wall. ?Walked through 2 sets of heavy ass velvet curtains and around a bend where the hostess checked our i.d.'s. ?The place was scary dark! ?She had to squint over a 2 watt lamp to check them. ?Walked past the lounge area to the booth's in the other room. ? ? The place was painted a soft baby blue with white crown molding and the bar looked like they bought out the Restoration Hardwares med"
"What a disappointment! ��The only romantic part is that the place is dark; probably to hide the grease and the worn decor. ��Upon first entering the restaurant I was overtaken with the smell of cooking oil. ��I didn't think much of it since it was a fondue restaurant. ��We were seated at a tiny table for two in chairs that you would expect to find at a VFW hall in the 1970's. ��The menu seemed larger then the table itself. ��I was afraid the menu would catch fire if I read it over the table, at the same time I was wondering how our plates, the food we were to cook, the fondue pot and our glasses would fit on the table. ��Not to mention that the table next to us was less then 6 inches away. ��We did ask to sit at a booth but were denied. �� Luckily the couple seated there was pleasant and thanked us"
"Really wonderful Italian dishes! ��The asiago gnocchi was amazing--with fresh basil! ��The lasagna and veal dishes are delicious too. ��Generous portions and an extensive menu. ��The atmosphere is cozy, clean, and well-done. ��Comfortable and stylish at the same time. ��Great first date restaurant!"
"My wife and I have been regulars for weekend dinners at the India House restaurant in Downtown Chicago over the last several months, but Saturday night (1/23) we had the best experience so far in terms of Ambience and Service. We have had the opportunity to visit India a couple of times and learn the Indian Culture, and last night at India House, it brought back memories as we felt we were being welcomed back to India by a very Elegant Young Lady in Traditional Indian clothes, who was very professional and seated us at the best table available, as the place was super busy like every night. My wife and I were very impressed by her hospitality, and her warm personality. The Food has always been excellent at India House, with the wide variety of choices they have - Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb "
"If there was a negative rating system, I would use that. The valet practically pushed me out of the car, and then squeeled my tires as they pulled away. When I mentioned this to the host, they didn't seem to care. The waitstaff was pushy and rude and seemed to be preoccupied with other stuff that must have been more important than his job. The food wasn't cut very well and the seafood smelled funny(I didn't eat it for that reason). The drinks were rediculously overpriced. If you were unfortunate enough not to get a booth, you got crammed in next to complete strangers. I know that the only reason they serve fondue is because of health code violations in the past and they weren't allowed to cook food there anymore. What a joke, I will NEVER reccomend this place to anyone unless they want to "
"One of my favorite restaurants because it is so consistently good. ��Just like the Cheesecake factory, the portions are huge and great for leftovers. ��I really like the crispy caramel chicken and the buffalo chicken sandwich, and you cannot leave without getting dessert (just get the cookies as soon as you sit down) ��The breakfast here is OK, but not as good as the lunch and entrees. ��It does tend to get extremely crowded (particularly with tourists) on the weekends, but they do move people in and out fairly fast, so I have never had a ridiculous wait for a table."
"Hi end Mexican. It' smore expensive than Mexican should be. But then the food is to die for. If you are into soups, you absolutely must try. I must warn you, you may get hooked ..."
Very delicious and interesting food. My husband is a big fan of mexican cuisine.
"I had a b-day party of 15 people last night and the food was phenomenal (hot and spicy)! The waiter was great in accommodating everyone including 3 kids and making some food suggestions. The tiger cry was exceptional (like always) along with the chicken larb, tom ka kai and the pad thai noodles- outstanding flavors! Opart is the only thai restaurant we go to including the one on state street, but by far this one has better flavors and you can't beat the prices! And it's BYOB!!!!!! great savings when you're hosting a party."
"I really loved Big Jones! Everything about it was beyond my expectations after reading some of the less than kind reviews here. My husband and I along with a couple of friends went in Saturday night for dinner. We did have a reservation and were escorted to our table right away. I was a bit hesitant as the host sat us in the backroom(very small, but cozy)but was put at ease when our server greeted us and asked ""how did you guys manage to get seated in the VIP room?"" I quickly got over my slight claustrophobia and settled in nicely. We had many questions, as we were not familiar with 'Southern Coastal' cuisine and our server was not only knowledgeable, but extremely patient and kind, as we took up a lot of his time. We were told of several specials that ran out his mouth like he'd been sayi"
"Best, most affordable sushi in the neighborhood! Love the high-energy staff and menu selection. It's BYOB with no corkage fee and the specials are amazing. I go with friends all the time, but would LOVE to go on a date there(if I can ever get one!!) They deliver farther than most places would, which is awesome. I really have nothing bad to say about Coast whatsoever! I F%#@!N LOVE IT!"
"You can't go wrong with this place. Always a great fresh menu (hand-written) every week! Awesome 1/2 chicken and great appetizers too.Do yourself a favor and get there early, they are packed every single night they are open!"
"So one of the new places to be in Chicago, as a New Yorker that loves restaurants Sunda lives up to the hype. ��When we arrived it was very crowded, with a hip and good looking scene. ��One drink at the bar and seated at the sushi bar for dinner. ��Waitress was very good, knew the menu well and didn't rush us at all. ��Had a variety of different appetizers and specials, plus sushi, and everything was great. ��Tuna tataki, yellow-tail jalapeno... they do it right. ��It is a little loud but that is what I would expect in a hip, trendy, popular place. ��One of the best dining experiences I had in Chicago and cant wait to go back."
"If you want cheap, authentic Mexican Food Nuevo Leon is for you! ��And the service was fast, we got our food in like minutes. ��I had the chicken in mole sauce. ��It was the closest I have ever had to my gramas, and the woman knows her mole. ��Plus its BYOB and there is a liquor store about 5 stores down."
"This place is perfect. The food was great, and the service was phenomenal. In addition, they have this hot apple pear tea that is awesome. Overall, great place!"
"I am a total sushi snob and very particular. The only thing that is unfavorable about this place is the wait. Excellent menu, great service. Best sushi in Chicago by far."
My favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago. ��Delicious artichoke chicken pasta dish is my fave!
"Look everyone. Yes, they make the best hot dawgs i know of in Chicago. (I know there is one guy where you have to wait 2 hours in line, i'm too busy for that). But PLEASE, if you want to do yourself a favor, try the burgers. The Whoopercheesie on dark bread is one of those things you will never forget."
"$13 for a Caprese salad? $9 for garlic bread that is made on mushy bread that you would expect to find at Walmart? Spaghetti for $17 swimming in half an inch of olive oil with so much garlic that you stop after 3 bites? Do yourself a favor - at these kinds of prices, you can go to Mia Francesca and get a superbly Italian created meal that puts anything here shame. Quite honestly, this was a complete waste of money."
"The food and beer were awesome, really tasty and not crazy expensive. ��The wait staff wasn't great - but they weren't bad. ��They were pretty busy, so they seemed overworked. ��I don't know how a restaurant can avoid that when they get big crowds like ours.I'd still recommend it, I just say go when you know it's not busy."
"I stopped in for a glass of wine and a cheese plate while visiting from Wisconsin. I've been there before, but not for a few years; the vibe was very different than what I recall. Less trendoid, more serious, is how I would describe Bin 36 today. The wine was a Portuguese red, and it was solid. It was a very traditional, classic red, exactly what you'd get from your old friend when you visited his home in Lisbon. It was comforting and familial, and had a casual, welcoming feel. I liked it a lot.The cheese, recommended by the server, was a knockout. I've never had anything quite like it. It was a bleu, from so-called 'Bleu Monde' Wisconsin (uh, this is Blue Mounds, WI, West of Madison), but the kicker was the rind. The cheese was good, unusually so, but the rind, after tasting, filtered bac"
It's the best Mexican dinner for your dollar in a pretty friendly environment. Super busy Sundays after church. Free parking around the corner on Laflin.
"Very good, but not worth all the hubbub! I'd rather eat at Wiener's Circle!!!!"
"Nice place with organic food offerings, that taste great. Average service though, and a little pricey. They have some interesting beers on their list and the ambiance is pretty nice. Would go there again."
"I heart Sapori. ��My husband and I were introduced to this place about 2 years ago, and we have been hooked ever since. ��The chef and wait staff are attentive, considerate, and warmhearted. ��The food is consistently divine. ��Some of my fave dishes...- lobster-stuffed pasta- lamb shank- pumpkin/b-squash ravioli- zuppa di pesceDon't forget dessert! ��The panna cotta, tiramisu, and bread pudding are lovely. ��Pair that up with some Moscato and you've got a great ending to a memorable meal.Bravo! ��We're devoted to you, Sapori!"
"What a classy place! ��I went there on a Tuesday night before seeing a show at the House of Blues. ��It was my first time there and I've been dying to go back. ��It's a classier place than I usually go and it's easy to get to from the CTA. ��The menu consists of glasses of wine, bottles, or wine flights. ��I did a wine flight for about $15.95 and it was well worth it. ��On Sundays, wine flights are $10, I recommend that! ��We also had a cheese flight which was really fun to try as well."
"Wow. What does one say?Deconstructed cuisine is a rarity. Principally because it's usually very expensive and NOT very fun. Here is the exception to the latter. It is FUN!Although EVERYTHING is a night to remember... for my wife and I? It's all about the black truffle.Run, and do not walk. (RESERVATIONS WELL IN ADVANCE)The staff has an uneasy blend of the hip and the savvy, but trust me... you will literally be well served."
"Top ��notch pizza paired with top notch people is what makes me a loyal CASH paying customer of Fogo 2Go! ��For a pinch past 7 bucks your stomach is full, your pallet wet, and your tastes buds trying to pry your mouth open for hope there is more to come. ��My favs are the margarita and the bbq chicken pizza (best bbq chicken I have ever had. TAKE THAT California Pizza Kitchen). ��Anyway, don't let the weather keep you in forcing yourself to finish off the left over tacos for the 3rd night in a row when there is food like this just around the corner. ��-Fogo 2 Go supporter, Nick P.-"
Favorite sushi.Try the White Dragon!
"I love everything about Art. My favorite thing is their cheap daily specials. Where else can you get a lasagna, baked mostaccioli, or manicotti dinner with entree, salad, soup, and bread for less than $6? There pizza is really good, too. I love stuffed pizza and they do it well. This is my go to place for out of town guests wanting Chicago-style pizza and they are always impressed."
Now that's a skirt steak sandwich! These guys know good food.
I really like this place for it's beer. I have yet to try the food. The service was nice and when I wanted some info on what beer I should try they really were great about explaining the tastes to me. Next time I am coming back for some grub and beer
"$50 a plate, and I've been here several times, and the dinner just gets better and better every time.The only disappointing thing was the salad bar. People rant and rave about their salad bar, but I was not impressed at all. It's not as big as people claim it to be and not a ton of options. Don't get me wrong, they have things you've probably never put on your salad before, but not my style.The endless amount of meet that they come around with is mouth watering. Great steakhouse, and can't wait to go back!"
"We made reservations for four, two months in advance and only had a choice for 9:30 pm. ?Ok, I get it. ?It is a newcomer in the steakhouse capital of Chicago. ?We really wanted to try it and give it 5 stars.We arrived at 8:45 and were told we would be seated closer to our reservation time. ?We went into the bar, which was packed solid.Noisy, with a not so good piano bar and singer. ?Could not hear the singer but we were able to grab two bar stools when a couple was called for their table. ?This helped a lot.Bartenders were great, professional. ?However, after two drinks and one hour and fifteen minutes later, I was starting to feel inebriated and hungry, shakey. ?My husband checked up at the desk and the answer was we are working on it. All right, by 10:30 we were ready to kiss this place "
"This is the story : I love steak. There is nothing like a great slab of steak to cheer me up. My birthday fell on a busy Thursday night and I did not feel like going out. My best friend planned this whole dinner party at Ruth's Chris Steak House. We went there and we had trouble finding a parking slot. I always order my steak to be cooked medium rare. To my surprise, it was sooo goodddddd! The meat was tender and it made me want more. All my friends had a great time too. Everything was good. The fries were done just right so I was sure that everything was cooked perfectly. We are definitely going back for more steaks and fries."
"Great staff, young crowd, lots of tattoos and piercings, but best of all: excellent, delicious, generously portioned vegan meals!"
"Coast is by far my favorite BYOB sushi place in Chicago. ��You have to get the Asparagus Beef, it is amazing. ��The Coast Crab Maki is my favorite roll."
"Let me start by saying its a nice place you can go get some beers and pizza. ?BUT this is not by any means Chicago or Deep Dish pizza, this is PAN pizza. ?Sorry guys Deep Dish pizza is not a bunch of dough, for all you who say this is Chicago's best deep dish you are sadly mistaken. ?For all you out of towners who thought you had deep dish in Chicago you were wrong and wronged by who ever told you that or took you there. ?I went there with a friend who told me I had to come and try this place as it was his favorite, it was a good pan pizza, but I was expecting deep dish. ? deep dish can be found at giordanos, lous, ginos, ect... not saying those are my favorites but they are deep dish. ?In closing Do NOT go to pequods if you are looking for deep dish, but they do have pan pizza which is ab"
I came here about 3 times and it was always a failure. One time I came here on a Saturday night with a couple of my girl friends. ��In total we were three people who waited 3 effin hours to get a table! ��The host let 5 other couples in front of us and then ended up sitting us at a table meant for 2 people and put an extra chair there. ��I mean he should have done that in the first place. ��I do not understand what the fuss is all about the only good thing here is the horchata. ��If you want real central american/Caribbean food I suggest you go somewhere else.
"I absolutely adore this place. We go there for lunch, for dinner and I would even go for breakfast and a few snacks.Servers are the nicest people around. If you go there for dinner DO NOT miss the calamari appetizer. Heaven on an arugula bed. The chopped salad is humongous and their soups should be sold by the gallon.They also have a really large table for large parties which is perfect for our more populated gatherings.The only thing that they need to control is the volume of the music, particularly if you happen to go on a Live show night. I guess it is to be expected but i still have my Latin American inclination to speak with the people I share my meals with. Go figure!. Otherwise this is a cozy, very well staffed and very friendly place."
"Talk about OVER RATED! ?The food was good, the staff, for the most part is so stuck up and they want to turn those tables FAST. ?It is very expensive for what you get. ?The hostess was so unkind! ?AManda out waitress was a total sweet heart!I like the communal table setting, fun and met some fun people, it is so loud you can't really have a good conversation with your friends on the other side of the table.As they bring your small plates they just slam it down on the table and in front of one of the people in your party and quickly mumble what it is. ?The pace is so frenetic it is not a place to go and and enjoy yourself and spend any quality time. ?I am sure this atmosphere is created that way so you get in, eat and get out so they can flip the tables. ?It is way over priced for the food "
"Here's why and why and why I might never go back...I went to Uncommon Ground for my B-day and was treated like crap. The hostesses made me and my family wait 40 minutes to sit down when there were more than enough tables open. Then to have both hostesses snicker about my family--YES I CAN HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR... not cool. When we sat down we were eyed down by the one of the hostesses on and off for 30 minutes... A.) We're not here to steal your cups or spoons B.) We're not here to start problems C.) We're just here to enjoy a brunch with family. ��Then we were told by the hostess that we can't have my B-Day cake and when we asked wwHHyy ??? 0_o Because ""it's unsanitary"" and ""a health code voilation from the city of chicago""... To make a note: the cake was from a licensed Bakery cleary Ma"
"Everything's excellent. ��Especially the Wasabi mashed potatoes, the Godzilla roll, the deep fried crab rolls (not sure what they're called) and pretty much everything. ��Service is great, price is right. ��BYOB is certainly a plus. ��It's got my vote for the best sushi in town. ��Cool place, great food, right price. ��Go here and you won't go wrong."
"My mom got food poisioning here from the breaded veal cutlet...she thought it looked a funny shade of brown when she was eating it but didn't pay much attention. I called back the next day to tell them and the guy that works there goes, everyone eats veal no one got sick, I ate the veal parmesan yesterday and I'm not sick. I hate when people do that it's like...you can eat ONE little bite that is contaminated and you're sick. It doesn't matter how many other people ate it...take some responsibility for it. He was just really rude about it, no apology nothing...I was trying to be nice just to inform them they may have gotten a bad supply. How rude. Never eating here EVER AGAIN/ and their baked alaska tasted liek s*** GUMMY and gross...and the alcohol that she used to light it on fire was SO"
"I've been here countless times since they've been open, yes its loud but you won't find more authentic food in Chicago.The food follows the seasons in true Italian tradition. I am amzed at the variety and depth of the specials. Last time was fresh grilled sardines to halibut in parchment. A true gem. Another plus is the wine list there are many options by the glass and the staff is most accomodating with letting you sample."
"Service at this place is non existence!!!! ��Food is too salty and msg, I couldn't stop drinking water to quench my thirst. ��And to top it off they asked us if we want rice which you'd think it's complimentary but NO, they charge $$$$...at a CHINESE restaurant?"
"I know that visitors to Chicago always want to go to Gino's East, but Giordano's has the best pizza in the city!This particular location is great because it's near CTA, South Shore and Metra. ��It's also near Millennium Park and has a view of the beautiful courtyard at Prudential Plaza. ��On a nice day - or if the restaurant is extremely busy - you can get your meal to go, complete with utensils and plates, and have a picnic in the courtyard or the park."
"I'm rating the restaurant not the bar, and I gotta say it was average at best. �� ��The service was weird. ��Our server was really short with us, not exactly friendly. ��My boyfriend had the brisket and thought it was really fatty and underdone. ��I had a Tilapia sandwich and it was fine. ��The fries--meh. ��The tables were insanely close together and there was a weird server-guy who kept walking by our table every couple of minutes asking if he could take things away. ��We clearly were still eating. ��Finally I told him he could take my plate and he kept walking by waiting for my boyfriend to finish. ��We paid the bill, and wanted to finish our drinks before we left and the guy STILL kept coming by to take A napkin--one at a time. This place was just weird. And the food wasn't good enough to make m"
"Never did I think that foie gras belonged on a hot dog, but here I stand corrected....and full. It's too bad I don't live in Chicago or I'd go back until I had tried everything on the menu.Hot doug's is awesome. It's one of the single greatest places I've ever eating. It pulls no stops in making your food delicious yet cheap. There's always a long line, which tells you something, but getting your food doesn't take long once you're in there. Doug himself is a really nice guy (I recognized him from watching the No Reservations episode). The food is awesome: I had the duck hot dog with foie gras, the Sonoran, and the Buffalo one (it was filled with blue cheese and deliciousness). OK, i shared these with my fiance, but they were all amazing.My only recommendations if you go to Hot Doug's are:1"
"I LOVE this place. It's so much fun. When you first go to this resturant you can't imagine the treat you are headed for. Food is awesome, the atmosphere is fun, staff is wonderful.We had this wonderful pork thing that was marinated and deep fried...at first you think EWW but it was absolutely delightful. The cafe con leche was delicious and reminded me of my time in Florida A definate place to visit if you would like to get away from the city but don't have the time."
This evening was the first time I ordered out from Calo Ristorante; usually I dine in. Have always loved their food and tonight was no exception!
The experience was HORRIBLE from beginning to end. The waitress was VERY slow and never came to our table to check on us. The worse part was paying for food that lacked taste. I WILL NEVER GO BACK and to top it off the manager was very unprofessional. DONT WASTE your time NOR MONEY!!!
I really don't know what others see in this place. ��My pasta was not edible and the server cared less. ��The red pepper flakes were so overpowering the broccoli and shrimp got totally lost. ��After 2 bites my mouth was on fire. ��The menu description made no mention of pepper flakes. ��I truly believe flakes to this extreme are used to cover up less than fresh or flavorful food. ��So many better Italian and BYO's in Chicago - don't wast time or money on this one.
"Went this weekend. SOO Worth the wait. The truffle egg toast should be illegal it's so good. Same for the polenta board. RIDICULOUS! Pre Arcade Fire meal, epic evening"
"Good beer, good burgers. ��Luckily, places like this are easier to find in Chicago. ��The place doesn't stand out among others."
"Chicago has lots of great restaurants and eateries. This one is not to be missed for all the right reasons: Great food, friendly service, neighborhood flava, and right price. While not cheap, the food is Authentic with a cap-A. Owner is very present and all family friendly. Nice garden for the summer. Seasonal menues make it a place to return to every 2-3 months, cuz you'll never get to eat all you want on the menu in one meal... Lots of imagination and style without being fussy. Marinated grilled lambs heart were mind blowing... I know not for the faint of heart (sorry) but a simple, rich, and tasty adventure. Perfect for Valentines Day. Tho I think I was the only person who tried it that night.Basic but excellent wine list by glass 250 or Bottle. When it comes to real regional Italian, t"
This and Phoenix are worth the trip to China town alone! ��I love it!!!!
"We came here to check out the space as a possible venue for a party of 175 people--the space is really modern and the food was reasonably priced. ��Everything was great until the waiter thought it would be funny to pour my friend a glass of ""water""(--literally, no joke) and tried to pass it off as Riesling...terrible thing to do, especially when you never know who you will be trying to fool...perhaps someone in the wine business! The even funnier thing was, one of us had the Riesling in a glass(all of us had glasses of water) to which we could compare the ""water"" version--there was no question that the glass of wine was water. ��Apparently, this bartender thought he was Jesus!!! I have a tolerance for unwarranted bad service, but when it is deliberate as it was in this instance, it is beyond"
amazing!
"Xoco is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! Rick Bayless really hit a grand slam with this Mexican street food endeavor! I often bring out of town guests here and it's always a hit (great food and ambiance). Two glorious words for you: COCHINITA PIBIL (slow-roasted suckling pig) torta! A word of caution: the habanero sauce served with it is HOT (will burn the lips right off your face)! Their caldos are amazing too, especially the mariscos. For dessert we always order the hot from the fryer churros with a side of ice cream (quite spectacular)! Parking in that area is a pain, and the wait time may be close to an hour (just serve yourself some sparkling water w/ lime or peruse the menu), but once you get a table number and order, the food comes out really fast. ��Buen provecho!"
"The dining experience was good overall. ��But when you're spending this kind of money you need to be blown away. ��Given the coinage we dropped here, this place was a disappointment. ��I'm sure that people will drone on and on about how great this place is, but it's the Tim Tebow of restaurants. ��Totally over-hyped."
"I have been to Fox and Obel numerous times because it is located 1 block away from my home, but whenever I go, I ALWAYS leave disappointed. ��The majority of my visits are to get a quick bite at the cafe, which ends up being far from ""quick"" as the staff is extremely slow to serve the food. ��My order is screwed up about 80% of the time as well, and as everyone already knows, the prices are outrageous, especially for the service and quality that you get. ��If that doesn't already dissuade you from eating at the cafe, one time I found a large green bug in my salad that blended right in except for its movements (yes, it was still alive). I've been content with the grocery store part of Fox and Obel (except for the prices of course) and the service in the grocery store has been great as well. ��H"
"Geja's is a Chicago Institution for a reason! What a great place. I always take Yelp reviews with a grain of salt because every review just depends on who wrote it. Well, I'm in the restaurant business and I have to say they nailed it. Many reviews mentioned the prices and while it's not the least expensive place to dine but it IS worth every penny! I dined there with my wife for our 1st anniversary and we both agree it's where we'll spend every anniversary going forward. ��It's unlike any other restaurant I've been too or worked in. What an experience from the first course to last. There was never a dull moment or lull in conversation at our table. At one point we tried to be more quiet because we could tell the people next to us wanted to listen to the guitar player but it was just too mu"
Watch out when eating there. Parked with valet and got a ticket that they ripped up and only when the noticed was mailed to me did I know. ��I contacted Garcia's for help getting contact info and no one would call me back from Garcia's. I won't be eating there again
"This may be one of my favorite new places to go. ��I live just around the corner from here and I have to say having a place like this to stop in after work is fantastic. ��I usually come in for a drink and may some snacks. ��The pretzel with rarebit is my favorite. ��Also the St. Ambroise stout on top doesn't hurt either. ��If I was a whiskey drinker I would probably add another star, but I am definately fine with the beer selection, man is it good."
"I love to cook and this is the best source for top ingredients in the midwest.They source from the very best producers in the US and Europe.They usually have three to four kinds of Prosciutto, four to five selections of loxsmoked salmon. The pates are amazing and they even have fresh ��foie gras in season. They carry White Lily Flower, all kinds of butters, and the cheese selection is marvelous. The fresh meat, poultry and fish is top, top grade. In addition, the little cafe in the back has some of the best food in town.So, go there even if you are not buying groceries but just hungry.Parking is free. Yes it is a bit pricey but it is the very best."
"Simple, reasonable priced, and exceptionally delicious. ��I've ordered a variety of items off their menu, and have only been delighted at what I've received.The chicken is incredibly crisp and moist, the bowls are reasonably healthy and full of flavor and the sides are up to par with the rest of the menu.A friendly staff and casual environment make this a great place to grab a bite in the Lakeview area."
"Their beer at best is so-so, and seems to lack any depth or character.I ordered the vegetarian rueban, and was served another dish. My bartender insisted that she heard me order what was served. I was speechless.To sum up revolution....bad beer, bad service.For a complete opposite experience, Piece Brewery is only a few blocks south."
"Got last minute reservations for my mother's birthday and it was better than expected! Sure, there were good reviews on Yelp but you never know until you try it out for yourself. We had a table for 8 and it was a little cramped and stuffy but it was more cozy living room than hot sweatshop. Anyways, we started off with warm, homemade, crusty bread. We are a carb-loving family so that was very much appreciated. For appetizers, we ordered the fried calamari, mussels in red sauce, and avocado bruschetta. Everything was made well. The calamari was lightly breaded, not oily, and perfectly crunchy. The mussels were fresh and flavorful. Although the avocado bruschetta was not tasty or interesting, the avocado was very fresh.We all loved our entrees. The white clam sauce linguine was a little on t"
"What can I say?!? I LOVE Giordano's deep dish pizza! ��My family buys the frozen ones and takes them back home every time we eat there. ��The only disadvantage to this Giordano's (as opposed to other ones throughout the city) is that it is the busiest. ��You can expect to wait 1-1.5 hours to get a table. ��On the bright side, you pre-order, so your pizza should be just about ready when it is time to eat."
"I will start by saying that the ambiance was there - interesting artwork, ambient lighting, and what we thought would be good service. ?However, we were soon disappointed. ?The meals were lackluster and overpriced. ?The gnocchi special in tomato cream sauce lacked flavor; this could have been overlooked if the price was $10 and not $25. ?The lobster ravioli - also $25 was unrecognizable as such under a heavy cream sauce that was not even reduced enough, so still tasted like milk. ? Though completely unorthodox in Italy, I doused the sauce with parmesan for flavor. ?I brought most of it home to go so that I can doctor up the sauce myself. ?I would have preferred a lighter more flavorful sauce. ?What do chefs usually do to wow customers with their lobster ravioli? Whatever that is, it is unk"
"I seems overly expensive, honestly. The portions are average-good, their presentation is good, but the content is alright. The food isn't very unique, it's flavors average. I've had two waitresses treat me inconsiderately, though. Not a major thing, but still something to consider. One said that's not on the menu right now but I can sell it to you then proceeded to mention that she was doing me a favor by selling me some extremely overpriced piece of cheesecake. Still, I might recommend."
Love this place!!! The house salad is a must and any one of the steaks are amazing! ��Wine list is top notch. Service is amazing again and again. You MUST try the butter cake. Is delish! ��All the other Chicago steakhouses have some stuff competition. I keep going back!
"OMG!!! If you love meat Brazzaz is the best place to go. The ambiance is modern & romantic. Perfect for a date or a girls night out. The price is only $50 a plate, which is cheap for down town. They have all-you-can-eat beef, pork, duck, chicken, seafood & a salad bar. The service is amazing! FYI you will have to pay for parking. You will not be disappointed if you go."
"no better mexican food in the city. huge burritos, fresh quac, the nachos are fantastic! get a pitcher of margaritas and enjoy!"
"I was ready to write a scathing review, to cover as descriptively as I am capable how disgusting and insulting was the evening I spent at Schwa recently. ��However, before I wrote it, I read Michael Carlson's Wikipedia entry: http://en.wikipedia.org/��_.Please read it before going. ��It will open your eyes to the 'scoop' and will most likely encourage you to go and experience the greatness of his culinary arts.Schwa is not just another restaurant in the Chicago 'fine dining' category. ��It isn't Alinea, Tru, Everest, Spaggia. ��It is none of these. ��In order to enjoy it, you must walk on the burning coals of loud and unappetizing rap/hip hop music several decibels too loud to hear the person next to you. ��You must not ask too many questions and enjoy being served by young 'disrespectful' staff ("
"I was very disappointed with this place! From the crazy loud atmosphere to the people bumping into you as they walk by. I felt like I was in a frat house back in college. We waited forever to sit down, I don't care how good the mac and cheese is. No food is worth having to scream to talk with your friends you are sitting at the table with!I thought the food was average and for all the negatives I'd rather skip this place all together!"
"Worth the hype. ��We had great service, love the great menu of southern-influenced exotic cocktails they've brewed up. ��Food we had: heart of palm salad, gumbo ya-ya, shrimp & grits, and the modern take on red velvet cake all superb."
"Lincoln Park greatness. ��The service is immaculate, and the food is greatI went here a lot of times to order Pho soup and their great lunch specials (Salmon Noodle). ��After a yelper recommended Chicken Clay Pot, I definitely am sold on this place as one of the best in Chicago. ��I even took my parents here when they came to visit. ��The main manager/owner is a very nice gentleman who usually adds something to your meals wether its an unexpected lemonade , or just casual conversation."
"I've been here twice because it is close to where I live and I LOVE mexican. ��This place is very disappointing and I'm sort of surprised that it has survived in this neighborhood. ��I like simple things like tacos and enchiladas. ��Frankly, some of the worst mexican food. �� You can do much better in terms of food. ��I guess most people go here for the margaritas and then get so drunk they don't really care how the food tastes!"
"It simply amazes me that people can actually rave about this place as if it's the best thing since sliced bread. Having grown up in Pilsen, my family, friends and I have known of this place since the early 80's and we all agree that it is the most overrated (and politically connected) business in Pilsen. ?Everything from the tacky facade paint ?job, to the mediocre tasting food, to the indifferent almost rude servers, this place does not aim to please it's customers at all. Yet once a year for the last 12 years or so and mainly out of support for my old community, I give this place a visit hoping it's finally worth recommending. The decor still lacks warmth, the refried beans are still greasy and overcooked and the miserable waitresses are still indifferent to the customers needs. ?The las"
"They've got a vegetarian burrito that will ruin all other burritos for you forever. ��If you are not a fan of mushrooms, zucchini, and plantains in your burrito (I know a lot of you freaks are out there) then you will still be satisfied. ��Their menu has something for everyone.This place has one chill atmosphere, too. ��It is great coming here in the summer time.My only VERY REAL complaint is that every single time I've come here, they either forget to put Jalepenos in my burrito (which is the case 90% of the time) or so many jalepenos that you can't taste anything else. ��I would recommend asking for jalepenos on the side, though, you might have to ask more than once.But definitely go, it is BYOB, and there is an excellent liquor store conveniently located across the street. ��It is also cash "
Salmon on the plank !!!! ��The skillet cookie at the end! ��Enough said!!
"Howdy, first time yelper here!Me and the hubby saw this place on tv and with no reservations (make em') we waited well over an hour to sit at the bar tuesday night and enjoy some all you can eat crab legs.Yes, the crab legs were outstanding. ��However, we unfortunatelly had to listen to one of the waitresses brag? To her coworkers, repeatedly, and with in ear shot of ourselves and a bar full of happy eaters, about confronting some customers that tipped her only 10% of the bill. ��Here's a tip, keep your lip zipped.Even if the standard tip should be 15%There are bunches of people ��who can't afford to leave more than a 10%, you should be ashamed of yourself. ��The food and service ��was great but we wont be back."
"I thoroughly agree with all sentiment to the effect of 'TOTALLY AVOID THIS LOCATION!' ��The absurd wait here already presents an undue hardship for wearied Chicago travelers--considering there is a substantial number of other locations throughout the city which undoubtedly offer at least the same but probably better food and service without the unbearable, prerequisite limbo.If you need to be convinced, here's a case in point: ��Arriving in a cab on a weekend night, one first waits in the inevitable gridlock that surrounds this location, at a perimeter of about three or four blocks, for roughly 15 minutes. ��Upon finally nearing the curb out front, a nebulous horde of patrons emerges into view and is understood, at closer proximity, to be practically barring the front entrance from both insid"
"I visited for the first time this week. The restaurant is very nicely appointed, with copper/tin ceilings, very elegant large bar, and quaint stage area near the bar. There was a semi-private event there when I visited on 12/11 and a jazz trio was playing from this stage, a part of the semi-private event. I really wanted to have dinner at Wilde, but for some reason, after 3 requests and a 1+ hour wait at the bar, I was NEVER GIVEN A TABLE!! ��But, the place was packed and there was a fine assortment of beers, and the live music was very good. My table request just got lost in the shuffle. Half-starved, I paid my bill and went next door to dine at the Bamee Noodle. The Wilde B&R is a welcome addition to East Lakeview. There are a lot of dining choices here, but none are as nice in appearance"
"I work around the corner from this place and had to try it for lunch. ��I ordered the steak sandwich, and it was well worth the wait. ��I ordered in, and sat at their bar stools that line the wall at one end of the place. ��The seating is what it is. ��I'd only recommend it if its just you, or one other friend. ��I really see this place taking of as a great take-out place for the area, and hope their outdoor seating gets well used in the evenings for the dine in dinner crowd. ��Some umbrellas or a canopy and BYOB proudly displayed would get that ball rolling."
"we were looking forward to our experience at Graham Elliot. ��Unfortunately, we were seated more than one hour late for our reservation. �� �� The only items that were on time were the wine selections. �� ��our main course arrived more than 40 minutes after the appetizer course and two of our four main course meals were cold. �� The pace is off here and the food is not allowed the opportunity to live up to its potential. �� Based on our experience, we will not return."
"I really enjoyed the pizza here. It isn't the best pizza I have ever had, but it is great for being in the neighborhood. The tin crust is perfectly crisp without being like a cracker. For $3 a slice it is well worth it."
"Awfull service, long line even when it was empty upstairs, the manages were terrible i had to leave the place.There are many good place in Chicago, if that place continue like that its going to close like the last three restaurants that were there."
"Plaka in Athens, Greece is my favorite Greek restaurant. However, if you cannot make it to Athens, go to Greek Islands. My parents started going to Greek Islands when they were dating. Now, over twenty-five years later, my family and I go to Greek Islands regularly. Starting when you pull up for the valet, which is free by the way, I'm always greeted by the smiling valet service. Depending on the night, you may have to wait for a table, but it is worth the wait.Olive oil with delicious, crunchy, and soft bread and water is immediately set on the table. The service is always wonderful and I have never had a bad experience. All the food is incredible. Thankfully, we all share as a family, so I do not have to decide on only one thing to eat. The following are my favorites and they are all inc"
"Just had the most amazing night at Lockdown Bar and Grill. The atmosphere and the food totally rock!!! �� The appetizers were great (starting with the great chips that arrive as soon as you sit down). We had the Prison Shanks which were so good I couldn't stop eating them and the Vietnamese sandwiches were so tasty. I had heard so many great things about the Mac and Cheese and it did not disappoint - awesome!!. ��Plus my friends and I shared several burgers including the Warden Burger and the Arson Burger. This is some of the best food I have ever had. Check it out, you will be happy you did."
"On a recent trip to Chicago, we decided to have lunch here. ?We had eaten here a couple years ago for lunch, and we loved it. ?This time was not so good. ?We did not have a problem getting a table as other reviewers have experienced. ?We decided to try a couple of the small plates to share. ?We ordered the Throw back trio, an order of the chard, and an order of the fried plantains. ?We were completely dissatisfied with all of our choices. ?The throw back trio was $18 and was barely enough for an appetizer for one person. ?The smoked chicken taquitos were not edible. ?They were so smokey, it tasted like a piece of charcoal. ?I had to chew gum the rest of the day in order to get the taste out of my mouth. ?The plantains were just that - plain. ?They had no taste.The service was very slow for"
The best food I've ever had in Chicago!
"This is by far my favorite cafe. They have great Greek Coffee. and there desserts are delicious. the customer service couldn't be better, by far the best waitress i have had in a while."
"Caro Mio has a cute, romantic atmosphere. It's a small cozy restaurant. I went on a Saturday night and it was pretty packed. The food was excellent- traditional Italian food just as it should be. The menu offers many choices from pasta to veal to seafood, etc. They lost a star because they do use ALOT of garlic. Also, the service was a little slow and we had like 4 different guys coming to our table. Other than that everything was really good!"
"As a restaurant, eh ... not so much.As a bar that serves food ... Love it!If you go expecting a crowded place with an extensive beer selection that happens to serve food, you will be very pleasantly surprised. ?Especially if you like mussels. ?They happen to be one of my favorite foods, so finding a place that serves deLISHous mussels in a casual atmosphere with good beer for reasonable prices is like a little slice of heaven for me. ?If that sounds like heaven to you, too, go to Hopleaf. ?Just go early, especially on weekends, or you'll have one hell of a wait for a table."
"Let's start by saying that I go out pretty frequently and enjoy a good sports bar with great food and a friendly staff. ��The Fifty/50 offers all the above and more. ��Living in the suburbs I don't make it to the 50 nearly as much as I would like to. ��Every time I have been there the service has been great, the food excellent, (HUGE wings) and very reasonably priced for the area. ��The bar seating is comfortable and the decor is upscale and modern with lots of individuality.Great place. ��I look forward to going back very soon!"
"I NEVER have been treated this way from any restaurant!!!OK. I went to this Giordanos today March 16th. Me and my three friends ordered lots of stuff and the food was great. And the service was OK. We got the check and paid with cash and credit card. We wanted change back on the cash but our server comes back with uncorrect change. So we explained about the miscalculation but she didn't get it the first time. Later she got it and went to get correct change. THEN a guy comes back and the first thing he says "" whose card is this? sign this. Sign this and then go"" �� ��WTF? We were happily talking until then and this manager guy comes and tells us to leave without explanation about miscalculated change? Whoa! watch your attitude! ��That manager guy stood until my friend signed and took the recei"
"Food was good.. not great.. some of the spice was over powering taking away from the flavor, I'd like to enjoy the food for what it is, everything is fresh which is great, however a little pricey.. place was pretty small too."
"I've heard about this place from several people and finally tried it out. ��Just as I heard, the house-brewed beer with amazing even though I'm not normally much of a beer drinker. ��The selection is broad and I loved the single something (lighter, sweeter) selection. ��For the pizza, I went with the plain style and LOVED it. ��I will definitely be back. ��They said they were closing early last night at 9:30 instead of 10:30 like usual-- not sure why, but I loved it anyway. ��The atmosphere is a little rough, but the food makes up for it."
"simply it, being simply only the best place I wanna get vietnamese food from!we came in as a huge group last week, unfortunately our group was running 25 minutes late and they had to serve some other customers. The owner however made it up to us while we waited and chatted with lots of small appetizers that I couldn't get enough of!When we were seated, service was prompt, our food came out fairly quickly. I ordered the Simply It's beef, it was simply... YUMMY.Nice socializing time, BYOB is a huge plus for this restaurant, many others at my table seemed to enjoy their meal as well. We were checked up on often enough to make sure all was well. 5 stars! one of Lincoln Park's best gem of a restaurant."
"Chicago locals should not shy away from BIN 36 - it would be unfortunate. ��BIN has been around for 11 years, and there is a reason for that. ��This place does wine like no other wine bar does - it makes it fun, light and easy where every other wine bar in the city is dark and intimidating. ��The cheese selection is unbelievable and if i ever want cheese, i know where to go. ��The menu is always solid and offers a great variety. ��Things that should not go unnoticed: ��the BIN Wine School....also, it's so much better of a place to buy a bottle of wine from than dominick's or jewel! ��You know you are going to get a great bottle of wine, cause they ��have all been selected carefully and thoughtfully! ��I've never had a bad bottle here!"
"Good food, but I must say that for price I will not be a returning customer. Don't get me wrong, the service was fine, and everything I ate was great but I can go to a hole in the wall restaurant on Argyle street and have the same quality food, sans the classy ambiance."
"I picked this place for a friend's birthday, and NO ONE was disappointed! ��Food and presentation was amazing, same as the service.My favourite part was the dessert plated on a monkey sculpture, and the dessert cart at the end which loaded with small french treats!! ��I was so regret that I was too full to try every single item on the cart. Will def go back on a special occasional to impress friends/family again!"
1. CHEAP2. BYOB3. AMAZING CRAB RANGOON4. AMAZING FOOD PERIODDo I need to say anything else? Go here.
"As the food goes I'll give Le Colonial a 3, as the service goes I'll give them a 3, and as the service goes for their valet parking company 0.This place seriously needs to contract a better valet company. We went to Le Colonial for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon (not a lot of lunch traffic), and after our meal, which was good, but a little over priced for authentic Vietnamese cuisine (I would take the location into account if the valet service wasn't horrible), we went to claim our car. ?After about 10 minutes of waiting beside an empty valet stand, another woman joined us in waiting from the restaurant; and not only did we stand there for an additional 5 minutes, but when the valet guy showed up he takes both our and the second woman's ticket and says to the woman behind us Well your car "
"Went to Wishbone Friday morning for breakfast with my mom! ��The food was good. ��I had the blackened catfish breakfast. ��Mom had the crunchy french toast. ��Both were good, the hot chocolate was much bigger than I had imagined and good too. ��However, the service was a B-. Although it was not very busy the waitress seemed stressed. ��She refilled mom's coffee so fast she spilled some on her hand. The food was good, service was ok."
"Nice menu selection and even nicer drink menu selection. Overall the food was okay (had a seafood medley dish with a heavy sauce but the shrimp in it had to be peeled, ended up being very messy and a pain).The prices though are too expensive for the quality of the food you receive. If you're on a budget and want a lot of bang for your buck than this is not the place for you.The atmosphere is definitely the highlight. Beautiful layout, huge space, bright colors, fun photos, mirrors, cool ceiling fixtures, lamps and plants all over the place.Fun place to try once, maybe a second time at most."
"I love this place. I could sit at the bar all day to accept as a challenge their motto Whiskey for your mouth, not for our shelves, but then I'd miss the food.And the food! The food!The menu changes often and there will probably be words you don't understand, so ask your sever if you need help, order a couple small plates, and you'll have room for dessert.No reservations, no problem. Enjoy the whiskey selection, cocktails, and beers while you wait.Also, I cannot stand going out to brunch at most places. But I absolutely love brunch here."
"Yummy chicken tikka masala - the chicken had a nice smoky flavor, much more prominent than many others I've had. ��The mater paneer was lacking a little on flavor."
Overall decent Italian food. I had their octopus and ravioli and really enjoyed both. Their wine list was nice. Everything I've tried has been quite tasty. There's really not much to say that many other reviewers haven't said.
The food is amazing. ��I have two tickets for tomorrow night (Sunday) at 8:45 if anyone is interested I will sell them at cost. ��I sadly won't be able to make it again. ��E-mail me if interested Jchoffler@gmail.com
Casual atmosphere rocks.
"My favorite Persian Restaurant. Good food, service, atmosphere and pricing. I have been working my way through the menu and love it all from the chicken soup to dessert. I always bring my out of town family and friends for some some nice wine and a great meal."
"I absolutely love this place. The rock shrimp is SOOO good..highly reccommended! Service is great and the waiters are very friendly and always ready to help. ��It's a beautiful place too, I think the retunda is the best room in the whole restaurant..absolutely stunning. I also reccommend the pan seared chicken breast another one of my favorites. This place is wonderful..better than the Cheesecake Factory to me. It's wonderful and you won't regret it!!"
I love this Place the food is really good speically the burritos!!!! there huge i can barely finish 1/2 of one!! the serves is okay......... the salsa is amazing the best i have ever had
"So, we were apartment hunting in the area and STARVING, so when we drove by I remembered this girl at work talking about how she loved this place and that's how we walked in. There were four of us and not one of us had ever experienced 'southern' cooking. the fried green beans were out of this world, and the Shrimp Fricassee (sp?) was amazing, i wanted to have it as my main course! the mac and cheese wasn't amazing as i had been lead to believe, but it was still good. our entrees were OK, and the only suck was our waiter must have taken 4 smoke breaks, bc he would disappear and then come talk to us and spew tobacco all over. gag. oh, and the lights above the table were really cool, except for the inch of dust covering them. you almost want to eat like a prisoner, hovering over your food so"
"This is my favorite pizza joint. ��Being from the east coast, I don't love deep dish, and theirs is a little different than others I've tried here; less heavy, and tastier. ��On weekends they will let you make a reservation, but it doesn't get you a table right away. ��You just get priority over the people who have just walked in. ��But you can put your pizza order in while you wait since it takes so long to cook anyway.Side note, I chose this as my last solid meal before getting my wisdom teeth out! ��Must be my favorite meal!"
"Maybe I'm biased because I live upstairs in the building and I have a family member who is great friends with the owner and most of the waitstaff, but I make my friends come to me and try to park on the Gold Coast to have a meal, and my parents join me here for dinner at least once a week, so I feel kind of like family.First off, the fresh-ground 3rd Coast special blend coffee is EASILY the best in the city...I can grab a coffee and a scone and have that for dinner...Everything I've eaten on the menu is terrific...Love the turkey and"
"First time visitor to The Gage. Dinner was wonderfull. Service was even better. Atmosphere a bit loud for me and my wife, but would definitely go back . My servers name was Elena. She recommended the risotto and it was delicious. Looking forward to stopping by again for dinner."
This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Get it in and see why.
"I have no idea what kind of restaurant these 1-star reviewers expected, but Nana's is THE place to go on a Saturday or Sunday morning/afternoon. ��My girlfriend and I visit at least twice a month, and always sit at the bar to chat with the owner, her sons and the great and hilarious bartender. ��Service is fast and friendly, the food is delicious every time. ��This restaurant is EXACTLY what Bridgeport needed. ��Thank you Nana for opening this place!"
What a selections of dogs and sausages!The only downside is the wait so you have to get there early.Comming back next week.
one of the best pizza joints there is out there in Chicago....they had me at the first bite...give it a try when u got a craving for sum Chicago pizza...u would not be disappointed....so cheese on..^O^
"Graham Elliott was the singularly worst dining experience of my life. ��I took my wife there for her 49th birthday. ��I specifically requested a quiet booth. Had the staff been honest they would have told me that this place doesn't exactly do quiet. ��I would have had no problem with such an honest disclosure. ��I would have taken my $400.00 for a dinner for two and enjoyed a superior dinner at Moto's or some other superior restaurant with better service, food and atmosthpere. ��Instead, I endured at shamelessly average 15 course meal from hell served to the sound of shrieking skinhead music at a decibel level that made me pray for the tarmac at O'hare. ��If you like the sound of shrieking, screeching guitar music limited to three chords and played at a volume that makes your ears bleed this is "
If you are truly a fan of sushi steer clear of this place! Virtually all the rolls contain something fried or are drenched in mayonnaise-y sauces. Even the ginger dressing is made from mayo - hello calories! Sushi is supposed to be light and fresh fish - not grease and fat. Ick. ��Even the miso soup is off - there is tofu and seaweed there but the broth tastes like straight up sodium. No true flavor.The service was good... but the lacking quality of the food leaves me NEVER wanting to go back. ��There are too many other better places in the city that offer real sushi and PARKING.
"I am giving it a 5 because the service was good and waiter was always attentive and ��of course the food was great! We ordered ��3 appetizers goat's cheese with marinara ,crab cake and scallops. The scallops were undercooked and I let the waiter know, he mentioned it ��to the manager and she shortly came and ��apologized and said they were not going to charge us for it.It was my date's B-day and she loves steak and ��was very happy with it, I ��had their fish special which ��was very good. the atmosphere was cozy and ��relaxing."
"Great restaurant with good food and excellent owners. I've only had 4 dishes or so here, but they were all 4/5 stars if not better. Now when I come, I just get the staple beef pho and call it a day. 7 bucks to fill me up? I'm down. They always end your meal with complimentary fruits. It ranges from mangos, pears, apples, to pineapples and blueberries. 2 more good things about them. 1) The owners/waitresses are always so nice and helpful when you're there. 2) If you order to-go, they package everything so nicely!4 stars for food, 5 for service. Bumped down to a 4 since this isn't a high-end restaurant, so the actual food should count more than the experience."
"Sunda - what a blunder!!!!We (couple of my friends and I) decided to go to Sunda for our New Year brunch hoping for a great meal. First thing we found was that it was a reduced menu but we decided to keep an open mind when we saw that it said $10 unlimited dim sum when you order an entree. We had a reservation yet it took 10 mins for someone to come take our drink orders. When the drinks came, my order was wrong (how confusing is it when the order is a lychee mimosa but I got what I thought was a mango mimosa). The server didnt even notice it and didn't bother to come ask us how our drinks were. Then we order our food (after another 10 min wait for the server to come back). Now the restaurant was busy but not packed so these delays didnt make sense. We had ordered 3 entrees and 3 sets of d"
this is the best chicago has to offer. the food is a 10 and the staff is the same!! ��we we in chicago for 8 days and wehad breakfast and lunch her 5 times. the price is right and the food the best.
This place was awesome. I highly recommend the made to order desserts.
"Another great steakhouse, but much more reasonably priced than Capital Grille. ��Def the place to go if you have family in town and want to impress them. ��Their pastas, steaks, and even seafood are really fresh and very tasty.Service is excellent. ��We always get a free dessert or drink or something special."
"Love this place. Their prices are very affordable for the quality of food they have. Great BYOB place, good patio and great customer service."
"Excellent food, nice atmosphere and exceptional service...missing 5 stars because of the wretched stench on your clothing after you've dined at Gejas. But damn the food and service were great - 5 stars it is!"
"Pho was ok, not the best I've had in Chicago nor anywhere else! The best was in Vietnam, then Virginia, then CA. I got pho tai (rare meat but become medium/fully cooked in the piping hot broth). The broth color is darkish, and the basic aroma is there. It just didn't hit the spot for me. The pho itself was decent, meat was ok.The bad: I also ordered 1 LARGE pho to go �� -- and it pissed me off that they didn't give me much at all. While I ate in, a large is HUGE. When I got home and opened the to-go Large -- it was SMALL and PATHETIC looking. It looked even smaller than the ""small"" portion at the restaurant. Also, they barely gave me any veggies/beansprout w/ to-go order. Seriously, 1 mediocre stalk of limpy basil, 2 toothsaw stalks, and about 20 bean stalks along w/ 2 skinny slices of jala"
"A Chicago-must. It takes a few minutes for your eyes to adjust down here as the romantic candles and fondue burners are the only thing lighting the basement-like restaurant. With the Melting Pot as it's only major fondue competition in the city, Geja's offers a considerably more unique experience for special occasions.For those unsavvy about fondue dining- Geja's starts each meal with a small salad, and then has three different types of fondue- cheese (with apples and bread to dip) to start, oil for the main course, and chocolate for dessert. Though Melting Pot offers a few more variables (particularly with the dessert options) you still cant go wrong with Geja's, it's less expensive without a drop in quality, and an infinitely better dining experience.Factor in more time (3 or more hours)"
"First of all, you'll love the concept! Salad was top notch, and the meat was tender and melt in your mouth buttery, I only gave it 4 out of 5 because it's really pricey I think, unless you go for lunch which I can't always go to. I loved the inside of the restaurant too and the waiters are nice!"
"Large breakfast selection, great food, great space and I've never had to wait to be seated."
"i've been to Gino's East at O'hare and tasted their famous deep dish pizza but this one at Giordano's is much better for me. I thought that since i have already tried it at Gino's, it's still the same thing but Lo and behold, i was wrong! Even more wonderful coz we paired it w/ Samuel Adams... the result... a very great time! :) The only downside of this is that this place is kinda top dollar for me. We just ordered the medium deep dish pizza, mozarella finger appetizer at 2 pitchers of beer. Our tab, a measley $90... but again, i would say that i had a great time here plus the great deep dish pizza that they have..."
"Don't go on the weekends!!! ��Unfortunately, I made that mistake. �� The place was LOUD as hell, immediately giving me a headache. �� I thought I was in a concert hall. �� This place has huge ceilings, which seem to amplify every sound, there was even an echoe! �� The food was bland, nothing special. �� The mult-grain pancakes I ordered were too thick, not light and fluffy at all. �� I thought I was eating compressed wheat dough! ��There is no consistency in the quality of food at Yolk. ��I've eaten at the one in River North and the multi-grain pancakes were perfect (I got that after eating the horrible buttermilk pancakes which tasted like lemon? ) If you want ��breakfast in the South Loop, save yourself a headache and go to Eleven City Diner around the corner from Yolk on Wabash. �� Their pancakes "
I've been here a few times and recently found myself wondering why I don't come here more often. ��The chicken is delicious. ��The wings are meaty and every sauce I've ever had here is fantastic. ��I really want to try the bowls next time I go. ��So if you are looking for some really tasty chicken with a twist and then you need to go here. ��Service is fast and friendly and it's BYOB.
Lives up to the hype! ��Highly recommended.
"I love this place!. �� Great atmosphere, great food and wonderful staff. ��You can feel comfortable going by yourself or with a friend. ��I like the idea of having this type of restaurant/wine bar in the neighborhood. ��It is close by and very convenient. ��Try it and I promise you will go back again and again."
"I guess I'm not really the best person to review the Hopleaf, being that I've never actually drank OR dined there, but not for lack of trying.I've heard so many good things about it that I've TRIED to eat/drink there several times and it's always the same thing:You walk in, get carded and wait for service.....nothing happens.I've tried to get a table (even as early as 6pm) , but it seems the kind of place that people just sit forever at. ��I once stood at the bar for almost 15 minutes waiting to get a beer and ended up walking out. ��Another downfall is that it's obnoxiously loud in the front (i've never been to the back or upstairs), so loud that I had to yell for my friends standing right next to me to hear. ��If you like a moderately quiet atmosphere and good service, don't stop here."
I'd give them 5 stars if they came around with coffee more often ;) The food is spectacular!

"Chicago Diner is the best hands DOWN! The service is great (granted I'm friends with half of them), the food is to diiie for, it's a staple every time friends come in town... My boyfriend and I love the Diner... The Radical Rueben is BY FAR my favorite thing on the menu. Followed closely by the wings, nachos, black bean burger... and well, everything. I think the only thing I didn't like there was the gyros.. but I'm just not a fan of the seasoning of gyros. The sweet potato fries are awesome, as well as all the other sides. Everything there makes me and my tummy happy. I had the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough vegan shake for the first time the other day and OMGOODNESS i died a little. First vegan shake ever, and I've been vegan for a year and a half. Chicago Diner, is there anything you can'"
While brunch at Nana can get busy it is well worth the wait (normally not that long). The beignets are wonderful.
"We've enjoyed Opart Thai House many times over the years. ��Absolutely love the Khao Soy (very spicy), ordering it every time. ��Good price and BYOB make this a can't miss spot for dining in or carry-out.I'd avoid delivery because they are so busy, the food tends to be cold by the time you get it."
"We have gone to Glen's quite a few times for brunch, and have really liked it. ?However, due to the experience we had on Sunday morning, I will absolutely never go again. ?We got to the diner a few minutes early, as we were meeting 2 friends. ?There were 4 available tables outside, and about 9 available tables inside. ?The Host, asked how long our party would be, and we said a few minutes, as we knew they were on their way. ?He then informed us that it is their policy to not sit tables until all the guests had arrived. ?I understand this policy in a packed restaurant, but literally, the restaurant was not even at half compactly. ?So, I asked the Host, why we could not sit, considering their were open tables everywhere, and 4 waiters standing around with nothing to do. ?He said that is the "
They had a special one night last week - Vietnamese Soup that was very tasty. ��Friendly staff and the owner asked what we thought. ��There's a cozy booth in the back.
omg I love it there the food is so good. ��The people that work there and so sweet I love them so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Well my girlfriend and I dined here the other day. Not gonna lie, Great steaks on a plate. Simply as that. If you have a taste for quality steaks with nice flavor and cooked to your preference, I would highly suggest dining here.If your a super health nut I would not advise, but if youd like to endulge a flavorful night you definitely will leave satisfied. Pretty much how I felt after.So to sum it up in simplier terms. If you share the my views on a nice dinner. Try Mastro's."
"This place is expensive but we normal people always go with a free entree coupon. I love the salad bar - hearts of palm, seared ahi tuna - yum! Mushroom risotto, smoked salmon, haha - I should just go for the salad bar lunch. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a great steak, but I could eat their salad bar all day. As for the steak, well, the first few cuts I got were mouth-wateringly juicy and delicious. I guess I'm just not that big of an eater, because after awhile, it becomes too much. It's still good, but they all blend together, but I kept feeling like I had to stuff myself to the point of bursting to justify the price. Filet mignon wrapped in bacon was definitely my favorite. They didn't have lobster - when do they have the lobster? They didn't have lobster the last time I went, eithe"
"I've been here several times on various trips to Chicago so I figured now was the time to write about it. They have two things that make this place worth 4 stars, without these two things the restaurant would be a 3 star place.1. The cheese plate menu- The Fat Cat is probably the best but others are really amazing as well.2. The truffle honey that the cheese puffs are dipped in. Both of those things elevate this place to a higher level. The service is entirely dependent on how busy the restaurant is. On nights that are less busy the service can be excellent. However, on nights where things are a little more crowded I have found the services slipping quickly. Otherwise, the food is general good and the wine list is extensive. If you have never been I would suggest you go."
"Not AT ALL all it's cracked up to be, we're never going back there again! After waiting outside for 30 minutes, another 10 minutes before our order was taken, being yelled at very rudely by the host, we finally ordered 2 dishes. The waitress told us the dishes don't come with anything and we'd have to order rice or veggies separately, we told her that's ok we don't want to order anything. Over an hour of waiting later one of the dishes came along with 2 bowls of rice. We thought maybe she was wrong and the rice does come with the meal, but the second dish wasn't coming so we asked what was going on and the waitress said we only ordered one thing because apparently she saw me nodding and thought that meant I don't want to order food?? We called the manager over and he was siding with her st"
"Do not be fooled by the cakes in the pictures. They completely messed up an important order 6 mos ago and only offered to refund the difference in ingredients cost - what???Then at my wife's request we tried them again last week for 2 birthday cakes and again, completely messed them up. Do not trust these people with an order for an important event, they suck and do not even provide basic customer care even when they acknowledge that they messed up. That is 3 cakes completely screwed up folks - you decide. Also, the owner Peter is a complete Jerk and refused to provide a any type of credit other than the price of the missing ingredients. If I didn't care about the cake, I would go to Jewel and buy a 10.00 cake, at least then you know what you are buying.They will provide whatever cake they"
"I ate at Schwa when it first opened, once after he re-opened the restaurant after Chef Carlson's sudden close of Schwa and recently during last thanksgiving week. ��In summary, I think it has gone down severely in terms of food and service. ��When it first opened it I thought it was some of the most innovative food with flavors and preparation that were nothing short of mind-blowing good. It reminded me of Mugaritz with its bold and intelligent flavors and food combinations.After Carlson shut down and re-opened, I had another fantastic meal which was actually better than our meal at Alinea which we ate at the following evening. ��I have eaten at Alinea at least a half-dozen times and always thought Carlson was or could be in the same league as Grant in terms of sheer cooking talent and his de"
We love this place! A dive with great food & service. The chips are free and warm. The salsa is made there - the heat changes from day to day. Be sure to order the house tequila in your margarita.
"Man, what a bummer. I saw all of these great reviews and I thought this is perfect for my sister's birthday dinner of 10! However, I'm no dummy that is just going to plan a whole group dinner ?based on strangers reviews, so I went there tonight Friday at 6pm. We were both starving-would have thought anything was great. (let me also preface this by saying we do have good taste in food and I cook very well myself.) The bruchette which the mgr recommended was extremely full of garlic. I could pick large chunks out. Next we chose the grilled vegetables which my boyfriend believed must have been from a frozen bag since he works for a restaurant and knows the difference-however these were not bad. After that I got frutta del mar which is clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari with lunguini. Very OK-I "
"I had to give it one star, because I can't figure out how to give it zero. I wish I'd had the great experience these other diners had. This is the second restaurant I have walked out of in my life, and I've been eating out in fine and casual restaurants all over the world 2-3 times a week for 20 years. I communicated to the restaurant 4 (four, cuatro) times that my husband didn't eat pork or shellfish and that I had NO restrictions. Yet for the second scallop course I was served tofu, just like him. I'd like my scallop, please. Then for the third course (which arrived one hour and ten minutes after the second course, even though the table next to us was getting served regularly) I got a square inch of crab and spaetzle and carrots, and he got spaetzle and carrots with the little square of "
"Wilde has always been one of my favorite places for dinner, but their Sunday brunch was always just a little bit lacking. ��However, after a major overhaul of their Brunch menu, they have completely outdone themselves. ��With a new 'design your own' style of omelette, and some of the most beautiful, and tasty entrees - you are certain to find something that you will just love. ��Many others restaurant-goers have become aware of their new gastronomic creations and Wildes is once again packed with happy, satisfied customers, which does tend to slow down the food just a little, but they so kindly offered delicious cinnamon-sugar muffins to tie us over for the wait. ��Everything we had was phenomenal, and I'll definitely be adding Wilde to my new Sunday Brunch locale of choice."
"Good place... but better than Fogo? I don't know about that. I've only been here once so my review is based on only one visit (i've been to Fogo many times). Regardless of which you go to, you won't be disappointed at Brazzaz though. They have great food and solid service."
"There was nothing very special about the restaurant, and although the lobster ravioli I ordered was pretty good the portion size was awful! ��Too pricey for what you get...I won't be going back, there's plenty more Italian places in the city."
The food is awesome and the staff is very friendly! I highly recommend trying the carmalized bananas they are amazing!
"Great place, excellent food, elegant atmosphere and beyond friendly service. Been here multiple times and keep coming back, because you really feel welcomed here, plus there's never been even one disappointment with the food. It is always exceptional! Seabass is my recommendation, also veal is always very tender. The bread pudding for desert is a must!"
"I love this place. ��I miss it, as I've recently moved. ��But it was so beautiful to see Nana's in Bridgeport. ��The prices were decent for the excellent food you get. ��Plus the service was always great."
"The best Greek food in Chicago...I always use them for parties and everyone is always impressed with the presentation and quality of their food. Great gyros, pastitsio, moussaka, salads, soups, breads...I could go on, and on...highly recommend them, especially for catering."
"Ack! ?Another girl, another highly mediocre vegetarian restaurant. ?And like the other old standbys, I live in hope that, in the past 40 years or whatever, they managed to find a recipe or two that doesn't taste like sawdust. ?Alas, wrong again.Look, there are going to be people who find a restaurant that suits their minority and say let's support Restaurant X because it 's [vegetarian|Kosher|West African|whatever] and I think that's great. ?But shouldn't the restaurant be _good_ too? ?I mean, shouldn't they at least _try_ not to suck? ?Well, they sure make their money, so maybe they found a business model that works for them... mediocre food, lousy service, atmosphere that shows that they just don't care, and, they're making moolah hand-over-fist. ?An American success story.Success or not"
"The first time I went to Brazzaz I had turned 17 and was with the family. I think this place is the best because its all you can eat, but you never have to leave your seat food is brought to you by manny of staff members. this place is a lil expensive but is deffinetly worth every dollar. the food is fairly exotic and taste great, because its always hot. I deffinetly think its worth a trip to Chicago. so go have fun its a great experience."
"I've lived in the South Loop area for years and Yolk is a welcome addidtion. It has a cool funky modern esthetic. But more than its good looks is the awesome food...you have to try the cinnamon roll french toast...yum.......be prepared to wait a bit in line outside on the wekends because its a popular place. Its well worth it though. Who knows, maybe you will bump into a neighbor and get to chat."
Best BYOB Italian in miles.
"Love it! ��The beer selection is fabulous, as are the mussels and frites! ��The garlic aioli is amazing as well..... along with almost everything else I have tried.... ��I wish we lived closer (although then I might be overweight and have drinking problem)... My only criticism would be their popularity.... (and the wait and noise that often goes along with that)...."
We went here last weekend and you would think with this weather and the location of this place it would be busy. ��I think this bar looks the part but its not quiet there yet. ��For having an open roof top they should be busier. ��Decent place for happy hour I guess.
"So yummy. I'm slowly working my way through the menu, but I love the nachos and the soul bowl too much to stray. The vegan shakes make a delicious dessert."
"The first and still the best of the Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants. ��The wait can be terrible, but the food is great, the service is great, and the music, um... ROCKS. ��If you don't care what your waist line is going to look like when you're 80, go for the bleu cheese burger and the malts. ��If you *do* care, you probably already know about that salad bar. ��WOOF!I'd normally mark it down to 4 because the wait really *is* dreadful, but Grunts is everything I love about Chicago. ��It's quirky. ��It's weird. ��It's fabulous. ��The quality is top-notch. ��The prices are good. ��And, it's locally owned and it's not something you see in every town from Maine to California. ��So, if it takes 45 minutes, I suppose it's because everyone knows that it's worth it. ��So, yeah. ��5 Stars!"
"Brazzaz is a food lover's heaven. Everything about this place is amazing the decor, the service, and especially the food. All the meats were delicious and the salad bar alone could provide a five-star meal. Matter of fact my mouth is watering just think of the experience. Although (per my waiter) Fogo del Chao and Brazzaz are owned by the same people, Brazzaz is 10 times better. I dear to say this is the best Brazilian Steakhouse in Chicago."
"He loses a star for not being open 1/2 the time I go there. other then that, it rules!"
"I went to Sun Wah last weekend and had a horrific time. ��Gawh! ��Everything was ok at first. ��The table and dinnerware looked nice. ��Our waiter came right away and ordered our drinks. ��I had a dry martini. ��Drinks not to bad sort of stiff. ��Then the waiter cam back, and kept banging his knee on the table while we were ordering. ��Practically shaking the table. ��I ordered duck soup, and the waiter gave the table a big BANG with his knee. ��He went back in the kitchen and brought back three duck soups. ��The soup was really cold and smelled like diapers."
Happy Thursday! Only night I found dancing there.Also saw Vince Vaughn. Hmm.
"A steakhouse should be able to serve PERFECT steak and potatoes. Ruth's delivered on the meat--beautifully cooked to order, well-seasoned and succulent. This was preceded by a perfect salad--cool, crisp ��with its rich blanket of blue cheese dressing. ��The seasoning in the potatoes was not to my liking, but not the fault of the restaurant. I guess I just don't like seasoned potatoes.I, unlike the unscrupulous reviewers on YELP - that should not be allowed to post reviews - would never lower the star rating for a business because I don't care for a particular item they sell, when the item is was prepared perfectly, and when others obviously do like it.I think people who do this, like Steve S. (http://www.yelp.com/user��_), should be banned from YELP.HEY STEVE S., DON'T PUNISH THE RESTAURANT JU"
One of my favorite restaurants ever! ?I've been twice and had the tasting menu both times. ?The first time I was completely floored at the amazing variety of items they brought out. ?It was almost too much food. ?Almost. ?The second time we ordered our favorites from the tasting menu and some additions.My Favorites:*Anything A la plancha - the wagyu beef skirt steak is amazing as are the shrimp.*The amazing salad that comes wrapped in serrano ham...*Bacon wrapped dates in blue cheese fondue*The to die for butternut squash dumplingsThe presentation is amazing and the service is great if you engage your server and ask what is the best new thing.I want to go on their once a month outing/lunch with the head chef ?to the green market here in Chicago. ?I'll let you know how that experience goes.
"Hands down, favorite place in Chicago to grab delicious drinks and conversation."
"really awesome. fine dining is down to an art. a well tuned machine as far as service and presentation went. each course was either well crafted, great tasting, interestingly tasting, and at least just really intriguing. that being said, you are never really bored with any of the courses set before you. this is about the art of food, not about how much you get, its not about one dish or a specialty dish. its pushing the boundaries of what other establishments would call food. do your homework. plan for this experience. eat everything. get the wine pairing. the last thing i wanna say,,,,this is a pretty pricey dinner and one should not try to get this done on the cheap. however, you are almost treated as if you are cherished when you are here. its as if the staff is well aware that the gues"
"Geja's is quite hidden but is often crowded. ��I personally don't like it when a restaurant and people filled with it from wall to wall, but this place was nice. ��Geja's does have a very relaxed ambient romantic feel to it. ��My waiter was super friendly, nice, and accommodating. ��The fondue was great and the bar was good too. ��The only reason why I don't go there more often is the prices! ��But other than that, great!"
"Didnt even wait around to pay an absorbent price for meat-less meatloaf. You could cook any of this food at home, why tolerate the ABUSIVE service. I was REFUSED service because I was checking my voicemails on my cell phone, waitress, and waiter were both so RUDE that I left despite the hype this place has. In my ten years at eating out in chicago i have NEVER experienced a more rude of an experience than I had at the chicago diner. Not even at the weiners circle could you experience such condescending levels of nastiness to patrons, from smug wannabe hippies. Grab your fixed gear, and your colored bandanas and please ride off into the sunset, these types of staff and establishment are ruining our fair city.-the food allergist(eating healthy for more important reasons than you are.)"
"What a disappointment! If I could give zero stars I would. My boyfriend and I ate here last year for my birthday. We absolutely loved everything about it. ��During the past year, we've been back several times to have a bottle of wine and their great appetizers at the bar. (love the bartender, btw). ��We decided to dine here to celebrate this year's birthday. ��We couldn't believe how terrible it was! First we ordered a glass of champagne, and the waiter brings it in red wine glasses. He says that's how they serve it. Not so on the previous occasions we've drunk it there. ��As you can imagine, any nuances in the wine were lost. It was like gulping down alcoholy-tasting soda. Next we ordered appetizers--grilled shrimp on greens, and potatoes with olives and rosemary. We couldn't eat the greens t"
"Bin 36, what happened to you. ��I used to go to this place all the time, and would have rated it 4 maybe even 5 stars. Now? ��2 stars and that is just because of Nostalgia. ��There was almost no one else in the place, (first sign that something was wrong). ��The service was not very attentive, even though the server could not have had more that one other table. ��The food was merely ok, not as good as it used to be, I once had an Osca Bocca that was to die for, but not anymore. ��The bathroom was very dirty and dusty with missing tiles and one of the sinks in the ladies room was broken. ��All the signs of a restaurant that has given up and cannot afford basic upkeep any more. ��Very sad because I used to love this place."
"Having been coming here for over 10 years, while glad RB is cashing in on the business, I have found the increasing crowds oppressive. With the no/minimal reservations policy still in effect, the wait I was told over the weekend was 2-3 hours. I mean give me a break. It is basically all gawkers and tourists now who go and will wait b/c they will not be back in town. The food is good, authentic, and delicious...but certainly not worth more than an hour wait. I think they may even be trying to scare people off with overblown estimated wait times, just to move the tourists through faster. If you are a Chicago area resident, only go during the week if you want to get in a reasonable time. Otherwise, the new Xoco is a fine alternative...even if the wait there is 30+ min as well for a sandwich."
"If I could I would give negative stars to this place;I went with 8 friends (we make our own wines and share them at B.Y.O.B.s) and after paying ��$90.00 ��each( $85.00 +$5.00 corkage) we all went somewhere else to eat because ��7 of us ��were still hungry (one lady was full,she weights 90lbs.) �� ��There was no help with our wines: we paid to open our owe bottles they did not get us a wine chiller for our open bottles(they included corkage and TAXES in the predetermined tip. �� �� The food was good new and interesting but extremely overpriced and we went away hungry. ��There's many better B.Y.O.B. s ��in Chicago."
This is a great place!!!Very romantic and unique. Only thing I didnt like was price....cost od one meal was around $40-50 it is maybe little to much
"Too much grease, butter, fat in gnocchi. I could only eat a third of my plate. When I nukes left overs, a pool of oil appeared and each gnocchi I picked up was dripping in oil/butter. The plate was easily 5,000 calories. Fresh garlic served with bread. Yes, tastes nice as long as you are going straight home alone. The dessert was nice....a mango gelatin that was surprisingly light. The only thing that stood out. Nice servers but completely un-impressive."
"Ive been living in Logan Square for about 4 years now, and I can finally say that I have found a place that I would like to call home. ��The food is incredible. ��I recommend trying to pork belly served on (I believe) a pumpkin risotto. ��Also, there were more whiskey selections than I could even count. ��Ridiculous. ��Also, they have a juke box that plays 45's. ��I cannot remember the last time I saw one of those. ��I could go on and on. ��But you seriously need to try this place for yourself. ��I love it and so will you."
"Something I have never had before and everyone should try, Costa Rican food! ��There were so many wonderful looking dishes that I have to go back and try others, you can BYOB (love it) and the service was great. Definately ready to go back and try some more yummy dishes."
We've dine there & have them delivery for several times. Their services & the staff are better than we expected. We really likes the food there & it's inexpensive (just what we needed for these days). What suprise us the most are...sometimes they even gave us some complimentary food and drinks just for being their customers!
Food is fantastic! Atmosphere is chill. Service is the best!My wife and I agree that this is our favorite restaurant.

"Dear Yelpers,This restaurant takes an advantage on foreigners and doesn't serve all the condiments that supposed to come with the entrees. BBQ short ribs are the most popular items on the menu. They will not allow you to cook a single order BBQ on the table. Instead they cook them in the kitchen and bring those out to you. It's just one of the ways to push you to buy two orders and make sales. Also, when they cook inside the kitchen, they use the oldest marinated meat. Be aware!They jacked up the price, yet food got stinkier. No wonder you don't see many Asians or Koreans. It used to be place, but not anymore. Don't go there, its not worth it."
Visited Sunda on my 1st trip to Chicago and I must say- I can't wait to go back! The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. Our waiter was ��knowledgeable and well trained on the extensive menu options. The food was amazing!! ��Don't be fooled by the atmosphere and local chains. The service is warm and inviting. The general manager even came over to our table to check on how our night was going and welcomed us properly to Chicago!
"Gag, gag, gag! I was so excited before going to this restaurant because I read such good reviews. ��It turns out there is little to be excited about. ��The food is tasteless, little portions, and nothing to rave about. ��Its flavorless and overpriced! ��Please, please, please save your money and go elsewhere because this place will leave you sorely disappointed."
"really good restaurant, ate way too much but that's probably the point. Parking was pretty easy and gave us enough time to stop by wildfire next door for a martini after dinner. The plan then also was to stop by Martini Park but alas is closed. All things considered these days a restaurant has to be REALLY good to warrant a return (with the abundance of options in Chicago) though and Fogo was certainly good enough to be back again."
"One star for the food, which is on the right side of mediocre. ��One star for the fabulous lavender cookies. ��You heard, lavender, which turns out is a part of the peppermint family and it plays so nicely on your palette after a meal. ��Minus 3 stars for the service - horrible.The layout in general is pretty bad, you order at the counter then hope and pray for a table, the line is usually out the door, which i could deal with if after waiting in that line i didn't have to deal with this:counter chick: whadayawant?me: um... (looking at the menu that is posted on the wall and NOT visible when you're in line) counter chick: ��seriously? ��just pick something, everything is good.me (seeking any sign of humor on her face and finding none): ok, i'll take the huevos rancheros.counter chick: ��great. ��"
"I love Milk and Honey for Sunday brunch. Even though it's a tiny space, tables turn quickly and you can have a mimosa at the bar while waiting. ��Interesting, great food and friendly staff. What else can I say? One of my faves."
I love this Place. The sushi is a bit more pricey but the quality is suberb. ��Its def BYOB and quaint but that works for me. It's a nice place for an intimate gathering. I would definately be returning.
"Wow! What a great dinner I had tonight! The food was delicious but the service was exceptional. I can't remember the last time I had such attentive service. My friends and I arrived early in the evening. Even as the room began filling up, the staff never left you wanting or needing anything. I highly recommend Brazzaz. I will definitely be returning. Although no time too soon, as i will be full for days!! Thank you David and staff!"
"Yeah so this place is ridic. I've been coming here my whole life, with friends, family, dates, for breakfast, lunch or dinner, and it never disappoints. I'm not a particularly picky eater, but my family is, and when we have relatives visit from Mexico this is the first place we take them. And everyone loves it. The Carne asada is my absolute favorite, but seriously anything on the menu is legit.I kind of wish it had a better ambiance, but whatever, we're there to eat not stare at the walls, right? Good company and BYOB creates all the ambiance one needs anyways.If you have a choice I'd recommend sitting in the back room. The front room gets kind of loud and space is tight, especially when a line forms. I hate waiting in that line, feeling like I'm hovering over someone while they eat. And "
I loved it every minute.
"This place used to be my go to lunch place. ��But the quality of food as well as the quality of customer service seems to have really gone down hill. The customer service isn't horrible, the people aren't mean, they just aren't knowledgeable of their own restaurant. The one girl that had her shit together must not work here anymore, haven't seen her. ��Guess I'll stick to potbelly for lunch."
Food was delicious. Came in from out of town so I haven't experienced chinese food this way. Impressed for sure.
"I was impressed with the service and the food. ?The price is extremely reasonable given the menu offering. ?We had the pork fried almonds (which were passed out to hungry people waiting for a seat - very nice touch), the shrimp and clams, the deviled egg, the french fries of the sea, the marrow, the pork blade, and fried brioche. ?All excellent courses, my favorite pig items being a toss between french fries and the pork blade.The dining atmosphere/area is a wonderful concept - diners share long tables and this creates an environment where diners interact with other parties and talk about what their favorite dishes are, what are you ordering...etc. ?Wait staff is knowledgeable and well versed in both the drink/wine and food menus.My only complaint (and the reason why I did not give it five"
"Whole chicken dinner (with two sides, 1 - garlic rice with black beans and bacon, 2 - corn) was about 13 bucks. ��I added a small order of the Bocci Balls (wellington meatballs that are breaded, along with marinara sauce) because they are DELICIOUS and two coxinhas, which is a ball of pulled chicken fried up in a cornmeal breading. ��22 bucks, dinner for two, excellent."
"I love the atmosphere and the food!! ��They have a delicious Greek salad, which I would highly recommend. ��I also think their Fried Calamari is the best around."
"I had a wonderful birthday brunch at Big Jones today. ��The food was amazing and the waiter was very attentive.The service wasn't fast, so be prepared for a slow paced meal and rest assured that the meal will be worth it! ��Our party tried the Eggs New Orleans, Corn Cakes, and the burger and they were all fantastic. ��And the beignets were the best I've ever had!"
fantastic hot dog joint you dont even have to get out of your car!!i had a chocolate melt loved it my b/f had some type of hot dog he was in awe parking is kind of tight being so busy but worth the wait
Great chopped salad!!!
"the food is definately delicious. i had the blueberry cheesecake pancakes and was hooked.the only downside is that it's incredibly expensive for breakfast food, probably due to it's hipster atmosphere. while you get fresher and fancier meals than just a regular diner, you will pay for it. my entre was a little over $8.00, and the sides aren't that cheap either.if price is no issue, then you can't go wrong. just make sure you call ahead, the last time i was there i think there were about 15 people waiting outside for a table."
"Went to hopleaf on a date a few weeks ago and was really impressed. ��GREAT selection of beers and the female bartender was really nice in helping us make our decisions. ��The menu was very original, compared to other bar & restaurants in the city. ��We shared the Belgian mussels for two with a side order of fries. ��YUMMY! ��Only downside: the 45 min wait... then again, with such a great beer selection who's complaining?! Date or no date, I'll definitely be back."
"I had my birthday dinner there with about 15 of my friends the other night. Everything was perfect! The food was amazing and our waiter was so attentive! He was ��sure to always check with me to make sure I was enjoying myself since I was the birthday girl. Even with such a big group, the atmosphere made the dinner really intimate. Many of my friends had never eaten at Indie Cafe before, so I was so glad to share this gem with them. No negative feedback from anyone in my group! Awesome food reasonably priced. BYOB tops it all off! We will all be back again and again."
"I had lunch at The Gage with a group of 8. ?This was my first time there, and needless to say, we all loved it. ?The food was better than expected given that most pub food is mediocre at best. ?The special sandwich, a braised beef rib sandwich with greens, swiss and thinly sliced granny smith apple on a pretzel roll was the big winner. ?The service was a perfect match for the food. ?Our waiter was attentive and very nice. ?The beer selection was outstanding, including some nice Belgian ales as well as some domestic higher end selections. ?The decor was a nice combination of old world feel dark woods and more modern glass subway tiles. ?We sat in the rear next to the kitchen, but were not disturbed by sounds or smells from the kitchen. ?Highly recommend, even if a little on the pricey side "
"We came in for dinner a couple nights ago and ��they were packed. I mean there was an actual line! The owner was nice, and we were pretty grateful. He had given everyone waiting on a table eggrolls and dumplings. By the time we got seated, the food was fast and the service was great. I do apologize because we did sit until they closed and the owner looked oh so tired but told us we may sit there until we want to leave. I decided to come back for lunch. I came in yesterday and they were quite busy. That's good to see. The food is still wonderful. And the prices during lunch is even better. Plus you get so much food. I love the fact that I could leave here always full.I'm figuring that this place is great to throw parties. I might just make a reservation for my sister's graduation. Figuring b"
"How can you treat people like trash and still exist?Build your clientele of desperate, approval-seeking lonely folks who have a masochistic streak? That's the only way I can see someone justifying patronage to this BAD JOKE of a bar.Ok, ok, we get it. The bouncer is an a**hole who won't make eye contact or acknowledge anyone. I get it, the bartenders/servers are WAY too busy serving their 2 other, much more important customers. Waiting 35 minutes to order once you're in is the norm! YOU'RE LUCKY TO JUST BE THERE, RIGHT?Seriously. If I had self-esteem issues I'd love this place. But I would rather just drink in a nice quiet place with friends."
This is one of the best restaurants. I have never had a bad meal. There is something there to satisfy everyones personal taste. ��If you like to eat then Fogo is paradise. I only wish the price would be lower.. but it's well worth it for those that eat a lot.
good american food (especialy the burger) --- the beignets are great also --- be sure to ask for the window seating looking out to michigan avenue since it has the best view (especially if you are trying to get lucky with your date) --- plenty of space --- i would have given them 4 stars if they took reservations because there is always a wait.everyone deserves chances so i will occasionally re-visit establishments that did not get favorable reviews from me in hope that they have addressed the issues and will revise my views accordingly
it was good but very expensive for the portion sizes
"It's true...the falafel here is very good. And so is the chicken shawirma dinner, which is what I usually get every couple weeks or so on my way home. Food's good, prices are more than reasonable, and I can be in and out in under 5 mins (unless there's a long line). I also end up here a lot if I'm hanging out with vegetarian friends. Makes everyone happy. Definitely a neighborhood gem."
"We dined at Graham Elliot on Friday, March 26. ��The food was amazing. ��The chef must be a genius. ��The food flavors, textures and presentations were superb. ��The carrot cake dessert was one of the best desserts I've eaten at any restaurant. ��My only complaint was the portion size of all menu items. ��Definitely try this restaurant. ��LBO"
"I am always amazed that Nuevo Leon has such a strong following. As a lifelong Mexican Food aficionado, IMHO the food at NL is not just bad, it is horrible. There are no redeeming qualities to this restaurant. I believe that it is successful because many are unfamiliar with real mexican food and/or have such low expectations of mexican restaurants. Every couple of years, I am compelled to give Nuevo Leon another try because so many folks rave about the place. Yet, on my last visit, ?a bland tasteless salsa was brought out (we even witnessed salsa, after a customer left, being put back by the waiter into a large bowl, only to be scooped up again to be served anew; yuck!), the chips were soggy, greasy and tasteless, and there was an energizer battery in the soup (yes, this happened to us!). N"
their fat fries are AMAZING... definitely try this place!
"It smells bad - very bad , its dark - very dark, food is tasteless. The tables are dirty. I will not go back"
"Finally made it in to Schwa, on somebody ELSE's reservation as I refuse to try any more. ��This was after having dined recently at Alinea, Manresa, some other amazing places. ��My response: yes creative and dramatic, but without complexity, cohesiveness or focus. ��It felt like they were trying so hard to make the food unusual that no one taste was really amazing, and nothing made sense with what came before it. ��Anybody who compares this place to Alinea needs to go back, as it is nowhere near the same level, or at least admit that they are largely responding to the difference in price. ��And as goes without saying, my vist was marked by plenty of attitude from the staff. ��If this were really the casual neighborhood place they are pretending to be, I might give a better review, but compared to"
So very good. Will return!!!!
"When you are ready to turn back the clock and head to the era of wild game and caveman-ly eats, Longman and Eagle brings gourmet to the hunter/gatherer community. ��Bone marrow and onion jelly followed by wild boar sloppy joes will make sure you are packed full of fat, calories, and nutrients until the next hunting party. ��Drinks are solid, staff is generally friendly, just make sure you don't need to fit into a tight dress the next day."
Visited Shaw's for sushi. ��Service was ok. ��Food was ok. ��Nothing to write home about. ��Average sushi and there are better places within walling distance.
"I really want to give 4 stars for the ambiance of this place alone, but taking in account the food I'd have to say its just ok. I had the flat iron steak with potatoes. When my dish came I wondered where the veggies were but remembered that the choice was either potatoes or veggies. So i cant get my bit of ""healthy"" on without paying extra for veggies or a potato?Huh?! Where do they do this?! At Grand Lux! At apple bees (which is what my meal reminded me of) you can get potatoes and veggies in a meal. You dont have to choose either/or. Why not here at such a nice place? My husband had BBQ chicken which was good but it really tasted no diff than what he does on the grill at home. On another note: I was celebrating my bday in Chicago this weekend so my husband snuck and told them. Heads up: "
"Piece looks like a great place, can't wait to go! ��New Haven-style thin crust & a brewery, with live band karaoke on Saturday nights. ��Checkout the Piece writeup on http://www.WhatTeddSedd.��_"
"friendly place, excellent service, interesting and unusual menu. Food was well prepared and presented. ��A bit pricey, but what do you expect?"
I had a great time at this restaurant. The flaming cheese is delicious & so is the salmon. The owner came by and went out of his way to make sure my date & I had a fabulous time.
"Delivery woman was so kind - the soup is huge - and they labeled EVERYTHING! So helpful and thoughtful! Also, a free sliced orange was included. Delightful."
"Among the best beer bars in the city. Folks, don't come here and ask for a light beer...that's just silly. Especially since Simon's and other joints are up the street, just begging for your Bud Lite business. The food is unique and quite filling."
"I love it. Lots of flavor and style! ��I'll keep this review simple and short. It's everything and more from what you'd expect from any brazilian steak house in a big city, but one thing holds it from being 5 stars for me. ��Tourists. But whatever."
"This place is the bomb. ��I recommend the asparagus gold appetizer....sooooo delicious! ��The sushi is amazing as well, as are their noodle dishes. ��My bf and I usually share a few rolls, then split the pad thai and find it to be MORE than enough food. ��BYOB is also a plus"
"This place is good for fast, cheap vegan. I found the service to be a bit slow, and the tables are so close together you are in everyone else's convos, a bit annoying. If you are looking for excellent vegan, try Karyn's on the Green, now that is quality!"
I'm a big superdawg fan. ��I love a Chicago hotdog. ��Combined with the ambience of outdoor parking ordering and having it delivered to your car. ��Life just doesn't get better. ��I've been coming here since I was a teenager.
My wife and I enjoyed our experience. ��Server was professional and the food tasted great. ��Good place for an anniversary dinner.
Very good thin crust pizza. ��Deliver booze til 3am rock on!
My wife and I frequent the Mayan Palace fairly regularly and unfortunately our great dinner was overshadowed by an unpleasant experience at the end of our night. A young lady who identified herself as the owners daughter yelled at me and two other patrons outside of the restrooms. She was eating a full dinner at the bar during dinner service and didn't like that the two gentlemen in line in front of me were discussing using the restroom. I suggested that maybe she shouldn't be eating within a couple feet of the restrooms during a busy dinner service but she wouldn't hear of it. She was quite rude an I was embarrassed for her. It seems like daddy's girl has a lot to learn about the restaurant business. There are too many great Mexican restaurants in Chicago to put up with that nonsense.
"I have gone to las tablas at least 8 times since i have lived in chicago. I do have to admit, their older spot across the street was MUCH better. It was much more cozy and had a really nice ""family style"" feel to it.now let's get to the newer spot....I was there on a Monday night not too long ago and it was dead. Our table of 2 and two more tables of 2. We ordered the empanadas and they were good as usual. The server took forever to come back to get our order. We then gave him our order and it took over a half hour for the food to get there (two steaks). Server never filled our waters and never came back to check on us. We tried to flag him down for our check but he disappeared. It took him almost 15 minutes after we ate to get our check. If you don't serve your customers, they wont come b"
"Besides the aforementioned French toast, the Bongo Room also does wonders in the egg department, culminating in magnificent, albeit somewhat less creative, omelets. The breakfast burrito with cilantro, jalapenos and scallions is a gooey work of art which, when combined with the croissant sandwich, covers almost every breakfast item in the northern hemisphere (muenster cheese and hollandaise anyone?). Not a bad catch for $8.95. Fun specials such as the raspberry lemon pancakes may be a bit too sweet for some, but the Bongo Room's excellent coffee works as a nice counterbalance."
Great munch out food. The burgers and nachos were delicious. The location is kind of tucked away near the LP zoo.
"Well, the food was ok I guess. The Pad Kee Maow was way too salty for me, but the Pad Thai was pretty good. The waitress wasnt super friendly but got us what we needed. Maybe Ill give them another try if Im in that part of town."
"Went twice. Got sick both times. Service was terrible both times. Would not recommend to ANYONE. ��If you want great mexican food and good service, just head to Tapatio instead."
Two words: Cheese Fries. Do it. Don't even think about it just order them. ��Overall the food is great here and our server was very friendly. It WAS crowded but not enough that I was bothered by it. I would definitely go here again.
The Burrito Suizo Ranchero was great!! The structure of the building is good and cleanliness.But i have to agree with the other reviews the service was horrible..after attempting to tell the waiter what we order she rolled her eyes and walked off.you have to flag them down in order to get a refill..Good food bad service...I would defiantly go back for a burrito TOGO!!!! and pick up some green salsa from somewhere else or make my own....
I like this place!Greek Island has the best Greek food in Chicago...this is my favorite Greek rastaurant.Greek Style Lamb is maybe the best entree I have ever tasted
"You get variety, quantity, and quality! They feed you great steaks so much that you don't want to eat beef for a while after the meal! The salad bar is great too!With price easily tops $100 per person with drinks and tips, it's a pleasure you can have once in a long while..."
"I check the specials on the web even when I'm out of town and have no way of getting there. ��I recommend getting the Game of the Week (even if it is an alligator sausage or rattlesnake or anything you've never heard of) and a second sausage. ��I also recommend getting the fries to split with your friends (even though they are outstanding, freshly made, and great when dipped in cheese).Be prepared to wait 45 minutes in line on a Saturday. Check the website if you plan to go - he closes, randomly, just because.If you don't like this place, I don't like you."
"Charming, Quiet, Unpretentious and nested away in Chicago's gold coast, what I adore most about the place is the relaxed and friendly environment. Never have I felt rushed to depart, that's a nice treat in my mind. Great place for close knit friends to converse, relax, maybe even pay chess and of course enjoy any meal of the day. Also super wonderful for enjoying some ME time reading a book over tea. If you are into soups, they're simply fab, I'm a fan of the black bean soup! Entrees are awesome, had a paste dish for dinner a few weeks back and totally hearted it ��Janet, the owner is super kind and crazy passionate about her place & people. She's also got a great memory, I haven't been in quite sometime, in the mist of dinner, she came over to say hello and remembered we had met. How cool "
"Waited 1hr in line, paid $13 for a sandwich. Result: size was enough for a kid only, the taste was ok, the bread was good. It's not worth the time and money. You just pay for the name of the chef."
"we need to get our vietnamese craving fix once in a while,i really like this place, the service might be ehh but the food is actually pretty fresh and good. it is always crowded at anytime of the day i feel like. we tried couple pho places and i think this place is one of the best!"
"We love hopleaf and have had a number of delishious visits. ��Stick to pub food, be ready to relax in a crowded bar while you wait. ��The staff are friendly and efficient. ��The beer listing is extensive, specialty glassware and all. ��Don't miss the mussels!"
Shaws is always excellent. The crab legs were phenomenal and my girlfriends grouper was fantastic...great service as well.
"Maybe I went here with too high of expectations. ��Maybe I wouldn't be so salty if dinner for two didn't cost $225, but this place was WAY below par. ��So SO disappointing. ��There was nothing special about the food, drinks, ambiance, anything. ��For sushi there are far better places with less ridiculous prices. ��For the money I'd MUCH rather go to Japonais or Sushi Samba. ��Too much hype over this place. ��I was disappointed."
"The Art of Pizza, hands down, makes the best pizza in all of Chicago. ��I absolutely love it, and it's affordable as well. ��I love you Art of Pizza!"
"HIGHLY recommend!!I've been going here a lot lately and love it, for many reasons.First, the menu is extensive and has something for everyone. I am a vegan and appreciate that there are options for me. ��Veggie burger, black bean burger, edamame salad, vegan soup, etc. �� And my carnivore friends like the burgers, chicken, salmon, etc. ��So many options!!! And good wine selection! Wonderful menu!!Second, the service and the staff are top notch, starting with the managers. ��A group of us went to Wilde on the show day recently. While the city was nearly completely shut down, Wilde was open and so enjoyable!! ��It was packed and they were way under staffed. ��But Chad, who is the manager, stepped in to be our server that day. ��He was so friendly, so fun, and offered fantastic service, despite the "
"I was slightly confused when I entered this Rivernorth hot spot as it imitated one of those dining gems you find in wicker park or buck town. It's definitely not your average swanky urban professional venue with loubou's and brooks brothers all over the place. I was pleased with the cozy atmosphere on the blistery snowy evening, but found the food (the reason for venturing out) to be somewhat bland and generic. I guess I was expecting robust flavors and interesting pairings which is what the rustic, prohibition vibe implies. Not sure if i'd go back for a dining experience..."
"The food was great. ��We went with 6 people and they honored our reservation immediately. ��The thing I didn't like was that as soon as we sat down they handed us these large menus. ��That was before they asked if we wanted a drink. ��It made us all feel like we were being rushed to look at the menu, place an order, eat and leave. ��We were there to dine and have a relaxing evening. ��My advice to them would be to let us settle in with a drink or bottle of wine and then ask if we are ready to look at the menu."
I was behind two other groups of people who had just entered the door before me. ?Once each group was seated I was denied a table and told that the restaurant closes at 2:00pm. ?(It was now only a minute after 2:00pm). ?I had another table of friends at the restaurant and their waitress was going to allow me to sit with them and order but the owner came running over to the table and said I already told her No. ?Even though another couple was just being sat at the bar and handed menus at the same moment I was still denied service.I have always loved this restaurant in the past and have sent so many people in who are now regulars but after this discriminatory act which I was told is Nothing Personal I will not be back and will ask my friends to also abandon the Bongo Room because of the poor
"Definitely the most authentic Cuban food in Chicago. All the dishes are very authentic and does feel like mi abuela made them. I didn't try the sandwiches, but the dinners were nice. Black beans were not the best I've had in Chicago, but all the sides, like Yuca, Tostones, Maduros, and Croquetas were spot on. Steak was ok - your typical pounded Cuban steak, Lechon was the strongest dinner dish. Bread pudding was outstanding. The milkshakes are ok - a little more creamy than fruity. I can see why everyone likes the owner, he's pretty nice, and gave out Cuban coffee to everyone. A nice touch. There is a sort of weird Cuban or want to be Cuban groupie thing going on there, but its fine if you don't know what I'm talking about. =)"
If you like uppidity duppity with a side of complete disgusting food go here.
"We had a booking for 10pm, which was the only slot we could get on short notice, but had to wait a little while for tables to clear. The piano bar was going off at this point, and we waited in that area for a while, but the singing was a bit over the top if you weren't already half drunk. We weren't, and sniggered happily at the raucous crowd.Portion sizes were generally huge, and our waitress proactively split the orders for us, which was both helpful and - as it turned out - necessary.We had:Shrimp cocktail - not at all what I was expecting - large shelled prawns in a tomato and chilli jam, presented with ?dry ice? forming a mist over the top. Cold, tasty, good prawns.Lobster bisque which was generously portioned, with tasty lobster and a slightly sweet (not overwhelmingly so) bisque.Ice"
"If you wanna put an encased piece of meat in your body, this is the place to start.Likes: ��There is an excellent selection of creative sausages that are priced fairly, and served quickly. ��The fries are good for what they are (the fresh cut variety often get greasier and it makes my aging stomach angry). ��Dislikes: ��There are several, hence the 3 stars. ��It is located in a pretty inconvenient spot for people sans cars, and the hours are so limited that there is always a long line to place your order. ��It's hard to imagine a well established business like Hot Doug's still only accepting cash. �� Many neighborhood places do it so that they can avoid city taxes (which are disproportionately high for small businesses), but this just seems like hard-headedness. ��If you have a couple of hours (li"
"Quite possibly my favorite restaurant in the entire city. I first started going here at a kid when my family lived in Lincoln Park and hadn't been back for several years, but now that I live in the area again, I go on a regular basis.I've tried many of the entrees, but the club sandwich is easily one of the best -- I really like clubs and get them frequently at restaurants and their club is usually made with real turkey meat (i.e. not processed) which is rarity in town. The pulled pork sandwich is fabulous, and the burgers are great too. You really can't go wrong with just about anything on the menu.The salad bar is awesome -- great selection of veggies, fruit, and the usual stuff you find on a salad bar, as well as a couple of soup choices to go along with the salad. Also, the chocolate c"

"Ok-I've eaten here several times. ��With a few mistakes with service, I have come back for the food.This time, I don't know if I'll be back.Maybe it's different when the owner is there.Even though I called ahead, there still was a wait for a table, even though we were all there and there were 4 open tables???So, a few spots opened at the bar, so we decided to sit there. ��The host was elated..We did bring our own wine. ��We waited a bit for glasses and a bucket. ��WE GOT NO WATER THE ENTIRE TIME AT THE BAR!!! ��NEVER OFFERED!!!!!NO BREAD!!!!

"Long wait, good food. The dishes are unique and rich, not your typical eggs and toast."
Went here with a huge group for my birthday and again for a friends birthday. This place is amazing. Service was exceptional both times and the food is etherial. It's a do-not-miss foodie location in Chicago. It also isn't terribly expensive and BYOB. The empanadas are wonderful and so are the entrees.
"Man...oh... Man! ��What a great place. ��I *heart* this place! ��My friend from work found this place when she was traveling on one of her conferences and insisted I go if I ever went to Chicago. ��So the first chance I got to travel to Chicago, I made my boyfriend take me here. ��It was AMAZING. ��The ambiance is very nice, we were seated in a long table with some random people and were able to ask them what they were eating and how they liked it. ��We tried the Salt Roasted Beets, the eggplant, various cheeses and oodles and oodles of wine! The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about wine. ��Last week I made my boyfriend take me here again and we discovered the rillette (pork shoulder) and finally got the crispy pig ears! ��We sat at the bar this time since we were able to find bar s"

"Andre's already written his part so I'll try to stick to what I had.

However, I did some time in NOLA for grad school and long enough to meet my beau. I miss Saturday afternoons at Mother's and Zapp's potato chips.

"This is one of my favorite spots to grab a bite, but it's ALWAYS busy so there is usually a line. The dine in section is very small and only seats about 25 people so sometimes its better to take it to go. Services is fast, but like I said they are always busy. The tortas are delicious. My favorite is the Milanesa! The Churros taste so fresh and top off a great meal. Occasionally, you will see Rick Bayless pop in from time-to-time, he's very friendly and makes sure everyone is satisfied."
"This place has everything! Great food, awesome atmosphere, helpful and friendly staff.My boyfriend and I had a Cuban and steak sandwiches, along with an empanada. The sandwiches were fantastic! And the empenada was fresh and delicious.The waiter as well as the manager made sure we were happy and also informed us of an upcoming event at the restaurant. You can tell they are all about service and quality.90 Miles is a must eat and I know I'll be back many more times very soon."
"I had an amazing experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely superb...the service was great, the ambiance had a very pan-Asian, New York-like style and it's definitely a place to see and be seen. Every dish I tried, which was nearly everything on the menu, due to being with a group, ��was absolutely amazing: rich in flavor, exquisite presentation and left me wanting more, but I didn't have any room left. The service was great--although the space is very open, the staff made me feel very welcome. I encourage people to try this restaurant--I love it and everyone that I was with shared the same experience! Oh! and don't forget, they now offer brunch--the french toast with carmelized bananas is amazing! Other dishes to die for on the regular menu are the spicy tuna rolls, pork shank,"
"We were in town for the NRA show last week and had one of the worse experiences I have encountered in a long time. We made a reservation 6 weeks prior to the show, knowing that restaurants would be booked for the weekend. Saturday afternoon, they called to confirm our reservation for 7:00. We replied we would be there early to enjoy apps and cocktails in the bar. We arrived at 6:15 and checked at the front desk. To our surprise, we were told that we didn't have a reservation?? We mentioned that they had called to confirm earlier. The gentleman at the hostess stand(40,bow tie) asked us what our name was and phone number. We gave him the information and he said they didn't have us in his system. Being in the industry for over 30 years, i understand people try to lie and take advantage of res"
"Fun place, great to go anytime but particularly to take out of towners to. ��Favorite drink was definitely the coconut mojito."
"Wonderful food and very elegant! ��Perfect for dates or just a lovely night out! ��Try the cheese au gratin potatoes, they're amazing! ��Wonderful service!"
"I have been here twice now- The first time the bf and I went on a week night for my birthday after a long work day. ?We had the Chef's Selection but were able to let him know some things from the menu we would definitely like to try and that we were partial to seafood. ?It was a really great experience - modern and vibrant decor, attentive and knowledgeable service, and surprising and delicious food. ?I fell in love with the sardine dish. ?I didn't even know I liked them and I consider myself to be a pretty experienced eater. ?They also have a potato dish which consists of ?little heavenly tater tots. ?I have eaten a million shrimp in my life but was still delighted with the simple but sizzling garlic shrimp. ? We also had a great view of the park during sunset which was a nice bonus. ?I w"
"The existence of Superdawg proves that ��gimmicks ��sometimes works. Although, in my lonely opinion, the gigantic hotdogs are a bit cheeezy, Superdawg is the standard ��which I judge and compare all hotdogs to. Although I cannot explain what makes the hotdog so special -you have to try it for yourself- the french fries are just as awesome as the hotdogs. They are so crispy and so simple : salt + potato + oil = perfect french fry . Moreover the milkshakes are well balanced and tasty : they are not too sweet and heavy like most milkshakes yet it is satisfying; in other words, the milkshake doesn't overpower the hotdog, but complements it - I know this is an odd description, but this is true-. The decor is also good and I would highly recommend going at night when all the neon lights are on : it"
"Very disappointed. ��Waitsfaff was pleasant enough.. but that was the only good thing. ��Appetizer was extremely small, and I can make a better pizza at home. ��Seriously do not see what all the hoopla was/is about this place!"
"Really fun, excellent service, amazing food. We ordered every appetizer on the menu and the cheese sampler. We spread everything out over the course of the evening. I will go back for entrees. Many reviews complained of it being too loud. I was really worried about this and found it not to be an issue whatsoever. I was also worried this would be a tourist trap, but never felt that way. And, by the way, what is so wrong with being a suburban visitor?"
"Spicy falafel, served by sexy foreign men.Good, cheap ethnic eats."
"use to go .. it's a little too busy nowadays' but the people who run and own it are solid, great place good food great beers .. a for sure must, bring people you know, it's like the coffee shop of bars, but totally not anything like a coffee shop, it's a full out bar, sorry to confuse you.. but you get it.. your smart.. and you have all these other people here to help and guide your Chicago beer Revelation"
Fantastic Food and great atmosphere! ��The shrimp rolls were great as was the chicken satay I had. ��Phenomenal service as well. ��Highly recommended!
"We had a nice dinner at Fogo de Chao. The food and service were very good. Since we're not particularly big eaters, Brazilian steakhouses have never really been our thing and this one is no different. For people who like to eat lots of meat, this is a very good choice. The only real caution I would offer to people assuming that they know what they're getting into with a big bill in exchange for lots of quality meat is that it's not a particularly downtown Chicago kind of restaurant. If you're looking for something that will remind you you're in Chicago, this probably isn't it."
"interesting tastes, but does not strike this reviewer as entirely unique in either presentation or palate. nice ambience, friendly staff."
"I totally loved this place! It's very cozy there, and pricing is reasonable (especially when we went for the Tuesday Tappa special). Each dish was about $5-$7, and the portion wasn't super ��small as we had originally expected. I personally really liked the ribs and the risotto, and the hazelnut panna cotta was awesome for finishing a lovely meal. I am definitely planning to go back for the Monday family special sometime."
"I love this place, im not fond of the wait but it is a popular vegan hangout. the food is awsome I only wish there where more options for sandwiches. Like a vegan gordon blue or vegan parmesan chicken sandwich. maybe a vegan gumbo to for those cold night you want something hearty. but I love the food I have eaten when i was there. the seitan geyro and sweet potato fries hit the spot and there disserts are to die for."
"We went here for dinner, got here early at 5:30 on a Saturday and there were already larger parties having to wait, but my wife and I were able to get seated immediately. The food was fantastic. The dishes are small and you can order as you go. ��We started with ricotta/honey spread with bread that was incredible. We thought that the special for the evening, ox-tail dates and polenta was amazing. The ravioli was good, but it was one gigantic ravioli and did not blow us away like the other dishes. The cheese and meat tray was good, but we could have done with out it. I say stick to the specials and pick one of their amazing spreads with bread. The price was so incredible, the only thing that made our bill higher was the bottle of wine (with a cork fee)."
I went with a large group (13) while on vacation and we all absolutely LOVED our entrees. ��My boyfriend and my best friends boyfriend each got a different kind of steak and they were sharing with each other across the table because it was so good! ��I got Chicken Medeira which was scruptious! ��The menu is huge. ��I loved it.
"I went to XOCO yesterday and was seriously underwhelmed. We waited in line for about 30 minutes having arrived at about 7pm or so. They will not take your order until there is a table available for you, fair enough. We had chips and salsa, the milanesa, cubana, a lemonade and a bohemia beer, and a few churros, total came to $40. A little steep for a Corner Bakery type experience. We got seats at a little bar on high chairs and tucked into the chips and salsa. Ok, nothing special, can get the same at Jewel. The sandwiches were tasty, but not special, about the level of a Corner Bakery club panini :) The churros were super gross, greasy and hard, I totally have no clue why people are raving. It looks like they were under the heat lamp for a long time because the minute they were pulled out f"
"My boyfriend, daughter and I stumbled upon this place and we fell in love with it!!! The presentation of the food was incredible and the sushi was absolutely delicious. ��We were also pleased to see that the staff ��was ��""child friendly"" as they recommended a dish my daughter may like...not only did my daughter love it but she asked for another order.We will definitely be coming back for more!!"
"Number 1: This is an experience, more than ""going to get a bite."" Number 2: If you don't appreciate creativity in your food and are uncomfortable outside the normal spectrum of flavors and colors and textures, this isn't for you. Number 3: We had a spectacular meal. We went here for my husband's birthday, wanting to do something interesting and as he is a fan of the show the chef is on (which I don't watch) I thought he might enjoy it. We had the 10 course tasting menu, which was definitely the way to go (I think we could have done the larger one, but I'd written in with my reservation that we had a theatre reservation 2.5 hours after the start of the meal and the waiter said that based on that, we really didn't have time for it - very thoughtful service). Everything was fun, some I was le"
"Had the pleasure of dining at Wildfire last night with a party of four. We called and made reservations for 7:30 PM. When we arrived we were immediately seated even though they were very busy. Our server Mike Gavin was not only knowledgable about the menu and wine, but also provided us with some suggestions on house favorites. We were enjoying ourselves and can honestly say Mike rolled with the punches and never missed a beat. This was not our first time dining at Wildfire, so we knew to expect a delicious and well prepared meal. The Appetizers were delicious. The Prime Rib, Filet Mignon trio, and Brown sugar glazed Salmon were done perfectly. One of my friends who does not even eat fish tried the Salmon and commented that it was excellent. Desert was decadent and a chocoholics dream. I wo"
"fantastic burger. ��burger actually tastes good, not just decorations placed on top (kumas). ��you also don't have to wait 3 hours to get a wicked burger."
I liked it very much ! great food and service.
"The food is good. The service.. the waiters are very nice and they really try.. but the place is crowded so its very difficult to receive a good service. The food is good.. original.. unique.. a little expensive... and the music is TERRIBLE.. it doesn't have anything to do with he concept of the Restaurant.. at all.. is like heavy rock.. it's annoying. The hostess are not very nice and I think they should try to look a little better or at least wear something that help the client recognize them, they are wearing normal clothes.. .. but the bartenders are very nice.. highly recommend the squash.. the pork neck.. and the pistaccio ice cream."
"Based on other reviews I was expecting extremely slow service but we had great service at the lunch buffet-no wait at all at any point and friendly staff. I also felt it was reasonable at $15/pp since buffets include appetizers and dessert. A very large selection of vegetarian dishes, 3 desserts, tomato soup, etc. I was also expecting spectacular naan based on other reviews, but felt it was just as good as I've had elsewhere. Great atmosphere. Looking forward to going back."
"This is the best sushi for delivery. I have never been to the restaurant, but always get the sushi delivered to my house and business. ��They can also do hand rolls if requested..YUM! I find the sushi fresh and the rolls are fabulous. I tried the Honey roll recently and it was awesome..nice crunch and sweetness."
"I haven't had fondue at many places, but the few I have had it at have taught me that it's either done very right or very wrong! Geja's Cafe does it to perfection! We started with drinks at the bar while we waited for our table. I had a Strawberry Mojito that was one of the best mojitos I've ever had. Then we were seated in a nice booth, which is so much more private than a table. We started with the house salad, which was very good...loved the dressing, though it may have been a bit too much. That was followed by their signature cheese fondue that I couldn't stop eating, such a good blend of cheeses! We both had the Aged Beef Tenderloin which was delicious, especially dipped in the multiple sauces they bring to each table. I could barely find room to get in even a few bites of the chocola"
"I'm a local that gets to come in quite often. As much as possible whenever I get the craving for vietnamese!The owner is always so nice, he always gets us seated promptly, or when it's too busy he'll make sure we're comforted with some mini eggrolls to keep us munching until our table is ready. Once seated, the service is fantastic and the food is delicious as always. I tend to like the beef noodle soup as my appetizer and then move onto an entree like the sate shrimp, simply it's beef, or the pineapple callamari. Then comes desert, my friends and I love to order a round or two of the crispy fried bananas.it's also byob, a definite plus!"
"Good Atmosphere, music, sushi was packed full, less rice. Im addicted, been there 3 times since first trying them a week ago."
"We came here recently with a group of 8. Was my 1st time here and I honestly kept thinking about XOCO the entire time. Wishing I was there instead. Strange, right? Overall it was a fun night , good times, good drinks and food. But for the money, there's better value next door!"
"This place is definitely my style. My friend and I walked in here and immediately felt at home being of the goth persuasion as far as our high-school roots go. Even though the drinks were a little pricey for us, we came prepared and were completely satisfied with every single thing we ordered because of its perfection. I feel like this is the kind of place where you would meet some strange and interesting people with amazing life stories. I would feel comfortable sitting here reading or writing poetry - it's just an awesome and dark and mysterious little place. I highly recommend it!"
"We went visited this fabulous little restaurant on our spring break trip to Chicago with our exchange student from Romania. ��My husband and I couldn't tell you if the delicious food that we ate was authentic, but she said it tasted just like home. ��The owner was extra attentive when he discovered that we were hosting a student from Romania. ��It was so much fun and he even gave us a ride back to the hotel after a tour of the loop. ��He didn't want us to have to take the train back to the hotel. ��We would definitely return to Bucharest Little Bistro if we go to Chicago again!"
Read this post for my last (but not final!) Glenn's experience. Check out the Food Network on November 24th at 9:00PM for the night I write about.http://genopetroche.blog��_
"Sooo good.. coffee, fresh juices, nutella pancakes, and the scramblers are amazing.. only bad thing is the wait.. you can't make a reservation and if you go on a weekend the wait from 10-12 is likely to be around 45 minutes..."
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best Sausage and Hot Dogs in Town TRUELY my favorite The Tessio Sausage is my favorite Eaten here to many times I LOVE IT
"Hopleaf has great food and great beer. the real reason to go of course, is the beer. If you're hungry, the added bonus if the food is good. It's not as mind altering good as a lot of people say, but if you're in this bar that has such fantastic beer and the food is creative and really good, who can top that? At least for a bar this is my favorite place.I agree, the service is crappy and more or less indifferent. If you want great service, go to Big Jones or Jin Ju."
"OMG this place ROCKS. I am not a big beer drinker but this brew is making me think twice about beer. I had the Bacon, parm, and Basil Popcorn which was good and only 4.00 so I didnt feel like i was being taken. I had the Mussels with blue cheese, leeks, and apples. OMG it was the BEST. had to get more bread to suck up the juice but it was not enough....so, i ate it like soup. MMMMM. we also had the duck and bread appetizer and it was da bomb. I really recommend this place. It was great. The wait on Friday night was too long 2.5 hrs at 7:00 at night. So we went Sunday around 12:00 and its was very biz, but not too long of a wait. I cant wait to go back."
"Came here last night with the bf and must say that Davanti certainly lives up to all the positive reviews posted here. The wait for a Sunday night at 6:15 was only 15 minutes. ��We shared the pork belly pizza, the big ravioli, and the penne with sausage. ��All delicious. ��Can't say that you could go wrong with anything on the menu. ��The quartino is a pretty good deal for wine, giving you a glass and a half for 7-10 bucks. ��They also had Sophie on tap, which the bf liked. ��The best part of the evening - FREE DESSERT compliments of the owner. ��Can't wait to come back and try the Polenta special!"
"I can't stop raving about our diner at Graham Elliot. ��We have dined at many of the higher end restaurants in Chicago and can say that this is in the top four in terms of not only food, but service that makes you feel comfortable, if not at the top. ��We did find it odd at first that we were told that we wouldn't be seated until the actual reservation time (we got there about 20 min early) despite there being many open tables. ��We later discovered that it wasn't due to open tables, rather that there was a private dining event in a back room and they needed to make sure to stagger the tables so that the kitchen and wait staff would be able to attend to all tables with the same attention. ��Waiting until the reservation time so that we have attentive service is not a problem in my book.The foo"
"Great for brunch or lunch! I studied in Morocco as a college student and love anything that reminds me of those sweet/savory flavors. Icosium has a really great selection of North African and European flavors. Best of all, it's cheap and the service is great!"
"My girlfriend and I loved Mastro's. The server (Griffin Greenberg) that waited on our table was excellent, very knowledgeable with his wine and entrees. The entire management staff was very friendly and treated us like regular guests. I will be frequenting this restaurant. If you enjoy a great bottle of wine request that Griffin is your server when you make reservations. 5stars!!!!!"
Great place for visitors to eat while vacationing with toddlers in the city! Food choice was massive and I ended up getting a delicious Polynesian salad and my husband got the best mushroom burger ever. It came with a very tasty basil aioli sauce. Our toddler got some home made chicken fingers of which she actually ate!
WOW ..what an amazing place. I'm just upset that this is the first I've heard of it. I was walking around in my neighbor hood when i saw a long line to get in to this place. We peeked inside and grabbed a menu to go by the time we made it home we called in an order and walked back for it. ��Completely worth it. DELICIOUS.....my new favorite .
"Great food great service everything was absolutely delicious,the best part BYOB."
"I am definitely going back to Cafe28 for another outstanding meal. It was lively but not too loud, the service was pretty good and the food was fantastic! The price is not the budget level. It was worth every penny,though. Located right under the brown line stop, it's very easy to get to."
"Oh. ��My. ��God. ��This is good.I started going here when it first opened, and I've gotta say it's gotten a LOT more crowded since then, which is kind of a bummer but I completely understand why. ��The expansion of the porch that they made makes a difference, too.The ox-tail is fantastic, and I'm always a sucker for sweet plantains. ��Seriously, I could eat those things for every meal. ��The sandwiches and cafe con leche are also good if you're in the mood for something a little lighter.PLUS if you bring a bottle of wine, they have a sangria mix. ��Oh yeah.To be honest, I don't know what that previous reviewer was complaining about with the service. ��Every time I've gone there the wait staff has been really attentive. ��They're always patient with me when I make bad attempts to pronounce menu item"
"Superdawg has one of the best hot dogs in Chicago. ��The fries are so great, too. ��I grew up on this place, and still make frequent trips from the burbs to eat there."
"It's a fast pace place where the quality is nowhere close to what I expected. I tried a few dishes like the clams with merguez, too oily and lacks the rustic part to a lamb sausage with mild cinnamon flavor. the scallops were not caramelized enough and the chickpeas were overcooked. The poached squid was average and needed salt, the pork chop a little tougher and dryer than expected. Wine list offers a bunch of wines by the glass. Overall, efficient service but nothing exceptional in terms of flavors"
"This place is great. ��I like all the different types of food you can try and the salad bar is endless, the options and the size. ��The only knock is that there is soooo much food that you are stuffed before you can even try it all :)"
"Worst bartender service ever. Go out of business and do all of us a favor. The one four-eyed bartender is a real piece of work. I look forward to seeing him working at McDonald's flipping hamburgers. What has this world come to where complete rude jerks without any educations are serving us alcohol and allowed to give us attitude. Al Capone would roll over in his grave. I can't wait to see the day when Green Mill is going out of business. It will be coming soon. The musicians will easily find a new gig to play at, where they actually aren't rude to their customers."
"It was between the Mayan Palace and Tango Sur, I have never been to Tango Sur, but having picked the Mayan Palace did not leave me wishing I had picked otherwise. ��I usually frequent El Mariachi on the corner of Broadway and Sheridan, and the Mayan Palace was on par, if not better. ��The place is a bit cozy but even on a Friday night, it was not a bad wait to get a table.Upon being seated, they started us with the standard chips and salsa. ��We ordered a couple margaritas, one banana and one pineapple, to try something different, we then moved to a pitcher of regular blended margaritas. ��All were great!For food we started with guacamole, although it was good, the limited space in the joint must prevent them from preparing the guacamole tableside. ��Entrees I can recall being ordered were the "
"Really enjoyed dinner. ��A bit pricey and more of a ""scene"" than food-centric. ��Would go back. ��Tough to get prime reservation times."
"It's one of my favorite places in the city- I love the cheese and the wine and they have really cool events like a Movie and Dinner night and Wine Classes. ��I have learned more about wine from the staff at BIN 36 (and bin wine cafe) than at any of the other wine bars in the city that I have visited, they make it fun and easy and are always willing to share a taste of ��a wine that I'm interested in but don't want to commit to. ��I must say I usually sit in the casual dining area or at the bar and have never had dinner in the dining room. ��But, the food is always good and the wine is terrific! �� Check out the dinner and a movie, I'm a regular at that one and its always a great time. �� ��If you haven't been here you should try it- it's on my top ten places and I'm picky."
"Went to eat after watching the Blue Man Group show a couple blocks away. ��The service was great as we sat outside in their patio area. ��However, their menu was limited at 9pm but the food was good."
"All the food here is fresh and delicious, but a little gem on the menu is The Amazing Turkey Burger. ��I am particularly fond of them. ��I ��have sampled Turkey Burgers all over The Chicago land area. ��I've gone from fancy hotels to bars and it just doesn't compare to The 3 Coast Cafes version. ��This is my secret indulgence I wait for once a week.I get it with grilled mushrooms and a slice of Swiss. ��They give you all the fixings on the side (which I like) lettuce tomato etc... ��Every bite is Hot, Juicy, Moist and Delicious. ��Not easy to do with Turkey. ��The mix of flavors just melt in your mouth with every bite. ��Amazing !"
"SHADY!!! (even if you're into goulash) ?Beware of schill reviews from employees.WOULD NOT HONOR RESTAURANT.COM GIFT CERTIFICATE-Told us to order more food, desserts, etc. to bring our bill above arbitrarily changing minimum purchase amounts (clearly more than what was printed on our certificate)Right off the bat, the hostess asked if we were Romanian. ?Since we were the only non-Romanians in the place (actually there were only two families present on a Thursday night at 7:30) they gave us weird menus with inflated prices. ?Weird because they were crinkly pieces of paper with pen underlining and spilled food on them.The GYPSY decor didn't quite reconcile the $17-25 entree prices. ?We didn't actually try any of the food (mainly variations of stew or goulash) because the server was completely"
"The most amazing sushi in town! So lucky to live only 5 min away from this place and it is our must-go spot for all kinds of occasions- out-of-town guests, date night, girls' night out. Love, love, love it! Try the SushiFruit on the specialty rolls, or the Shrimp Tempura megaroll! Amazing!"
Nice find in the neighborhood. Fresh pasta with some fun choices. Try the wild boar ragu with a quartino of one of their exceptionally well-chosen Italian varietals. They offer smaller portions of most pastas which is a nice option when you're just popping in from a walk around Andersonville for a quick bite.
A little pricey but always delicious. ��If I lived closer my budget would be blown by all the wonderful treats inside this store. ��I often grab some food here before hitting the park for a nice picnic! ��Amazing cheese selection that just makes my mouth water if I could handle all that dairy. ��F&O always makes me smile. ��:D
"Ok, I've only been to the soft-opening, so I don't know the prices yet, but I was compelled to write this anyway. In sum total, it was THE best restaurant opening I've ever had the pleasure to be invited to. Aside from the fact that it was free (!), guests were provided with THE best lobster, crab legs, crab claws, ahi tuna, and steak I've ever had in my life!....and that's ASIDE from the fact that it was free. Oh yeah...superb wine, desserts (warm butter cake!), service, and overall ambiance as well. Did I mention that the soft opening was all you can eat? Yowzer!! I cannot wait to try this place again, with REAL money on the line. If it's even 75% as good as it was last night, it will easily surpass my expectations. Simply put, I think it may turn out to be the best that Chicago has to o"
Great bibimbop.
Food bad. (VERY)Drinks okayVibe seems forcedService good.
The ultimate place to go for deep dish pizza. The best pizza I have ever eaten.
"Every time we am in town with guests, we love going upstairs and having �� drinks and appetizers. �� It's wonderful ! �� ��It's like being in another world....a beautiful, relaxing place that's away from the busy, hectic big-city pace. �� It's cheaper than a flight to a remote island. �� My wife and I love it here ! �� Our favorite appetizer is the shrimp on sugar cane sticks."
"Probably some of the best thin crust pizza I've ever had - haven't dined in, just had pizza and salad delivered, but I'm definitely a fan. My favorite is the vegetarian thin crust; my husband likes the Calo special pizza. Greek salad is also quite good. Delicious and they deliver fairly late in the evening. You can't go wrong."
"THIS MAY VERY WELL BE THE BEST VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!!!!!!! It is a MUST for anyone traveling through the area vegetarian or not! The vegan Country fried steak was AMAZING as well as the mac and cheese! Please, do yourself a favor and visit this restaurant at some point in your life!"
Great food and usually great staff. �� One of my favorites when in ORD.....
"First, ��I should say that I hate deep dish. �� This thin-crust Neapolitan style pizza is like a spiritual experience for me. ��Best in the world. ��Try the arugula pizza. ��I would never think to put it on a pizza, but it combines with their ultra-fresh buffalo mozzarella for a nutty, creamy, perfected flavor. ��I would eat it every day if I could.Also get the bianco nero if it's on the specials list when you're there. ��This is a white pizza, with truffle-infused pecorino cheese and porcini mushrooms. ��I can't talk with my table mates when I order it, because it's like I need to be alone with the bianco nero. ��It gets into my soul.Their crust is exquisite. ��Slightly crispy on the outside, but chewy inside. ��It's so thin you could read through it.The tomato sauce is simple, and brings out the fl"
"Cozy place to have a good drink and dinner. Their portions are fairly generous and I've always had friendly service. i hear Sunday Brunch is good, so I'm looking forward to it."
dam good..dam cheap...check it out
wow. ��we were in chicago for a week and once we found yolk we ate there every day. ��Really really good.
This place is pretty fantastic. I've never eaten at a Romanian restaurant so I was apprehensive but they shocked me. The owner is incredibly cool and the food was great and well worth the wait.
"My husband and I always pass by this restaurant in our area and it always smells so good outside of it so we decided to go on a date and go there for our first time...90 miles Cuban has phenomenal food! The waitress are great, ��the feel of the restaurant is welcoming, great location, you don't have to wait for long to be seated, there food portions are big and they even have BYOB. I love this place I truly do recommend everyone to try it....My hubby & I had Ropa Vieja (Shredded beef) with white rice, black beans & sweet plantains and it was Delicious! ...Don't take my word for it try it. =)"
Best Hot Dog I have ever had = Alligator Hot Dog!!
"The Art of Pizza has some plaque on their wall declaring them a winner of a Zagat award at some point in recent history. ��They probably deserved it. ��Of all the ""slices to go"" places I have been, The Art of Pizza is the hands down winner.The slices are never stale or old. ��One time, being gluttonous, I asked for a specific slice (by far, the largest I could see). ��They weren't too busy, so the gentleman behind the counter took the time to tell me that it was actually older than those on the rack above, and would I care for a fresher slice? ��Yes, yes I would...thank you Art of Pizza!They have side salads pre-made and ready to go for people like myself who want to pretend we're being somewhat healthy. ��I know iceberg lettuce does nothing for you, but it makes me feel better. ��They also have "
Cozy place with an old world feel. the drinks were inventive and sooo yummy! Dinner was pricey but delicious! I highly recommend the Scallops and Foie gras small plates and the duck for entree. Save room for dessert because the mini donuts were great with a touch of ginger. Yum! I can't wait to return..
"Horrible service and would recommend avoidingWas charged $60 for a lunch for two peopleOwner promised a gift certificate for the issue and never followed upTry Aperitif 21, Shiraz, Pars Cove or even Reza's instead"
"Great place for vegetarians, less so for omnivores. Our service was fine, but we went in expecting everything to be very slow. The back room seems to be a better spot for a romantic date."
"The BBQ, service and atmosphere at Chicago q is out of this world! My group ordered the bacon cheddar hush puppy appetizer which blew our minds with the slightly spicy and fluffy flavor. The picture on their website of these delicious puppies is enough to make you drool. You are also served a delicious pickel appetizer as well as some southern spiced chips. I ordered the kobe sliced brisket with a side of poblano cheddar corn bread and I couldn't have been more delighted with my choice. The beef was smoked to perfection and the array of sauces brought to table made for a fun mix-and-match of tastes. My entire group was highly pleased with our selections of food and drink.What truly made Chicago q stand out was the attentive, knowledgeable and passionate wait staff on a crowed Saturday nigh"
The food is fabulous! The decor is stunning. We loving dinning at Zed451. This is one of our most favorite spots to have dinner and then drinks upstairs on the outdoor deck. Great place to hang out with friends.
A +++
"The spring rolls and veggie noodle soup (as close to pho as a vegan could want) are amazing. ��You get a generous portion for the price and the food warms body and soul - perfect for chilly Chicago nights!The place is always packed, but the staff is friendly and keeps things moving well."
"Macaroons. Perfect, tasty, bursting with flavor macaroons.That's all the info you need."
"After a good friend of mine said You gotta try the burger! I had to give it a shot...And I will say, the food was Okay. Not the best, and not the worst either. If the menu was 1/2 the price I would say Hey! You gotta check it out - but after being gouged on the prices, having just okay (at best) dining and dealing with hipster snobbishness..Um...By all means, PASS on this! I'd rather go to Bluebird and have a charcuterie plate and beer with a shot over and be in the presence of Real people who are happy you stopped into their establishment. I heard the owner owns the Empty Bottle and Beauty Bar...Yup, those places suck too."
"Place is off the hook! Right when we walked into the place I asked the owner what ""green line"" beer was and he told me it was a beer made by coors. So he went on and gave me and my friends a free round. Plus food and service are amazing! Please check this place out!"
"Awesome colombian restaurant, great food and service. ��cant wait to see the new resturant space."
I love Cubans! This place is pretty good. The coconut shrimp was a hit and so was the salmon and the steaks and the pork. And you can't go wrong with alcohol. No one really had a bad meal and I would recommend going again. If you want to hang out all night I would recommend going after 7pm. If you are starving and want a meal served fast go before 7pm.
The salad bar's very cool. ��But I like the drink specials and the vibe. ��I love the burgers here. Good music and it's across from the zoo. ��No parking though.
"Crisp, when translated from Koren, means yay. ��At least, that's how I feel after each time I have a meal here. �� I was so excited when I discovered Crisp since Koreans are known in Asia for their fried chicken but it's not common knowledge in this country yet. ��I have my brother to thank for introducing me. ��I started going to Crisp when it first opened and the owner was still working the counter. He truly listens to his customers because I asked him why he wasn't carrying Milkies (which happens to be one of my favourite Korean beverages). ��Soon after, it appeared in their beverage coolers. ��The others who have since joined the Crisp team are stellar and I've enjoyed getting to know them as well.I have taken a tour around their menu and I cannot get past the Seoul Sassy wings and the Buddh"
I just love this restaurant! We have been going here for family celebratory dinners for about a yea now. This past Sunday we decided to try their brunch and it was fantastic! I can't wait to go back!
"best pizza EVER!!! order it to go !but it has to be :white pizza with plain crust brushed with olive oil, diced garlic, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and fresh tomatoes !!!da beers are weird and almost terrible :)"
"Delicious, delicious crepes. I've had the Paris and Marrakech. Both were wonderful. I'll be giving the more dessert-y crepes a try next time. So good."
"I have been here two times now, and I have nothing but good things to say about this place. The food, the drinks, the atmosphere, and service have been stellar. My only complaint is that I wish the tartare and bone marrow weren't so good so I could try something else on the menu.I definitely would suggest this to any friend looking to lounge or go on a date. ��Client meetings might be a bit awkward, though, due to the more intimate atmosphere."
"My husband is a strict vegetarian, and while the veggie menu is small, it's still delicious (be sure to ask for veggie broth in your Pho, otherwise you might get chicken broth). I love the huge portions, authentic and unusual veggies and low prices! Service is terse but efficient. Love the BYOB!"
"So gf wante to come here because of the famous Rick Bayless, or whoever he is. We didn't even see the guy. Food was overpriced but very tastful. We tried some seafood soup. It was a bit spicy but very fulfiling. It was cool to look at the churro machine. Churro and choloate was good but small portion. I gave this restaurant 3 stars because it was too expensive for me."
"My brother recently came to Chicago from Houston for a quick visit. We were both craving Vietnamese food on a Sunday night. I've been here once or twice before with a couple friends and remembered it being delicious, so I wanted to introduce him to this place as well!When we got here, the owner was very hospitable and offered to seat us himself by the windows. The atmosphere is calm and warm, which helped us since it was pretty cold on Sunday night!Our waitress was really helpful in selecting dishes that would satisfy our cravings at the time. We ended up ordering the summer rolls and avocado wontons for appetizers. The summer rolls, albeit their name, were perfect. Very crisp and refreshing with the perfect accompanying sauce. The avocado wontons were a bit heavier, but were definitely a "
The food here is great and they give you a lot so expect left overs or head over with a really empty stomach to fill. This place is always packed so expect a wait and it can get pretty loud so conversation can be hard some times.
"Beyond disappointing. When I think of southern comfort food, I think of relaxing, fun environment. It started with a surly, indifferent waiter and went downhill from there. They were out of the special by 7:45 on a Tuesday night. Waited at least 10 minutes for the first drink. 30 minutes between appetizer and entree. And when the main course did arrive -- the highly recommended chicken-fried steak -- the meat and accompanying mushrooms were ice cold.To top it off, the bathroom was flooded and no attempt had been made to clean up/clear up an over-flowing urinal. Disgusting."
"Had the all-you-can-eat hot pot on Friday. They charged us 2 bucks extra per person because it was Friday. Food wasnt bad, but also not worth 20 bucks a person. Decent selection but I wanted more seafood and worthwhile food."
"Food is incredible! The menu is very limited, but is because the 4 or 5 items on the menu is their special. Everything is made fresh. ��The food tastes authentic, reasonably priced, and has a great ambiance. ��Highly recommend this gem of a place!"
"The food is amazing but the people who work here are downright nasty (especially the older woman who is always there). She is so rude that I tell people not to go here- for example, when I called in to place and order and tell them the website was down she gave me so much attitude and told me I was lying!?!. The next time I went in to pick up my food and asked a question about one of their ingrediants and she was nasty about answering me. Most of my friends have had similar experiences!"
"Super charming, authentic Italian spot. The atmosphere is very welcoming. Great ambience for a imprompty date night. Delicious pastas! Great place! Highly recommend."
My husband & I just returned from Vietnam & we were looking for a restaurant that was just as good as when there. The food at Simply It was amazing. The waitress was very nice and the greeter was so friendly. Prices were totally reasonable $11 for a dinner meal. Yum food! Casual atmosphere. Highly recommended!!!
"Amazing resturant. You need the brazilian meat expirence, it is one of a kind!"
great delicious food & service! & its very beautiful inside :)make sure to dress nice & casual
"This restaurant is AWESOME. The prices are reasonable, the staff is very friendly and I've never had bad service here. Get the emerald roll! Best item on the menu!"
All I have to say is F-ing go there. ��It's awesome in every way. ��Even moreso that I'm 4 blocks away. ��Mmmm...Revolution...
"Always crowded and loud on the weekends, but if you're patient enough, look forward to tasty coffee and ��whole multi-grain pancakes. ��Actually some of the best I've had. Nice variety of fresh fruit (pineapple, strawberries, melon) and veggie selection.The skillet had good potatoes, not as oily or fried as most, however I prefer veggie volume. ��No silly charge for egg whites. Vegetarian options and lots of variety on the menu. I'd like to go back and try some of the sea food options . Lunch menu is also enticing."
"I stumbled across this cafe last weekend, and what a score! ��I had a sandwich called, ""The Lechone"". ��It had juicy roasted pork, caramelized ��onions and delicious fried sweet plantains, all in the sandwich. ��Yummy! ��My friend had the ""Cuba-no"", which he also enjoyed. ��The only draw back was that the cafe didn't have tables. ��It had stools and counters. ��It's great for lunch. ��I also love the name!"
"My wife and I loved the food here! ��We each got a bottle of Hitachino Nest White Ale, which is a witbier from Japan -- very refreshing. ��To start, we ordered a half dozen raw oysters (I think we could have done a full dozen). ��They were extremely fresh and the waiter will explain what the different types will taste like, so you can order the ones that sound most appealing to you.The waiter told us that Shaw's was most known for the Alaskan King Crab legs, so I got the The Signature, which is a 6oz Filet Mignon and Alaskan King Crabs legs, and my wife got the Seasonal Crab Combination which came with Alaskan King Crab, Dungeness, and a Crab Cake.WOW! ��The Alaskan King Crabs were delicious! ��There was a ton of meat and it was extremely sweet. ��I wasn't expecting much from my Filet, but I was"
damn good pizza.
"Outstanding. We made an earlier reservation and got to sit on the terrace which was perfect. The food selection, preparation and presentation as well as the service was fantastic. Afterwords we headed up to the bar on the roof and had a few more cocktails. If you've not yet been to Le Colonial you need to go."
"OMG....this was the best pizza I have EVER eaten! I am NOT a fan of deep dish so we ordered the thin crust with hamburger, spinich, and mushrooms. ��Although it was pricey it was well worth it......and to top it off the service was great! ��Since returning to Texas, I have not been able to make myself go out for pizza. ��I have had good pizza but it just doesn't measure up to GIno's East! ��I definitly recommend the thin crust over the deep dish. ��It looks like they only ship the deep dish across the country but if they shipped the thin crust I would jump on the opportunity!"
"I'm surprised this doesn't have five stars! It's the best pan pizza in the city! More dough, less sauce than most others, but that's why I like it. The carmelized crust makes it the most unique in the city. Start with the jalapeno poppers. Finish with pan pepperoni. And you'll go home a VERY happy person!"
"My friends and I sat at a 4 top across the bar and waited 20 minutes to get our first round of drinks. In that time two deuces between us and the bar were sat. Those tables are waited on by the bartenders. They both got their drinks w/in a couple of minutes after ordering. In fact, one of them even got food before we got our drinks. Our server told us that those were bar tables and that the bartenders were not going to make their customers wait, even though we had ordered way ahead of them. Well that's just NOT cool! Orders should be attended to as they come in and not put on the back burner to help increase bar tips. Shame on them!! Although the food was all really good, this put such a damper on my evening that I'm thinking about not returning. If I do return, I will be sure to sit in on"
This place has amazing food. The prices are ok. The malts are better. Great atmosphere... a true chicago landmark. Don't miss it!
"I'm obviously not cool enough to drink here. ��Or maybe I just don't like paying over 20 dollars for two watered down gin and tonics. ��If you like the company of suburbanite snobs who drove really far to look the part, then this is your place. ��Or, you could join me for a drink with the rest of reality."
I have been to almost every Mexican restaurant in Chicago(Funny since I live here) and all I could say is Wow. This is authentic as it gets....take it from me I am a Mexi-can. enough said. I def recommend the Tampiquena if you are a meat eater....and the Shrimp Fajitas if you like sea food... the Chicken soup does not get more authentic and the flautas are plain delicious....but my favorite has to be their home made flour tortillas...and I hate flour tortillas otherwise.....
"I order takeout from Simply It at least once a week. ��The food is consistent and fresh. ��My favorite dishes include Pho and the shrimp spring roles. ��I've also tried many other menu options and am always pleased with my meal. ��The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience, and no one can beat 30 minute delivery. ��I've been to the restaurant a few times and find the experience just as warm and inviting. ��Simply It is simply the best Vietnamese food in LIncoln Park."
"Just tried Chicago q for the first time last night.I would definitely come here again. Standouts include the bbq chips and sweet pickles that others have mentioned. Delicious. The bourbon flight was also an outstanding deal if you're a bourbon fan.My wife got the pulled pork shoulder which was outstanding. I got the Kobe beef ribs which were just so-so. Although they had great flavor, they were not falling off the bone as advertised. Pretty tough actually, but still quite tasty.I have to say I was underwhelmed by all four sauces. My favorite was probably the mustard-based sauce, which is a tough one to find at most BBQ joints, so if you're a fan of that type of sauce, Chicago q may be your mustard mecca.My only other point of contention is that when I asked them to package up my leftovers,"
"I came here on a Monday night with a friend who is from Tulsa, Oklahoma. She thought it was great...I thought otherwise. It was a nice place, decorated very well, nice atmosphere, busy crowd (for a Monday), but the food was so-so. It didn't blow me away and there was a lot of confusion with the wait staff and bus boys. We were trying to decide between the special and one of the regular entrees, so we consulted with the waiter. Well he brought us both instead of what we decided on and hence, we felt obligated to just eat it and pay for it. Problem was, it wasnt very good. Lesson learned. Then the bussers kept trying to take away our food when we weren't done eating! We had to practically, yell, ""no, no!, were not done yet!"" when they were walking away with our unfinished plates!Overall, dec"
"This place was lovely-- I only went there once with my whiskey loving cousin (we spent an hour sipping whiskey and talking about the flavors) but I would love to go back and try something a bit more adventurous. The interior is beautiful (and violet of course) the seats are set up in a very secluded way, and our waitress was very attentive. I love that there's no sign outside, and that the door is somewhat hidden-- it makes you feel like you've discovered something rare and almost like you're walking into another world. I can't wait to go back!"
"This is my FAVORITE place for pizza. ��Hands down, the most delicious pizza you will find in Chicago. ��I'm a big fan of the salsiccia - Italian sausage, mozzarella, basil. If you have had true Italian pizza (as in, the pizza you would find in Italy), then you know that Spacca is the only place that can re-create that authentic experience. ��Brava!"
This is a must visit for any wine aficionado. ��The wine flights are the best and very educational. I have a gazillion of the little cards that I take with me on every visit. I kick myself when I forget them at home. The food is excellent for appetizers. Be aware that it is all very pricey. I suggest this is the place to start or finish and to sit at the bars.
"First off, its no map room. ��The service can be fantastically pretentious, unfriendly, and at time down-right rude. ��Fortunately, this tends to happen more when its crowded than when its not. ��Now I'll go in only during the day or very early afternoon. ��The beer list is killer and the pomme frites are delicious but prices are needlessly high. ��We'll maybe not needlessly, but enough so that they wrote a defense of their pricing in last months beer advocate saying that it cost them something ridiculous like 3k to open their doors every morning. ��It definitely worth checking out or hanging out with friends at two in the afternoon but do yourself a favor and try the map room down in bucktown as a comparison."
"Dinner was great, service was okay. ��My ribeye was cooked perfectly and I will definitely come back."
"How can you dine at a restaurant with an open mind after it has canceled the day of your reservation THREE consecutive times? ��I can't and will not. ��My friends and I have had a table for four at Schwa three different times all to be canceled on the day-of. ��The first two cancelations were both within two hours of the reservation and the third cancelation was four hours before we were due there. ��Thank goodness I wasn't entertaining business associates or guests from out of town. ��This behavior is unacceptable, disrespectful, and untolerable. �� Instead of taking our wallets to Schwa we will continue exploring Chicago's culinary scene elsewhere."
"We had a nice dinner here a few weeks ago. ��We went on a Tuesday, so it wasn't too busy, and were able to sit right away. ��There were a lot of selections on the menu but my favorite was the cornbread, quite delicious! �� I didn't get to see the whole space but the front area was fine. ��the only issue we had is that they did bring courses out really quickly so we felt rushed and didn't have room on our table, but the waitrss apologized and she was really attentive and friendly."
"Great restaurant, great staff and most importantly great food. The best grilled octopus in the world....love it."
Best meal I've ever had. ��The tasting menu with pairings was divine! ��Perfect place for that extra special occasion :)
"Shaw's has consistently been one of the finest seafood restaurants in Chicago. ��The food is excellent and I would always receommend the Oysters, softshell crab (when in season) and the clam chowder. ��The service has always been consistent. ��I would receommend this to anyone looking for a great seafood experience in the midwest."
"This is a hole in the wall place with cheap food and many mustachioed, skinny jean clad customers. Service is hit or miss, but almost always without a smile.They make a good falafel sandwich, almost every time. Not the best falafel in the world, but not bad at all. Definitely get hot sauce on your pita falafel sandwich. Yum. I wouldn't eat meat there again, after trying it once.Cash-only."
"Restaurant charged a $2.50 per person fee to cut a cake we brought for a birthday. On the phone we were told it was just $1.50, which is still ridiculous, but oh, well. Then we got slammed with the $2.50 ending up to be about $30 total. That's just TOO WRONG. ��Needless to say, it is place I would not miss by not going."
"We were a bit hesitant at first to book a reservation as the reviews seemed so flip-floppy, but we did anyways and boy were we impressed. I'm happy to say that while dining at GE while on a trip to Chicago, I experienced something so wonderful, incredible, and possibly life changing, that I'm quite sure it will remain unmatched.After taking a seat at the bar, because we arrived early, we proceeded to order a bottle of wine for myself and two girlfriends. Unfortunately the wine was not chilled so we were presented with glasses of champagne whilst the bottle was readied. Our bartender was fantastic, lively and set a great mood for the rest of the night by playing certain songs just for us.Once we were seated, Jeff did everything in his power to make our meal memorable. From working with the "
After reading several reviews I was very surprised no one mentioned Miriam - the proud owner and back bone of Irazu. I was lucky enough to discover Irazu when Armitage and Western was still a mostly dilapidated heroin zone and I have always enjoyed Irazu. Very good food served with a smile!
"I'm not sure I get this place. I eat here every time we go to see our lawyers or accountants at the office, which is pretty often, because it seems like ""Michigan Avenue""-grade eating for better than Michigan Ave prices.The offering is very Michigan Avenue and so is the look of the restaurant and clientele (and the service is pretty good) which is refreshing if you're like me and generally spend most of your time (by choice) in dives and student clubs. The food, though, is pretty mediocre. It's not bad, but it's not great, and because that's the focus of the whole experience, it hurts the rating. My advice: the simpler and more common the food you order, the better it'll be.I guess the moral of the story is that you get what you pay for, contextual to where you pay for it. Not bad, not gre"
"Sad to see / taste that Garcia's has gone way down in quality. It used to be a great late night spot with consistently good food; now I don't want to go back. The food is bland, unseasoned and greasy. My past few visits have been my last to Garcia's. Any suggestions for a replacement?"
"6 of us went for lunch...(on the referall of Tom, My nail tech.) We drove 90 miles to go there and Trader Joes. Was worth the trip!!. Based on reviews we ordered spring rolls,a congee dish, a pho dish, and then an assortment of seafood and chicken main courses.. The only item we did not like was the congee dish. kinda like a chicken broth and rice soup,but rice was mushy...perhaps that is how it is supposed to be , but we did not care for it....BYOB was allowed and we enjoyed wine w/our dinner....Be sure a ask for Jome to wait on you, because his service was excellent from start to finish!He opened our wine,brought glasses and after dinner brought to go containers for all of our leftovers!"
This is the best and most authentic chinese restaurant in chicago and maybe the best in the midwest. ��I've had sze chuan food from hundreds of different places all over the country and this food is phenomenal. ��I recomend the lunch special and anything with a pepper next to it. ��The dishes I had most recently were **TONY'S SPECIAL CHICKEN W/THREE CHILI** and **LAMB W/PURE CUMIN POWDER XING JANG STYLE** ��(They are all good though.) Don't be a typical american and order orange chicken (but even if you do it will be fantastic.) I try to eat at this place at LEAST once a month and this month I've already been twice.
I have been going here since about 2002 as it is one of my favorite cozy spots in Chicago. The steaks and pastas are usually perfect and the staff is very courteous. Its a great date place because you can actually hear people at your table. I love the atmosphere and the food is moderately priced. I love this place!
"What a great spot for a Friday night! ��This place is so hip, but also very loud. If you are looking for an intimate conversation, don't go. If you want some great food and great people watching, this is the spot. We had a great waitress, and all the food was exceptional. We loved the free starter crab salad that was delivered as soon as we sat down. We then proceeded to order all small plates - a couple at a time. The menu was extensive so we asked our waitress for advice. She told us all her favorites, and none of them were disappointing! ��We have found in Asian restaurants that appetizers are always more flavorful than entrees, so we just kept on ordering until our tummies said, STOP! ��We will definitely go back the next time we are in Chicago."
"This is one of the nicer family owned restaurants in Lincoln Park. I've been hitting up and down the street with lots of great food but this is the one place that just stuck to me!It's a very nice cozy small place that is run by a very nice man out front. We came in a saturday night that was busy booked with reservations. While we waited for our table we were given mini eggrolls to eat. It was sooo delicious. We were finally seated and I must say it was absolutely worth every minute of that wait. The appetizersof shrimp tempura and avocado wontons were scrumptious. My main course of the Simply It's beef was absolutely the most tender fillet mignon I've ever tried.To top it off, little rice cookies and oranges were given to me at the end of my meal. It doesn't get any better than this in Li"
"Not that this place needs another review, but it made me join Yelp just to do it.I took my wife here on a Sunday night, usually places are slow so you get a little better attention, but this place was hoping like a friday all nighter party. ?We had to wait a few minutes at the bar after getting our car valet parked (only $5) and checking our coats (for free). ?The bar totally fooled me because it was kind of dark and quiet, with a few people hanging and one very busy bartender. ?Soon after we got our drinks our buzzer went off for the table.Our hostess walked us from the cave of the bar into the colorful lit party dining room. ?We walked in and it was so bright and colorful, but somehow not over the top. ?The waiter was really friendly and gave us explainations of things on the menu withou"
"My worst take out experience ever....1. it took an hour and a half to get to the apartment (after I called twice, and was told it was on the way both times) and it initially was promised to be there in 45-60 minutes2. Obviously the food (crab rangoon) was freezing cold, I have never received food this cold in my entire life...3. The delivery person didn't come to the door to deliver the food but called us from her car instead4. There were two hairs on the edamameTo say the least, we ended up throwing away our food and I ended my night in tears. It was honestly the worst experience I've ever had with a restaurant"
The decor of this restaurant is exceptional! I personally like their calamari! It's the best! They also have a wide selection of desserts! I will always keep on coming back when I go downtown to shop.
"My daughter adores Sabatino's and this is the only place she eats all her food. We both love the musicians and staff. Cocktails are great, Wednesday night is lobster night-amazing to say the least. You'll not leave hungry for sure!!! They also have upstairs room great for any occasions."
"This place is AMAZING! ��Best pizza in Chicago! ��By far. ��We've been struggling to find good NY style pizza, but this is it. ��It's the best!"
I liked the services offered by (Alinea) restaurant and will definitely come again and again whenever i get a chance or ceremony to come in.
"I was there on the FRIST day it opened and have been coming back ever sense!!!! Incredable quality, consistent time and time again!!! The mark of a true master of any cuisine!!"
"This is a great place to take your non-vegan/veggie friends to get them to try some alternative foods.Some of the prices are a bit high and the quality of food can be a little inconsistent, but the staff is generally friendly and there are a lot of options.The mac and cheeze is a favourite, as is pretty much anything from the dessert menu."
"We like going there for their food bar, which is amazing... Staff ��is well trained food is very delicious the moving around at a fast pace is a bit disturbing...Will go back."
Mark on Lake Shore DriveI was disappointed with the delivery that we had on Tuesday 10/25/11. When the food arrived it was cold my sandwich was very soggy and tasted bad. Our order was short one diet coke and we were charged for it. When we called Crisp they acted like it was our fault and we were talked down to. I don't recommend this place at all.
"If you live in Chicago, If you Work in Chicago, If you visit Chicago the only Hotdog is a Superdawg! Sure everyone clams their dogs are best BUT don't be fooled! I've lived in Chicago for 30+ years and tried everyone's best hot dog However I have found that a Superdawg is truly the BEST!! Big fat juicy pure beef (much bigger than other dawgs), steamed S. Rosen's poppy seed buns, mustard, onions, florescent green relish, pickled tomato, Kosher pickle, sport peppers, celery salt! ?I would bet that no other place has better fries as well! There is no other dawg like it! Sick of dawgs? for a special treat try their grilled cheese on dark rye gooey yummy goodness Awesome!"
"We went here for brunch - so was the place was kinda quiet and we had the total attention of the host. The food is good but I wouldn't call it amazing. The marrow dish was soupy and the ears weren't amazing. They had a good wine selection. Overall, it was decent but verrry pricey."
"Wow! The service was ghastly. ��The hostess was beyond rude and was dismissive. ��This was especially appalling since our visit occurred during an off-peak hour. ��The server seemed annoyed with our table, but we had not exhibited any behavior to warrant such a response. ��Many other places in the city offer extensive wine lists and flights and would be an infinitely better choice than this establishment."
"We just visited here on our vacation and are sooo glad we did! The service was awesome! When you visit for the first time it's a bit confusing because you have to go up to the counter and order and then a hostess takes you to your table, but the hostess was great and let us know how everything worked as soon as we got in.My boyfriend and I shared the Chipotle Chicken Torta, an order of guac and chips and churros with warm chocolate dipping sauce! Everything was delicious! I did get one little piece of cartilage in my chicken though, hence the loss of one star, but everything else was great."
"The thin pie is quite good. ��Black beans and rice are fantastic. �� But the half chicken special is outstanding. Staff is friendly too. �� Really everything here is good and the price is fair. ��I love this place and recommend anyone trying it out. ��If so, youll be back."
"I LOVE this place...mostly have it delivered to work when I'm treating my employees for lunch, but when I want a great dinner I will have it delivered or dine there. The owner is a wonderful man(Tuan) who shows his appreciations and treats you like royalty. Sometimes, I have been disappointed by the young lady or gent when they've answered the phone and seemed too busy to take my order, but I love the food and the owner too much to let that stop me from being a loyal customer!"
"I've been going to this restaurant basically once a week. Food is excellent every time. Service A+The interior of the restaurant makes you feel very comfy and the library.. were friends and I often sit, have drinks & eat is awsome!I would suggest anyone visiting Chicago/Lake View or even close by to take the drive beacause it is worthwhile!And by the way... if you don't know about Oscar Wilde doa WiKi search... interesting story & character. Thumbs up!"

Went there before we moved to Raleigh. Good food and service
"After reading several of the past reviews, I feel like I agree with all the reviews. My wife and I put our reservation in over 6 months before we got a table, but it was worth the wait. I will never go back, because I don't think any meal can justify the $150 per person price tag (just the cost of the tasting menu), but if you really want to splurge, it is worth a try for the experience."
"The food here is always reliably good. As a former resident in the 'hood, it was a go-to spot for the kind of relaxed, affordable dinner out you want close by. I moved further away, but recently returned for a visit to my old haunt. The place has expanded! The once simple and quaint outdoor is now expanded to a covered tent-like structure (think outdoor wedding thingie with asphalt floor) which amplifies sound x about 20 new tables! It is deafening (no exaggeration) on a busy night - and not at all charming. Add to that, one bathroom for all. Really? Standing in line - in the restaurant next to diners - for 15 minutes?? With another bathroom and some sound absorbing stuff in the expansion area (plus a little more work at giving that area some ambience and charm) this loveable place would b"
Goog place for meat loaf and drinks. Expensive.
"Hot Doug's is the one and only sausage emporium in Chicago! ?Outstanding every time. ?I don't fault the johnny-come-lately (which we won't mention here) in Humboldt Park for joining the sausage-themed herd, but they have a lot to learn from the likes of Hot Doug. ?This place is so good I'm surprised there aren't a whole lot more sausage emporiums in Chicago, being such a food town, other than your typical beef shack. ?Thanks, Hot Dougie. ?We love you."
"I like it for a kinda-crunchy, cheap-chic date with, say, a philosophy PhD candidate or something. Would I bring my ibanker dad? Probably not. But would I come on my own or with a friend? Oh yes!"
"AWFUL - for $8.99 i almost walked out. ��There are certain things that are unacceptable when it comes to diners. ��First, crap food. 2nd Cold Food. 3rd Low quality. ��I actually think Burger King would have been better minus the meat. ��Eggs were flat, hard omelette like things that were way over cooked and hard. ��The home fries were deep fried nuggets that tasted like they had been sitting for a while and cold uncooked peppers on them. ��The fruit it came with was super thin and looked like it had come off the person's plate before me. ��The pancake if that is what it was -unedible! ��Really surprised there is a line out the door on this place some days. ��def. not a foodie joint. ��Go their only for the plaid wearing hipsters with tattoos - Not the food. I want my money back!"
SORRY !!!! i will never go back to these place ...food no good and service terrible and very expensive!!!!!!!!
"I would go here for brunch every weekend if it wasn't for that daunting line. ��Food, ambiance, location...all top-notch. ��Wish everyone else didn't know about it!"
"Doug = sausage Jedi. There are many places where the wait gets long, this is one of the places that is worth the wait. When friends come in from out of town I take them to Hot Doug's. The specials are always greater than the sum of their parts. Avoid the lines and go there at an off hour. I've been several times midweek before noon or after 1 pm and walked straight up to the counter. The duckfat fries are nice, but not worth the extra wait, the sausages will blow you mind."
fat elvis as rare as you can handle... trust me!
"Really good jumbo, Korean-style, fried chicken, Their bibimbop is also a great compliment to the chicken, and it's authentic (I'm half Korean). They just lose star for having hard napkins so be prepared to bring your own."
"This is my favorite restaurant. ��Period. ��I have been to a few other ��churrascarias to compare, but I keep coming back here. Come hungry... and you leave hungry, it's your own fault! ��Make sure to try a caipirinha too."
"I pretty much had the exact same experience as Kay B. I'm from Dallas, and I'm stoked any time I get to Chicago, the food is usually out of this world. Unfortunately I'm only in town for a night and I really could have done better. Ambiance: Cozy space with a lot of potential. Seems perfectly suited for a large party with plenty of room in the back. Staff seemed very attentive to the regulars and large groups who came through.Appetizer: The bread and Parmesan they bring out is mediocre. Won't ?spend time beating that up, just bleh. I ordered a Caprese salad which was plated beautifully, taste was average. Served with now balsamic, just oil and pepper. 2 starsMain Course: Asked for the chef's recommendation for the main course. The waiter laughed and said, So you mean my recommendation? He "
"Bad visit, sarcastic waiter. ��Waited close to an hour for what we thought was a deep dish special. He brought us a thin pizza. Manager apologized and said he would rush us what we ordered. Sarcastic waiter brought us a cheese and sausage, loaded w/tomatoe sauce. Ginos was a favorite years ago, but don't waste your time! Lou Malnatti's is the very best pizza, and we are thankful they have a pickup store in Geneva."
oh piece how i loved thee! went with my wife tonight and besides being as hot as an oven in the restaurant the pizza really was not good. I mean I'm a fan but tonight really wasn't good. Be careful piece it can happen real fast 1 customer at a time. I will try again since I feel this was a fluke but only 1 more time. The beer was good as always but man oh man what a letdown tonight!
"I am torn between a 3 and 4 star rating for this place...so I'll give it a 3.5.Had dinner at The Gage last night. Food was good, but a bit over priced for what we ordered. The mussels can't compare to Hop Leaf's, but the Gage burger was pretty good. The curry sauce was thin, which was disappointing. The decor was cool. I really liked their selection of tiles on the walls. Unfortunately, it was REALLY loud and hard to talk with companions, esp. at a table for six. It was a nice gesture when the owner, Billy Lawless, stopped at our table when I said 'hello' and he 'seemed' to remember us from his days at the Grafton. Worth a visit to experience all the hype for yourself."
Found this place randomly and fell in love! From the Saganki to their Chicken stuffed with sausage entree to thier deliscious Romanian beer-this place won me over. We also had the opportunity to hear genuine live Romanian music-all around gem in Chicago.
In this day and age not to have a decent beer list is criminal. When you get some decent beers I might come back.Whoever is running the 50% of the front business really needs to step up their game. This is not 2000 and not everyone wants to drink miller lite or $8.00 90 minute IPA's.
"Wow, this place draws a LOT of people! Do not go there if you're looking for a quiet night out, it is not going to happen! But, DO go there if you want to have an exciting night out, with lots of people and good food! Amazing selection of beers (the one I ordered was not that good) but hey, there are so many selections for a reason! One for each taste! I just did not pick the right one! The waitress was a little weird, like she was under the influence or something, but considering the crown and demand, she might have only been under the influence of stress. So, great, food, great beer selection (next time I will stick to the brands I know) and great atmosphere. They lost a start for me because of the poor service and impossibility to have a conversation without yelling!"
"It's a great place! When my friends come in from out of town, I take them here. It represents Chicago pizza very well. I did have a problem a couple of years ago. The watch must of gotten yelled at because she was flipping out on everyone. Must of had a bad day. Anyway, good food and atmosphere"
"A co worker took me here after finding out I was Greek, being new to Chicago I appreciated having some Greekness around me, she recommended Meli. The juice bar is superb, and the food was pretty good. Back home there are not that many Greek authentic places and it was nice that there is a Greektown here for me to visit when I miss Greek food. I had lunch and it was great. Breakfast seems to be the favorite but lunch is just as good. Definitely get something from the juice bar."
"Went to RJ's today. It was a beautiful 80 degree day in Chicago! Went here with my parents. We had the brunch buffet. The place was packed with people. All items on the buffet were super fresh and gourmet. Lots of cool things on there like israeli couscous, figs, fresh fruit, etc. My favorite thing on the buffet is the soup. It is to die for! It is well salted and flavorful, lots of good veggies in it. From there I moved onto the breakfast. Fresh made waffles paired well with apple chicken sausage and their bacon. Their bacon is the best I've ever had! They put some sort of seasoning on it. Freakin delicious! Also good were the eggs and denver scramble. I love this place and for 14 bucks cant be beat! Waitress was super friendly and attentive, kept bringing fresh bowls and plates. Definite"
"I've been going to Chicago Diner ever since I moved to Chicago. Over the years I have seen the service and quality of the food decline. My last visit was the final nail in the coffin for me. After standing in the rain for our names to be called for a table we were seated in their covered patio area. My friends and I were there for brunch and wanted to start our meal with a Mimosa, but we were told alcoholic drinks couldn't be ordered on the patio. After waiting for nearly 40 minutes for our food, we were given sub-par food that was flavorless and cold. Our waitress, Amanda, was too busy gabbing with her co-worker to check-in with us. At one point she asked if I needed coffee but never returned with my refill. I guess it was too hard for her to break away from her conversation to do her job"
Absoultely an amazing place this is one of our favorite spots to eat in the city. ��Food is great and priced reasonablly for the location. ��Service is great and friendly as well. ��My first time here I thought it was a little touristy but now I know why the majority of my colleagues recommend it to us. ��If you go you have to try the Avacado Chipolte Cheeseburger but make sure your save room for Desert
"Love this bar. ��I drink whiskey on the rocks and they have a great selection of whiskey. ��There are no TVs and no drink mixers, which is ok by me. ��I haven't tried the food yet, that will be a different trip!"
The best Greek Restaurant in the Chicagoland area....Esp. the octapus
"I had a wonderful time at Brazzaz during my trip to Chicago. At $45 a pop, it was still definitely worth it. The ""salad"" bar included items such as super fresh oysters, manchego cheeses and serano ham. Aside from the endless servings of meat (beef, pork, lamb, chicken, sausage, shrimp etc..), the place gives side orders such as fried bananas and polenta. The wine selection was also well chosen. The waiter comped our desert and coffee and provided exceptional service through out the whole evening. (I guess comping is common in Chicago to the surprise of this Bostonian).My one complaint is that the hostess did not mark that we honored our OpenTable reservation."
"Good Dog's, love the fries, been there forever. All I can say is try it!"
I love this place! It's a little expensive but I think it's worth every penny. The service is great and the food is delicious!!!
This place is a hype and needs to go. All of my fellow Mexicans agree that this place is tasteless and expensive. It's a busy spot but i feel like its people that are naive to good Mexican food and once they have good Mexican food they will realize how awful this place is. Go to Cabana de Don Luis on Lincoln and Foster. Its much much better.
"I have been going to Frontera Grill for ages - I think my first visit was in 1991. I have gone at least twice a year since then. I have consistently loved my meals - until my visit on June 11th. I know the drill - get there by at least 4:30pm for the 5pm restaurant opening. We did this. We were the 12th party in line. When the maitre d got to us (with his little clip board), I told him a party of 4. He informed us that the only seats were outside. This was a very muggy 89 degree day - so I asked when an inside seat would be available. He said 2.5 hours later. I grudgingly agreed to sit outside. After we sat down, a each member of my party went to see if indeed all tables were taken. They were not. And people who were not in front of us got seats. If they have a true no reservation dinner p"
I go here about 1-3 times a week and every time it has been an amazing experience. Simply its chicken fried rice is fantastic. I highly recommend this place. Also the owner is an extremely nice guy and is dedicated to providing exceptional service.
"Chicago q's was an experience!First, the pickles and chips were amazing: usually I'm not a fan of kettle chips, but these were perfect: they didn't get stuck in my teeth for hours, as usual.I split the pulled chicken and brisket sandwich with my brother: I have to say the chicken was very juicy, I just wish it had been cooked with the barbecue sauce. ��The brisket was also great: a tiny bit dry since it was cut into such small pieces, but it was still one of the best brisket sandwiches I've had. ��The cole slaw (my side) was great, but they gave so much I was getting sick of it by the end: but what did I do? Started mixing barbecue sauces with it in e end to switch u the flavor: it was amazing! ��The original and mustard barbecue sauces were the best: mustard not too spicy/horseradishy (which"
"Ok, there was a lot of hype I guess is the word for AOP around their stuffed and I had a chance to try it last night It was really good. I don't consider myself an expert when it comes to stuffed pizza but you could sit someone in front of this pizza and tell them with confidence that this is what Chicago Stuffed Pizza should look and taste like. Prices are average and delivery took a bit longer than I would have expected on a Monday night but that's no problem. I got a Cheese Stuffed Pizza, the cheese was great it was a little undercooked but I prefer that so that was to my benefit. A very good stuffed pizza will be having this again : )"
"The salad bar at this restaurant is FABULOUS!!! Oh my gosh, my boyfriend took me here this past weekend after we went to Lincoln Park Zoo and it was really crowded so we found a spot in the bar. Love the atmosphere!! Great bar tender!! Anyway when we finally got seated I indulged in the terrific salad bar while my boyfriend ordered a hamburger. To die for. Great burger and salad bar. When we told the waiter that it was our first time to eat there he came back with a complimentary dessert. Unbelievable and we will be back."
"at artop, a salad paired with an espresso fredo is king(the pizzas are awesome too)always warm/ welcoming servicelove this place"
"Good place to go anytime...Literally. I think they close maybe 2 or three hours a day. Good food, good atmosphere, and a great place to go to after a night of partying."
"Looking for a great place to grab a bite but not break the bank? ��Head to RJ Grunts. ��(Right next to Lincoln Park Zoo) We were just there with some friends. ��We all had something different, but everyone was pleased with the amount of food and the selection at the salad bar. ��(Try the French onion soup - yum or even the cream cheese and chocolate chips or the pulled pork sandwich - boy I'm getting hungry) ��no matter what you choose, you will be happy...and so will your pocket!"
"Really enjoyed hitting this place up this weekend. We got there at about 9 oclock and there was about an hour wait but there was a real nice open patio area where you can have some BYOB and chill. They also will get you stuff to make Sangria if you have brought the right stuff to mix. We chilled in the patio for about 40 min before there was an open table. The outdoor seating was fun, it was a beautiful night to be outside ... and we had some great food. We had the croquets as an appetizer and they reminded me of Spain. They have a very nice menu with a lot of fun options. It reminded me of some of the food we had in Puerto Rico which I love .. habichuelas, arroz, tostones, etc. I ordered the Cuban ... probably more of a lunch item but I have been craving a Cuban ever since I had one in Pu"
"I used to live across the street from this place, and I had no idea how spoiled I was! ��I miss it so much, especially being able to get the cafe con leche before going to work! ��It's great for any meal, they have amazing pastries, the sandwiches are great, my favorite was the cubano, and the dinners are great too! ��I still come here when I'm in the area, but I wish they would open one close to my new house!"
"Just what the neighborhood needs. ��Great food, chill atmosphere, awesome drinks and honest to goodness reasonable prices. ��We went last night and had three different dishes; the meatballs and brussel sprouts were great. ��I also enjoyed a PBR in a frosty goblet for a mere $2. ��The mixed drinks were great, too."
What's not to love? One of my favorite places in the city. If you haven't been here you should DEFINITELY go! Immediately if not sooner so you can enjoy the fleeting summer nights on the roof deck.
This place has the best Bourbon cocktails in Chicago. ��I have never had a more lovely Whiskey Sour on a chilly night. ��My girlfriend and I have been here three or four times and it just gets better and better. ��The food was extroadinary the meatballs we had for an appetizer were so delicious. ��I then ordered the pork belly and holy shit! ��It had to be the most savory thing I have ever had. ��It was crispy on the outside with a taste that tingled your taste buds and an even better texture on the inside. ��The chocolate creme brulee we had for dessert just completed the evening.
"I agree with some of the other reviews here when I say that the best parts of the meal are the appetizers, the drinks and dessert. My halibut entree was kind of bland as were some of my friend's entrees.HOWEVER, ceviches...yum, margaritas and specialty drinks were fantastico! and the tres leches cake was by far THE BEST I've had in Chicago (sorry Kristoffer's). Our server was really charming and funny without being over the top cheesy and was very knowledgeable about his recommendations.We had a great time here and the space is colorful and very fun with several different rooms and levels.I would definitely recommend coming here for a celebratory dinner."
"This place is great and the staff is even better. ?Don't come into Schwa with your typical expectations regarding the ambiance at a nice restaurant. ?The music was relaxed underground and urban, the food was very interesting and very delicious, and the staff was helpful and glad to explain each dish in detail."
"After many attempts to get a reservation last minute, we finally just went in late night and waited for a table. Not for too long I must say..plus I got to enjoy the white sangria at the bar which was great.I loved the ambiance of this place, much cooler than I thought it would be. The bast part of the whole experience was the food, which was amazing! This is a place I will eat at over and over again. The menu has a ton to choose from and I will definitely be back to try more items."
"Very good food, the bean cakes are espeically good! ��I also enjoyed the corn muffins. ��Be careful becuase this place gets very crowded on the weekends, so be prepared for a wait!"
"I had to do a review on this place.... best seafood in the city and so many options. Went on a Sunday at about 4pm, brunch was over (the menu that goes only until 3pm is great) and we were told so many reservations that we could not be seated until 8pm!!!!! I was a little shocked a restaurant would reserve the whole place and annoyed, but we sat at the bar to eat.We had a wonderful fish spread for an apptizer, but it was served with Ritz Crackers, yuck. We asked for the basket of crackers and ate it with those instead. For a main course, the fish pot pie was wonderful, warm, great crust but a little small in size for the price, but once I saw how many shirmp were inside, decided it was a good deal. Other meal was pretzel encrusted fish, so good. Only thing the veggies on the side were unde"
"The decor reminded me of a skittles explosion. Cool music. Empanadas were great. Fun ��place to go with a group. Mojitos were cool, first time I had one was here."
"ThE service here is really starting to suck. For what they charge, I expect more."
"We got to the Gage late on the Sunday before Memorial Day. There wasn't much happening but the service, particularly from Rebecca, was great. She is great and I will be back. The menu looks great and I can't wait to get back there for it."
"Great place...love the decor and the tasting menu was interesting with southern touches and excellent presentation. A steal for only $24. Waiter was friendly, but service was slow. Would go back again. The only other note is that this place is a bit on the noisy side so at times it was very hard to hear our waiter and vice versa."
"On a recent visit to Chicago, I was excited to have gotten a reservation at Alinea. I had heard a great deal about the chef and his food, and since I've yet to get a coveted reservation at Per se in NY (my hometown) I was eager to try Chicago's much-celebrated restuarant. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met, and the whole evening was a bit too contrived for me. From the sliding door upon arrival to the hushed tones of the wait-staff that take themselves way too seriously, the evening was a disappointment. The food was good, but not outstanding. You don't get a menu so you don't know what's coming out, and there's no full bar, so you really have to go with the wine pairings (which were very good). It's just as well, since it would be impossible to select a proper wine to accompany t"
LOVE! Been there multiple times for Lunch & Dinner. The Chips & Guacamole are a must!! as well as the Ropa Vieja...so delicious. Service is good.. I LOVE the photo booth in the basement & the whole vibe of the restaurant. Def a fav spot!
the food was very nice....all food are good...if they can give more beef for each order will be perfect
"Group of 7 on 5 de Mayo went in for some good Mexican cuisine, I was truly disappointed, the food was bland and the wait was 40 minutes when the waitress realized she forgot to put in our order, at that point we had to take it to go. ��The experience was horrible!"
Best breakfast I have ever had I think!! Everything about this place was stelar!
Great breakfast! A place with a really great atmosphere! Love the People and Love The Food!!!
"Last Saturday night my girlfriend and I ate at Mastro's for the first time and absolutely loved it. The food, the service, and the atmosphere were all great. Normally I would have gone to Ruth Chris but I wanted to try something different and was more than happy with my choice. As a matter of fact, from now on I will be going to Mastro's when I want a steak instead of Ruth Chris. To top everything off, the day after I dinned at Mastro's I received a call from them thanking me for coming in. ��Thanks for a perfect evening Mastro's!"
"There's been a lot of talk ��on this site about Zed, but did anyone know they serve brunch on the weekend? I was in town for a family reunion and my cousin took me to Zed for ""breakfast"" - wow, was that an understatement! There was so much food! The harvest stations, I think they call them, are filled with things like Italian french toast (made with panettone, of all things), and tons of different yogurts, fruit and desserts. And these chefs kept coming to our table with dishes like duck hash browns, crab cakes and fried chicken and waffles - I haven't had chicken and waffles that great since I lived in Louisiana! There was some great cajun spice on that chicken, just enough kick to combat the sweet maple syrup that comes on the waffle. I highly recommend you check out Zed for brunch - I ju"
"Excellent salad bar, wonderful service and great meat selections!"
"Delicious, unique food. Expect a 1-2 hour wait, but you can buy a bottle of wine and sit outside until you get a table. We had the pig ears, the foie gras, cheese plate and pork secreto, all of which were fantastic. The plates are small, they recommend 2-3 items per person. It's worth the wait!"
"I give it 5 stars!! We're regulars. ��I am obsessed with this place.I've heard that some of the meat dishes aren't as good, but I'm usually craving the vegetarian options when I go and I've never been disappointed with these.The shakes are DELISH. ��The vegetarian burrito is amazing. ��The sweet plantains are great. ��The ceviche is delicious.The customer service is amazing. ��Everyone that works there is always in such a good mood. ��I just love going in there.I don't understand anything less than a 5 star review. ��Even if you did have any complaints, the prices are so low!! If you compare the amazing quality to any other similar food you can get in the same price range, Irazu is the best!!!"
"This place is overpriced for what you get. The food is ok at best and the service stinks. I went on night with friends for late night grub and they were really stingy with the banchan and the grill barely worked. I wouldn't go back to this place. In fact I curse the place every time I drive by it to my girlfriend. She thinks it's hilarious, ha-ha."
"Place is one of a few good spots to have breakfast in the South Loop.Pro's- Food was fairly good- Large portions- Good coffee- Relatively cheap- Modern DecorCon's- Although you can't penalize a restaurant for this - long wait for table- Service was just OK (slow on refills)- Although food was tastier than your typical chain such as IHOP, there is better breakfast food in the Loop Area such as Lou Mitchells, Orange (now closed), and Eleven."
"I went here with my cousin a couple week ago. The food was absolutely phenomenal. The food was beyond tender and fall off the bone. We tried to split one of the plates down the middle, put a fork into one of the pieces, and it just fell apart on the spot it was so tender. Their single-malt scotch menu goes on an on. I am a huge fan of the food, and will likely go back. The only thing I don't like, which is a growing trend, is the plate menu as opposed to the traditional course menu, but it seems like something we will have to get used to."
"Came here for dinner on a Friday night and was absolutely blown away by this place! The food was phenomenal- we ordered a cheese platter and one of the three came with this pistachio truffle spread & omg I have never tasted anything like it! My boyfriend was raving about the bacon wrapped dates. I am a vegetarian and super picky at that, I was very pleased with the selection they offered and how much actually appealed to me, this doesn't happen often! Server was attentive and very knowledgeable. The GM was so sweet, I love female operated restaurants! A++ Mercat, we will be back!"
"This place is fantastic! ��The hot dogs taste great. You have to get it with everything. Mustard, relish, pickle...! ��I'm going to make this my first stop when flying into ohare. Oh, the fries are the best. Crinkle cut, crispy, and well seasoned."
"The first time I visited this place, I loved the food, and the service was good. ��So, for my birthday, my partner and I decided to get together with several friends of ours there. ��Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience. ��Our waitress mixed up our orders, and the manager-looking-guy came out and yelled at us that the mistakes were made because we did not tell our waitress our orders in the right way (e.g., from left to right). ��This guy even insulted one of my friends who was trying to explain what happened in a reasonable manner. ��He basically told her to shut up. ��We were all shocked how horrible we were treated. ��There is no way we will ever go back to the restaurant."
awesome! have a long island iced tea & pizza! we love it there
Thank you Rick Bayless for creating Xoco for the masses. I have never enjoyed a sandwich and a cup of hot chocolate as much as I have here. I wasn't so happy about the wait and the extreme crowdedness but it wasa good trade -after I ate. Can't wait to go again to try a different torta.
"Our Journey starts on a plane from Seattle, and could have very well ended at Violet Hour and I would have been happy. ��Finding the place was just the beginning of what added to the mystique in my mind. ��Marked only by a light and a door handle, the door almost eluded us. ��After passing through the large velvet curtains I felt transported. ��The tall blue booths, lovely marble bar counter, and a back bar full of the herbacious liquids I so desire...Violet Hour was nothing short of my idea of heaven. ��We came in from Seattle to celebrate my birthday...and the drinks I got there were the perfect dessert. ��I was in on Oct. 29th, and Thursday night, and it wasn't very busy. ��The bartender was fantastic, and made me a delicious negroni type cocktail and a mouth watering Manhatten. ��When I come b"
"OK, Viceory is the best in the suburbs, but this place is the best in the city. �� I have gained 3 pounds in last 2 weeks eating all that indian food. ��When i come to India house, i feel very happy. ��they do have some weird dishes that taste good, but overall my satisfaction with this place is good. �� bad? there has to be something bad about this place right? ��Well its kind of expensive at $15 for the buffet, and then i had to pay for parking. �� but its all good. ��love their pachranga dal. �� (dal made with 4 -5 lentils )This location is MUCH better than their location in Oak Brook. So I have found my fav resaturants in the suburbs and in the city."
"Ribeye was excellent. Service was perfect. made an e-reservation and noted it was my birthday. I didn't mention it at any point during the evening to see if they actaully read the note. They did, and brought out a freebie desert for us. Waiter even played coy, trying to make it a surprise. It was the perfect service that really made the night, very attentive but not a touch overzelous. Wildfire is a complete opposite to another Lettuce property, L Woods, which is horrible food and service. Things are priced right too. Even the bar had pub prices."
"This place is very festive and has great food. ?But some of their practices and thoughts about themselves are questionable.We went here for Nye dinner and a overall great time. ?However when we asked if they had salsa were told they don't want to be known as a typical neighborhood Mexican joint. ?Yet they have flan and tres leches cake on the menu. ?Figure that one out. ?For dinner one of us ordered the steak special only to find out from the receipt it was a whopping $70. ?The most expensive meal on the menu is less than $50 so I'm not sure how they justify that cost. Finally, every item on the Nye menu was 25% higher than what is posted online....and it was the exact same menu. ?I would call that false advertising but they can get away with it by the disclaimer prices subject to change ."
"I've only gotten food delivered from here but it was absolutely great.I was craving Pho noodles really bad so I searched for the places that serves pho here on yelp. Simply It was the first one on the result list.I checked their menu online, saw that it was reasonably priced so I gave them a call. The guy on the phone was really nice. I asked him how much the minimum was for the delivery and he said not to worry about it. I ordered the beef pho (I was craving tripe or meatballs but didn't see it on the menu) and avocado cream cheese wonton things. The delivery came very quickly and when I checked the contents inside, I saw a small styrofoam box labeled complimentary. When I opened it, to my surprise it contained an assortment of fruits (orange, pineapple, and strawberry). It made an awesom"
"I'll just cut to the tl;dr part. Great cocktails. ��Great bartenders.Too dark. ��Too fussy. ��Too expensive. ��And, perhaps, too impressed with itself."
"Yes, it was THAT good.My friend and I have a weird obsession with pancakes. We love them. We talk about them all the time. Heck, I even bought my friend a pancake magnet as a souvenir when I visited South Carolina recently. Obsess much? Saturday morning, we made our way to the Wicker Park location of The Bongo Room and waited outside patiently for a seat. The sun was shining brightly and our pale faces needed to see the light of day... me especially. After a short wait, we got our seat located at the bar and thus began our flapjack journey. Our waiter was incredibly sweet and accommodating and he even smiled and pretended to laugh along with our witty banter. Friend opted for the Orange-Ricotta hotcakes which were served with fresh strawberries and gingersnap brown sugar butter. Yum! She l"
This is a great restaurant to go to for That food and it is in a great location. My husband and I have gone here a few times for Thai food and there are times where right across the street there are festivals going on. It is also super convenient because it is right by both a train stop and a bus stop. Their pad thai is one of the best I have ever had. I am super happy with the food and the service. Would recommend.
"Me and my friends we had our first experience in a Brazilian Steak House on Tuesday the 31st ��and this place was amazing. From the hostess to the server Quite possibly one of the best meals of my life. ��The environment is really amazingwe had our chance to order wines and go to the salad bar which is amazing. There are so many items available it's hard not to get full before the meat comes. Our waiter �� name �� Juri ��I believe did phenomenal job paring our meal with different wines ,recommendations of nice cocktails to start with ��love the watermelon martinis (by the way ��the best martini ever)had a nice bottle of Riesling �� with our salad bar , and for our meats ��we had ��a nice cab ��from California The service was immaculate. ��The server or other employees were always there to assist and s"
"Let me be clear, this is a 4 star place, but my experience I had a ZERO star waitress.From the second we arrived she literally argued with us on everything. In a society in which we tip based on cost of food, not effort, who does that?We requested a seat away from the sun. The waitress sits us right by one of the huge windows saying its not even sunny out. Lady, if your room is lit by the sun and you can read, the sun is out. As we asked her about the items we were interested in her answers turned out to be incorrect ?in both quantity and contents of what was in the order.When asked how many eggs were in each item she gave a RANGE!. What recipe doesnt use a specific amount?The food, while not what we asked for was very good, however not worth coming back for for someone who acts like this."
"Fabulous veggie/vegan food, in a hip diner-style restaurant with a fun, friendly wait staff!! ��Gotta try the Chocolate Chip Shake!!!! ��You'll LOVE it!!"
"Food = FantasticPrice = Expensive but well worth it.Atmosphere = Very romantic but the lighting could have been better-I couldn't see if my food was cooked enough.Service = Great! One of the best waiters I've ever had! ��Also, when I called to make a reservation, they asked if we were there for a special occasion. It was our anniversary and unexpectedly during dinner the waiter gave us complimentary glasses of campaign and wished us a happy anniversary-great personal touch!"
"The Purple Pig is my go-to spot when I'm in Chicago. ��The menu is great and very pork-centric (obviously). ��I wont go into detail about all the things I've eaten, but only the ones that have definitely stood out. ��1. ��Bone Marrow - Decadent and delicious. ��Smear some marrow on the toast, sprinkle a little sea salt, the salad and you are in heaven. ��2. ��Pork Cheek with a fried egg. ��Let the yolk run over the pork. ��Enjoy fatty porky delictiousness.The staff is also very helpful and accommodating. ��When I arrived, the place was packed to the gills, but the hostess was very quick to find me a comfortable place at the bar. ��Any of my questions about the wine, food, or beer was also answered with apparent knowledge.This place is great for a meal of small plates, or just a couple of casual drink"
This place is definitely set up to capitalize on people's need to impress others with their chic and pricey dining preferences. I went here with a group of 6 good friends for a fun night out. The whole experience was not negative at all. But we left feeling a little hungry and a little irritated by the chunk of change we dropped. Expect creative parings like my scallops with oatmeal entree. Also expect small and pricey portions. And a very limited menu.My advice is to go here when a) your on an expense account and b) you have something to prove.
Delivery was quick. ��Pizza about as expected. ��Got a veggie stuffed pizza.
"This place have some really good thai food. :3 ITs not really that filling as Bens Noodles, but they both are good places to eat. Last time I been there was last year on April 23,2008 and I had there Yakisoba and it was good. It taste alot better than the Yakisoba you get at Wallgreens in those packages.I would receonmend this places because if its good food. ^__^"
"Great neighborhood place. ��You know you've found a great place when the line is out the door and no one wants to leave. ��Only bad thing: cash only.The food is cheap, plentiful, and some of the best Mexican food Chicago has to offer. ��The soups are fantastic, I love their enchiladas con mole con piccadillo. ��Maybe not an ideal first date kind of place, but if you love authentic Mexican - this is where you come."
"I had a good experience with the staff- they give a personal touch that's refreshing. ��They were happily accomodating to my party's various special dietary needs (no nuts, no seafood, vegetarians, etc)... They pointed out how I could save some cash on an event I asked them to cater. ��They gave careful reheating instructions and just generally took care with my order. ��For a large party- you can get family style for $12.50/person. ��Hard to beat that price in Chicagoland."
"This restaurant made for a great evening. Our server was very knowledgable on the different menu options and helped us pick out options for a diverse sampler platter to get a great taste for the restaurant's best dishes. The manager was very friendly and had a sense of humor. The honeywine was incredibly sweet. I personally was not a fan, but be sure to try it so you at least know what you are missing (or not missing). The setting is small and intimate. It is in a great location to go out on the town afterwards!"
"Delicious flat iron steak salad with just the right balance of dried cranberries' and browned onions' sweetness combined with saltiness from tender slices of flavorful steak. The steak was cooked perfectly, medium rare without much blood. Even though I am not a fan of Blue Cheese and forgot to tell the restaurant to hold the dressing, I enjoyed my salad greatly (after I tried to mask the light blue cheese dressing with Ranch dressing). ��The Shoe string fries (sans blue cheese for me of course) were lightly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and not too oily. �� The Hellman burger was ok (juicy and flavorful) but not as good as Islands or Red Robin burgers. ��It is slightly pricey but not unusual for downtown restaurants."
"Fogo de Chao is generally ��the main reason why we visit Chicago. I preffer Picanha in this location. I ate all around the world from Turkey to Spain, nothing tastes likes this. Also the salad bar is very rich. You will definitely be satisfied. Highly recommended!"
"The food was great and the service was fantastic. Omar, the chef, is culinary school trained and his passion for good food comes through as you watch him make your pizza. ��The customer service from Omar, Richie and Pedro (delivery guy) was great. ��We tried two pizzas with half and half: one Chicken Brasil (very good, very cheesy) & Marguerita (tasty, subtle flavors, nice fresh tomatoes on top) and the other was a Bar-B-Que Chicken (very good, especially since I wasn't sure of what to expect from BBQ sauce on pizza) & Pomodoro (also good, the black olives added a nice taste). ��I'd definitely go back for the pizza but I really want to go back for a non-pizza item as well; the roasted chicken with black beans and rice looked delicious!"
"I had dinner at Sunda last night and it was excellent. It is a very trendy, fresh place and I really enjoyed the food. The lobster and foie gras sushi roll was out of this world. I highly recommend it. We sat at the sushi bar and love the people watching. Good times!"
"Opart is wonderful Thai food with a beautiful splash of Thai culture. ��The decor is lovely, warm: exposed brick, traditional Thai art, cozy seats. ��The Neau Sa-Ded appetizer is so good: ��grilled beef cooked up tender in hot sauce. ��The fish dishes are quite good as well.Portions are more than enough for the low prices. ��I went with two friends for 2 appetizers and three main dishes and we were charged only 40 bucks!!!It's byob, too, which is wonderful bc the liquor store next door sells a couple of Thia beer selections."
"sushi is good and priced well for what you get but the service is horrible at best. The last time I was there, we were told an hour wait which turned into 2 hours. Once seated it turns out they had given our $25 bottle of wine which was in the fridge to another table and gave us a cheap bottle that was left in there. We received no comp for the mistake and no apology. After waiting for 2.5 hours, we were rushed through our meal b/c it was almost closing time. Shame on us for waiting that long. If i ever go back it will be for take out only."
"These are the best tacos in the city. ��I have also sat down and order ""wait staff style"" for a nice evening meal. ��Authentic, fresh and fabulous. ��I bring all my out-of-town guests here for some fabulous ""ethnic"" food.Not to be missed....and inexpensive!"
"excellent food at reasonable prices, friendly service. really enjoyed crab rangoon and the godzilla baba roll."
I love this place!
"Grand Lux is a great restaurant for a dinner date, families, going out on the town night. I went with my family, had an amzing drink, wonderful buffalo wrap appetizer and delicious salmon for dinner. It's also pretty good on prices and it's located right on Michigan ave. where all of the action is!"
I'm a huge fan of Simply It. ��The food tastes great and is affordable. ��The service makes the place. ��I've been on numerous occasions and always have an excellent experience.
Good eats! Will come back for more. thanks
"I went to Graham Elliot recently as part of my birthday celebration, and I could not be happier. ��From the friendly and accessibly service to the laid-back atmosphere, everything exceeded my expectations.And the food was no exception! ��I could list everything we ate that night, but as the menu changes frequently that doesn't seem necessary. ��Here are some highlights:The cocktail menu has something for everyone and every one I tried was delicious and unique. From the savory Peaches and Herb to the tropical Almost Paradise, they were all tasty and fun. Favorite: Blueberry Hill-sweet yet tart, lovely blueberry compote, I could have had four more!The sweet corn bisque could not have been seasoned better. Every bite was like a celebration in my mouth that I just wanted to eat and eat and eat. T"
"Had lunch here yesterday. Nice. ��Our sandwiches were good. The food at neighboring tables looked good. ��The sweets in the dessert case looked really really good (I'm on a diet). ��Pleasant dining room, but I wish they cranked up the air conditioning a bit. ��I also wish they had more salads to choose from at lunch time. ��They seem to be 90% sandwiches, 10% salads. ��Looking forward to going back for breakfast. ��Finally, the prices were quite reasonable and I like the age range of the clientele ranging from infant to senior."
"Milk and honey is decent for breakfast, I feel they're a bit overpriced and the food's so-so, but they do have good pastries and especially cookies. ��My favorite restaurant in the area is Picante, though. ��They have the freshest organic food you can find at reasonable prices and they're open late."
"I eat lunch at Meli every week, and I try to have something different each time. Nothing I've ever eaten at Meli has been average, everything has been really good or completely delicious. My favorite thing to get is their Cristo Melt that's on vanilla-battered challah bread. ��Great coffee and juice, and food always comes super fast.The service tends to be hit or miss depending on who you get, but it's always fast and I've never had a wrong order. If you go on Friday, just make sure you try and get there before noon. It gets packed."
"2nd time with Davanti Enoteca. ?Took my husband back because I liked the wine prices and tasty italian eats. ?In my book, there is only one way for this restaurant to get 5 stars...consider your music choices. ?While I am a fan of Crazy Train by Ozzy Osbourne & Barracuda by Heart, they dilute the dining experience at this lovely Italian find on Taylor. ?Please change the tunes :)"
"The food was decent at best, their portions relative to price are all over the place. Some cheaper items have a nicer portion and are better tasting than some items that are very expensive and small portions for tapas style food. Food was extremly slow coming out and we went during lunch on a weekday when it wasn't that busy so I can only imagine what the service is like when it gets busy. The place was avergage at best."
"My girlfriend and I were looking for a new burger joint to try, and we came upon RJ Grunts on Yelp. ��The place was packed, but we were able to get in right away. �� The restaurant has a laid back feel with 70's hits in the backdrop. ��They have a funny story describing how each item of the menu came to be. ��The food was good... the cottage fries were awesome. ��The service was absolutely first rate. ��Overall I would have to rate the total experience a 5 out of 5."
"My girlfriend wanted to eat duck so I figured I'd go to Sun Wah to carry out. I didn't know what kind of duck they had so i figured i'd give them a call. The lady who picked up the phone at Sun Wah had an accent and obviously was having some trouble describing the various ducks they offered so I decided to do her a favor and speak Chinese. I speak rather well but can't write it so as she spoke in Chinese I began writing as fast as I could in English. It's rather difficult translating Chinese spoken words into English words. Anyway, I asked her to repeat herself and she got rather abrupt telling me that she had told me X number of times what they offered and then hung up on me! I called back and this time a man answered. I asked him the same question and as he started to answer, he began to"
"The food is acceptable, but not very flavorful. One can do so much better in Chicago, so why bother?"
"i love jazz and when i came to chicago, i was told green mill is the best place to go. i totaly agree with this. the atmosphere is amazing . it's a little club where you can drink something and enjoy live music. they serve no food, but you are allowed to bring your own and eat it in there, i never saw that before. the people are very friendly and you get your drinks quickly. the live shows at 8 pm normally starts one hour later, but there's always someone playing the piano behind the bar. the stage in in the back and you have a very good few from all the seats. it's a bit far from the center of chicago, but it's totaly worth it."
"Superb!!!The smoked ham sandwich put me in heaven. It's the best ham on dark rye with provolone served with thin french fries and garlic mayo! The menu has a variety of flavs to choose.What ever your palate wants, get it. There are many choices of different hops from all over the world to drink!There is main flr seating for the ones who like a quick seat, outdoor seating for the wild and 2nd flr seating for on lookers. It's one great loft party with strangers without candy.This place rocks!"
"Went early so it was a bit empty when we got there. ��Service was excellent, except it seemed like the guys wanted to take the plates before being finished. ��Food was good. Liked the yellowtail jalapeno. ��Miso was just ok. Pork shank was cooked perfectly, and the rolls were fantastic. ��Will go back to try more."
"The bartender told me to write a bad review on Yelp so here it is. This bartender had the worst attitude ever. If Al Capone was still around and heard how he spoke to his customers, this bartender would be in the direction of Jimma Hoffa (AKA disappear from the face of the earth). All me and my girlfriend wanted to do was take a picture and the first thing he said was You're not even buying anything. ?He had not even given us a chance to order a drink before opening his big mouth. If this place keeps a bartender like this and chases its customers away in an economy like we have today, Green Mill will be closed before we know it. Only one can hope so we can save ourselves from such a nonsense business. Basically, people need to find a much better place to go. The bartenders who work here ha"
awesome food. hits the spot whenever i have a craving.
Best vegan shakes ever!
The Food is excellent but prices were ridiculously high. The place is nice but i would not recommend it before mentioning their high prices!
"Alinea was by far the most amazing food experience i have ever had in my life. Every detail was thought out from the chair you sat on, to the contraption that you ate the food off of. The staff was the most knowledgable food professionals i have ever had the experience to enjoy a meal with. They adapted their personality to you..ie. if you are a snob - they will cater to that. If you are down to earth - they will have a conversation with you. There are too many dishes to discuss here - literally i can't remember all of the courses. Yes it is very spendy, but worth the once in a lifetime experience."
So good. Always.
"Beers were just alright. Bacon fat popcorn was good. Burger was very good if not great. Overall only problem that I have is that it took about 30 minutes to get our food out on a Monday at about 2 pm. Also be prepared for about a half dozen guys sitting around the bar with thick black rimmed glasses, scruffy beards, and stocking hats on. It must be something they put in the beer to attract them all!"
First fondue restaurant I have been to and was a little caught off guard but then got into the swing of things. The food was ok I would like to try another fondue restaurant to rate the difference but overall I was not as impressed as others on yelp. Be prepared to pay for this expensive meal without seasoning and be prepared to cook it yourself maybe bring some seasoning in your pocket for some flavor. The best i will say is the dessert if I return I will only go for the dessert fondue.
Just want to mention that no one followed up with me after sending Gilt an email directly and posting this review. Awful service in my book.
"1st week in the neighborhood! ��New place, absolutely fantastic vegetarian food. Love it!"
"This restaurant over-delivered across every expectation that was already set by the two-star Michelin rating. ?All I can say is that the 'Partridge & a Pear Tree, Grilled Foie Gras and Saffron Ice Cream are all in the discussion for dish of the year in my book. ?Wow is really the only thing I can say to explain it."
"Best pizza and beer I've ever had! ��They don't take reservations for small parties but the wait is totally worth it, and usually not as long as they say. ��After the first time I went, I made 3 consecutive trips back. ��There's a reason this place is so full on a weekday!"
"La Villa is the best! I always end up going home with tomorrow's lunch because the portions are HUGE! The bread is amazing, and I love the thin crust pizza. I've never tried the salad bar, but that's because I love the soup!The staff is always super friendly and they remember you."
"Wow.I no longer live in Chicago, but XOCO is tempting me to move back.It's that good.I've only been twice, trying the Ahogada Torta and the Pepito Torta with an order of chips and guacamole both times. Both meals were outstanding. Both were seasoned perfectly. Honestly, I can't think of a single critique of either one. If I had to think of a complaint it's that the guacamole is simply average, not outstanding, and the portion of guacamole is meager. The hostess was very gracious, and although it was busy, things flowed along smoothly. Both times I've been, my experience has been great.If you're in Chicago and looking for a good lunch, XOCO is the place."
"If it were possible, this score would be a 3.75. ��Two years ago, that number would have been 4.75. ��My wife and I returned to Shaws with memories of an awesome dinner (on the casual side), and were pleased with this visit, but mildly disappointed. ��There was a cool little blues band playing, which was loud, lively, and fun. ��Not sure how often they have live music, but it was great (it was loud because we chose a table near the band).I started with a great martini...dirty and delicious. My wife was a little tipsy after one Cosmo, so it must've been pretty good.The food was only OK. ��I had a spicy oyster shot and loved it. ��Their oysters in general are really good...lots of variety and quite fresh. ��We ordered the market-price crab legs, too, just like two years ago. ��Here's the major diffe"
"The empandas were so delicious (creamy goat cheese, and goat cheese/guava served with an oil/cilantro concoction). And the veggie dinner plate was solid, with surprisingly flavorful grilled veggies. But maybe I wasn't in the mood that night for a veggie dinner plate; I can't help but feel like maybe i missed the boat and should have gotten a sandwich instead."
"I found this place on yelp and have been dying to try it for awhile now. Finally tried it over the weekend and the reviews we absolutely spot on. Despite the long wait, everything was perfect. We will definitely be regulars here!"
So I came here for the first a while ago with some friends after we heard them mention it on ER (not even sure if it's the same one) but we loved it. Great little Italian place with great ambiance. I usually try to make it here once a month. LOVE IT!!!
"If I had a grabber when I stepped foot onto the sidewalk outside of Hot Doug's after eating a couple of his sausages and the duck fries, I'd call that dying with dignity! ��Never disappointed at this place."
"Yumm yumm yummmThe big bad wold huffed and puffed and got the best wine and swine meal ever!!!I love love love this restaurant, i have been there maybe 7 time know and will continue to go! The beet salad, the eggplant and bread dish and he chicken thigh is sooo good, as well as all the other dishes i had but cant remembe the names for were delicious too. I love the decor i feel like im back in spain even though i would classify the restaurant as meditereanan tapas. regardless a must try in chicago!!"
"Good food but very small portions. ��If you are hungry you'd have to spend at least $30 on the small dishes to have enough (and that is not including drinks.) ��Our favorite actually contained no pork.....it was the Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde! ��The grilled octopus was very tender and flavorful. ��Other favorites: bread croquettes - but you only get 6 small balls for $5. Bread pudding with citrus - served warm and just the right amount. ��A great ending to our lunch. Misses: Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, PickledCherry Peppers & Fried Egg. ��The tastiest thing on this dish was the fried kale. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herbs. ��Interesting but would not order again because realistically the bone marrow had little flavor. ��Service was pretty good although we informed ou"
"I'm vegan, so I love their veggie tacos and killer guacamole here. The oatmeal shakes are also very good. This place is great, you can eat like a king for very little money. As busy as they always are, it's amazing that the owner always remembers my name. Its just a great find in the bucktown neighborhood. I've lived here for over 17 years and unfortunately only discovered this place about 5 years ago. It's so good I've heard people want to keep it a secret. Also, if you come definitely get the mashed potato tacos...awesome."
"We were out of town visitors and we heard this was a deep dish pizza place. We received the recommendation from the concierge at the hotel. We were so disappointed with both the pizza and the service. First, we were told it was an hour and a half wait for a table for two. We decided to stick it out and waited...it was crowded which in our minds confirmed the reputation of having amazing pizza. They did allow us to place our pizza order early in advance of being seated (after an hour and 15 minutes of waiting). All of a sudden, after two hours, we're still waiting to be seated, when and we notice people who came after us getting a seat. When I checked on our seating, they had sloppily written my name wrong and called the wrong person. OK..fine. So next, we get seated without even a hasty ap"
"When we asked everyone where we should go for some Chicago-style pizza, the answer was ""Giordano's."" And this place did not disappoint. We ordered the tomato, basil, mozarella appetizer...so so delicious! Then we ordered the mushroom stuffed pizza. The wait is 35 minutes to get your pizza...and the waitress warned us about this....but the wait is totally worth it.The pizza was absolutely delicious. I'd recommend it :)"
"Yummmmm! I love the hot dogs and the french fries! ��The kids love the chicken. ��This is one of our favorites!!!SOmetimes it gets really crowded and it is hard to park my van, but I love to go there. ��We don't go as often as I'd like because it is kind of pricey."
Great beer selecton! ��Enough said!
"The best service and Italian that I have eaten in the city. ��The first time I ate at Sapori we were seated by the kitchen (my fault for making reservations 10 minutes before). ��Although the seats were not ideal the staff made the experience well worth it. ��The owner actually brought out free appetizers and dessert for the entire table, as well as offering to re-seat us several times. ��Not only was the service excellent the food was AMAZING and the portions were large. ��You definitely get what you pay for and more. �� Lastly, about a month later I received a handwritten letter and a $14 gift certificate in the mail which was signed by the cook/owner. ��I recommend this place to anyone and everyone in the mood for a good meal and great service."
"Stopped in for breakfast on Memorial Day before rolling out of town and I will definitely be back. ��I ordered the simple two-egg breakfast (though I substituted a can of Half Acre for PBR) and was impressed with the quality and taste of the sausage and potatoes, not to mention the refreshingly cheap price.I will be back."
"Even though the service at Garcia's is slow, slow, slow, I always return (when I can fit it into my schedule). ��I love their salsa and their burritos are the largest I've even seen!"
"I had the worst service experience of my life here. My friend complained because it took almost an hour for them to make our pizza. I understand that these pizzas take a while to cook and a long wait is the norm, so I wasn't going to make a big deal about it, but it mattered to my friend. The manager reacted in the most immature, angry way, to the point of being verbally abusive. My friend continued to firmly but politely push his point. The manager was throwing around curse words, getting in my friend's face and all but hitting him. It was totally unexpected and kind of scary. Then the manager ripped the pizza out of my friend's hands and charged his card back and yelled 'THERE, now you can go wait somewhere else for your meal!!'. He continued to verbally abuse us as we walked out in a st"
"The place was as everyone reviewed, big portion and lots of taste. I'd go again. Good experience."
"I thought this restaurant was going to be good considering the two great restaurants before it (Thyme and Timo). ?We got to the restaurant about a half hour before our reservation and it didnt seem too packed, even though the bar/reception area is tiny. ?We went to the bar and asked for two different glasses of red wine. ?They were out of one of the glasses we requested, so we selected a different one. ?5 minutes later and they were out of the next bottle as well. Oooook, didnt this restaurant just open up? ?So my boyfriend asked the bartender, Ok why dont you just tell me what you do have and we will start from there. ?She promised everything else was available, so we selected another glass. ?That was out too. This was extremely irritating, I just wanted my glass of wine. ?Is that too muc"
"I have been coming to this place since I was a young child, as a person who was raised with home made Italian food I am extremely picky. The Venue is older looking and dark inside, but has some real authentic charm to it. The staff is extremely accommodating and courteous. Like I said, I know real home made Italian food and have never been unhappy with any of their courses. Make sure to make a reservation well ahead of time as this place packs up very quickly, they even have some nice outdoor seating now for the summer time. Try the baked clams, chicken vesuvio, and any veal dish. Manga!"
"I absolutely love their rice bowels. My sister and I order them about once a week. My favorite is the vegetable bowel. It looks like too mush food, but before I know it, I've got it all mixed up, added their dressing and it is gone. My sister enjoys the silver haze bowel. We've had their $10 sushi lunch specials too. Excellent food and staff!"
"Fresh yellow watermelon punch with sparkling water and blueberries..so, so refreshing! Great breakfast options like the benedicts, especially the Nanadict, served on a pupusa corn flatbread with homemade chorizo. Or their waffles, like the corn oat with Greek yogurt and fresh raspberries. UGH!! Other interesting options? Banana-hemp cakes and other whole wheat cake concoctions that change out in a timely manor. Great organic food!"
"I'll keep this simple: ��if you are impressed by fake Italian food that you could easily make at home yourself, a cramped loud space with no waiting area, and a ridiculously rude manager with a Napolean complex who likes to inform people that unless their entire party is exactly, to the minute, on time, you will lose your reservation, then Caro Mio is for you. ��I actually saw this happen to two groups of people, and the sad thing is the restaurant was less than half full. ��Oh, and byob? ��Big deal, your own home is byob too, and you don't have to listen to some jerk up on his reservation high horse."
"I know that everyone seems to be completely enamored with Alinea. ?It was certainly a memorable experience. ?Probably the most expensive, memorable experience that I never care to have again. ? It was incredibly innovative, many dishes were flavorable and absolutely everything is done with the kind of focus and attention that you would expect from arguably one of the best restaurants in the nation. ?But I do not care to do this again.My parents were in town and I wanted to share something really special with them, so took them to Alinea. ?Wanting the occaision to be a truly grand experience, we all had the 25 course tasting menu with the sommelier wine pairings. ?With tip, the bill was over $1,800 for the four of us.Perhaps my feelings about the restaurant would be somewhat different if we"
"Where to begin...what an awful experience...food was terrible...service was worseLet me preface that I travel about once each year to eat at BBQ destination..last year Kansas City...year before Austin...etc...My favorite Chicago BBQ is SmoqueI ordered carry-out from this restaurant...was told 20 minutes...showed up and they forgot to enter my carryout...I actually watched the lady behind the bar enter my order, then turn to me, and tell me that what she was doing was a formality and my order was already entered...she actually just lied to my face...terrible customer service...after waiting a total of 1 hour for my food, it was nothing but disappointing....baby back ribs were terrible...hominy salad was tasteless...only decent item was baked beans with brisket...STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE..."
"I really liked this place. coming from the Bay Area, and being around so many wonderful mexican/latin restaurants I really wanted to find one out here and I sure did, I like the neighborhood, and ofcourse I really liked the food here. They greet you so kindly when you come in, the patio is nice- who doesn't like that? ��and the margaritas are super good"
"Fantastic time. ��6 of us wandered in looking for a bite before the Cranberries show. ��It was pretty crowded but they somehow got us seated in under 5 minutes. ��We were all pretty new to Ethiopian so we let the server order for us and it was a feast.Plus, it turns out that if you show them your ticket to a nearby show, they knock 5 bucks off your bill.Will definitely be back."
"We are out of towners from TennesseePrice: Go expecting to spend some cash. ��My wife and I threw down $120 after tip for king crab legs, lobster roll, and two drinks.Attire/Mood: What we didn't know was that this place had two different dining areas with two different moods and attire levels. ��The main restaurant was business casual and the raw bar area was come as you are. ��T-shirts and flip flops were seen, and also a live jazz band was present. ��Mood was more formal in the main area. ��The raw bar was sit wherever the waiter puts you. ��We sat with a group of four on a tall bar table and was able to socialize with some locals. Was fun, but they do have a couple of boothsFood: Last but not least the most important part, how was our dinner? ��The food was great, my crab legs were sweet and t"
"I LOVE GLENN'S!It's as simple as that. ��I still haven't been there for dinner (which I keep saying I will do, one of these days). ��But it's great for a weekend brunch. ��I've tried several of their breakfast dishes and haven't had one bad meal yet. ��I'm not the kind of person that likes to wait to be seated but I would wait for an hour to eat here. ��But, you get seated right away with a reservation so it doesn't have to come to that. ��Sometimes I dream of their giant Bloody Mary that comes with a shrimp skewer and honeydew. ��Yes I said honeydew. ��Sounds kinda weird, but totally works. ��Also, they have a nice outdoor seating area on the sidewalk when the weather cooperates.Did I mention I love Glenn's. ��Can I give it 6 stars?(Oh lord, I have salivated all over my keyboard.)"
"one of the best burger spots in Chicago, hands down!"
"Be aware that this place gets crazy on the weekends! Not that it stops the good food or the good service. However, there was one time I went with my husband and the waiter was clearly swamped (I had some sympathy). We waited too long for our toast, and then our check, but the waiter brought over for both of us Yolk's two large super tasty hot chocolate. So, I forgave him. :) If you go, go very early or go after 11, when its not so crazy. The food is like upscale diner food: great omelette's, the coffee is actually good, fresh squeezed juice, just overall great and tasty. My last trip I had their eggs Benedict, and I cleaned my plate."
"Delicious! The drinks from the bar were tasty, the food was innovative and all you would expect from the culinary genius himself."
This place has gone down hill in the last year and the managers have no problem serving over cooked and or old meat! Won't be going back here...now a waste of $50 for 2!
"Stumbled upon this terrific restaurant 2 months ago when I moved to the neighborhood and I keep coming back!!! The food is terrific, I have had everything from their famed Mac n Cheese to their Black Bean burger and I have never been disappointed!! ��My friends and I were in on Saturday for Wilde's big St. Paddy's Celebration. We had a blast!! The music was pumping, green beer was flowing and amazing Irish food!! What's not to love? Being in the Industry myself, the staff did an amazing job. From our waitress to the hosts, bar staff and back of house, the staff was definitely on top of their game. Especially for how crazy busy they were!! It pains me to see bad reviews on this establishment, especially over this past weekend with the craziness that is St. Paddys weekend.First off ,you're in"
I like to think that my wife & I are still in our prime when we can go on a Saturday night drinking binge and still get the munchies at 2am. Their burrito is amazing. So big that it served as hangover breakfast in the morning. Burritos & bloody mary's. Still young!
"The worst, worst, worst Vietnamese restaurant I have ever been to. This restaurant with all the reviews are for foreigners and/or non-natives who has never been to a Vietnamese Restaurant before and/or have never had Vietnamese food before. The noodle soup is bland. The glasses are dirty, with water spots, oil spots. I am glad it failed inspection because it is filthy there. The service is terrible. I will never go there ever again. The restaurant is by far the worst restaurant I have ever been to, it is filthy, noodle soup is bland, and other dishes are flavored disgustingly. There are much better Vietnamese restaurants in the area. This is the worst Vietnamese restaurant in the area of Chicago, and this restaurant will definitely not survive in California. It is doing well because there'"
"I'm not one to throw around 5 star reviews but as far as Mastro's is concerned I am having a difficult time finding a reason not to. Awesome steak, great drinks, great atmosphere. The service was outstanding for how busy they were. Everything came fast and the waitress was helpful. She was not overbearing like some tend to be at fancy places, and only came to the table when she needed to.I started with the tuna tartare and sea scallops. The presentation for each of them was beautiful, and I was pleasantly surprised by the serving size of the tartare. ��I had expected a small dish and it ended up being a pretty large portion. The tuna was very fresh and flavorful, and despite it being larger than I had originally anticipated, it was still a very light dish and left me wanting more.The scallo"
"BEST PLACE EVER. I absolutely love this place. My family and I are big Rick Bayless fans so we just had to try this. We were forced to schedule our 2 month in advance reservations after we found out we had to wait 3 hours to be seated one Friday evening. After much anticipation the day finally arrived for a dinner for 4 at Frontera. The waiter was very attentive and the atmosphere was very lively. Unfortunately, I cannot remember the exact names of the items we ordered, but I do remember their main components. Anyway -we began by ordering 2 appetizers: the Sopas and Tamales. They were amazing and I could not get enough! ��We also ordered drinks. My sister ordered some type of jamaica juice and I ordered a tequila cucumber (some type of margarita): both were delicious! I could have had 10 mo"
"Don't get me wrong, the food at Xoco is amazing, and that's part of the problem! I want and expect a lot more. A $12 sandwich should have about three times the amount of meat served on my Pork Belly Torta. The deliciously-tender salsa negra topped pork was barely noticeable hiding between the halves of the crisp wood-oven toasted bread.Yeah, yeah, local and all-natural ingredients drive up the price, but seriously, don't be so skimpy! Next time I want salsa negra pork belly, I'll make three pounds of it at home for the same price (with Bayless' own recipe) and eat myself silly!"
"It was hard to find a low key, chill Mexican place with good food and good margaritas. We stumbled upon Mayan Palace using Yelp and have been back several times since.It is your typical mexican fare, good priced food and drinks and as many chips as you can eat. The salsa is also pretty good, kind of has a kick to it. I always get a combo platter so I get a bit of three different items, which come with rice and beans. I haven't taken out from here but my friend has and said it was pretty good. I particularly liked the cheese enchiladas.Parking is street parking...and available most of the time."
"I went to Ruth's Chris for the very first time a couple of weeks ago, and I must say that I lOooooooooooved the food! Service was also great! The Fillet Mignon and Lobster tail were to die for! The Martini's were also mixed to perfection. I would def recommend this restaurant!"
"We tend to think of Spacca Napoli as an extension of our apartment, since we live right across the street from this beloved, neighborhood pizzeria and frequent it regularly with friends and family. ��Walking into ��Spacca is also about as familiar to us as walking into our own kitchen. ��Jonathan (the owner) is always as welcoming as an old friend and I don't think I have ever NOT been offered a complimentary appetizer or glass of Prosecco while waiting for a table on a busy night. ��In all honesty, our apartment's proximity to the restaurant was actually a selling point for us when we were looking to move to the neighborhood. ��That's how fond of Jonathan's establishment we are. ��I haven't tasted pizza like this since I studied abroad in Italy in college. ��Tasting Jonathan's pies for the first"
"This place is great for anything from dinner with the parents to a night out in the neighborhood for drinks. ��The large leather chairs and darker, browsing room/library feel is a huge plus. ��I've also been told they have a high quality sound system.In terms of food, everything I've had here is delicious: iceberg wedge salad, mac and cheese, portobello mushroom sandwich, chop salad, spinach cheese dip (YUM!), and the apple crisp dessert (YUM YUM!). ��The only down side is that there aren't many non-breakfast options for vegetarians on the brunch menu.Another huge plus: awkward date people watching. ��For some reason every time I'm there, there are a bunch of couples that seem to be on awesomely bad dates."
l
"This is one of my favorite brunch spots. ��The skillets, wraps and feta breakfast sandwich are all very good. ��Sometimes there is a long line, but it moves pretty fast and the wait is worth it."
"Good for kids: The info on Yelp says no, but every time I've been here there have been lots of kids, mostly babies and toddlers. So I would say it definitely IS good for kids. Plenty of high chairs available. Limited space though, so watch out for those giant strollers.I'm giving 3 stars because the last couple of times I've been here the place has really disappointed. The huevos rancheros were rubbery and seemed pretty obviously microwaved. The waffle was lukewarm and rubbery. The fruit was soggy, as though it had been sitting around for a while. Nothing seemed fresh.I also question their ingredients. They don't use anything organic, not even milk. The ""all natural granola"" IS delicious, but again it's just all-natural (which it should be, considering it's granola) but not organic. Not th"
"Great restaurant! I had dinner there the other night and WOW what a terriffic meal. The only thing better than the meal was the service... When you go there ask for Omar, he's one of the owners. Get him to turn you on to some of his private stash of juice. No kidding, if you're lucky enough to get some, it's a treat!Either way, this is a reat place for breakfast, lunch or dinner (business, casual or intimate). Enjoy."
I liked the services offered by (Alinea) restaurant and will definitely come again and again whenever i get a chance or ceremony to come in.
"YUMMMMM!!! I bought an apple tart or something like that. And, I totally inhaled the pastry in seconds. OMG!!! This is SO good. Everyone who works or lives nearby knows this place.Heck, I should go there now..."
"i am not sure what kyung was talking about. ��no chicken will compare to the standard from korea. ��NYC /LA is not the best either. ��not sure where she gets this information. ��ignorance is defintely a bliss, for closed mind folks. ��enjoy!! and im glad that crisp is finally in the lakeview area. ��travel to chicago for work from nyc and it's nice to stop by."
"My first Rick Bayless restaurant, and my first Yelp review. I had the Mole Poblano special on a Thursday. It was delicious! The atmosphere was fun, the service was friendly, and we got to sit outside on a warm summer evening. Do you need anything else?"
"This was my first time trying this restaurant since I had heard good things. ��When I explored the online ordering, I was impressed with the ease of ordering and what appeared to be an accurate representation of when the food would be ready (over an hour since we ordered chicken). ��I think the food was ready much earlier than the time on the website since it was barely warm when we picked it up 10 minutes BEFORE the time noted. Also, they forgot the drink that was included with one item so I had to remind them. The worst part was that when we got home I noticed we didn't get the all white meat on the quarter chicken (and paid an extra $1 for) and they didn't include the extra side of corn that we paid for. When I called in to complain the first response was ""whoever took the order didn't ma"
Best pizza every time. I never leave there dissatisfied. Service can make you feel a little rushed as sometimes they do a drive-bye as they take your order. But it doesnt overshadow the amazingness of the end product.
4 1/2 Stars - Gilt really is delicious and they have definitely upped their game in the service department. ��The mussels entree is just divine - the sauce is delicate and memorable. ��I will also add that their gimlet is amazing. ��I only hope that next time I have enough room to try the coconut pie - which looks absolutely sinful!
"This place has a really cool atmosphere.The decor is totally modern, creative and chic. The chair backs are probably 6 feet tall and very trendy.The drinks are tasty and the atmosphere is calm and relaxed.Even though there was only a handfull of people inside, a line existed outside...I guess they want people to want to come in!"
"This place is amazing! ��Some of the best fresh food of any type of cuisine. ��We have dined in and ordered take out and it has always been exceptional. ��The owners are always really great and throw in freebies when we order take out. ��We have always gotten fruit and last night they included Pho at no charge. ��I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone looking for a great, fresh, healthy and delicious meal."
Man This is the spot!!!!!Best Horchata EVER!!!! Best Chips and Salsa EVER!!! (nice and warm all the time)Ok maybe the service can b alittle more attentive but everything else is AWESOME!NACHOS!!! thumbs upGarcia's num 3 (combination plate) Ohhhhh YeaHHHHH:D keep up the good work!!!
"I with there was an option to give negative stars. The store is dark and dirty; the antithesis of Mariano's which is light and airy. I know it's supposed to be a loft, but it is just so dusty and grimy. The ramp is always dirty, and for awhile, there was even a large sheet of particle board just sitting on the ramp. ��The shelves are empty and if you like something, you should buy as much as you can because you will never be able to buy it again. I found some amazing rosemary crackers, but on my next visit, there were no more. So I asked a manager if they could order a few boxes; that I would take 5-6 boxes if they go through the trouble of ordering soem for me. But every time I followed up about my special order, the response was always.... ""check back ��tomorrow... maybe next Thursday... c"
Absolutely Loved it. Very different experience from anything else I've been to in Chicago. ��The food is fantastic and the drinks are very well thought out. ��We actually left our table in order to go see our drinks be made. I would say that is a must. ��The mix-ologist/ bar-tenders know exactly what they are doing and they put great detail into every drink. It's almost like you are on vacation and you are getting special treatment because you are a special guest. My eyes took a little time getting use to the light because it is all candle lit. The candle light just helps make Violet hour more unique and brilliant. I love telling people about my experience there and that's the type of place you want to visit. I've never been more impressed as I was at Violet hour. I love trying new things and
"i love this place especially cause you can kinda get your own ""private"" booth. ��i also love the fact they use real charcoal, too bad they don't allow that in the burbs. ��lots of side dishes and kalbi was great!"
"Absolutely INCREDIBLE!! ��You MUST get the guacamole and limonada. ��I would go back every day just for that. ��We had one of caldos and one of the tortas, and they were both delicious as well! ��The only downside is that I don't live in Chicago and go all the time!!"
I LOVE the salad bar of the brunch!!!!!But the slamon was soso~
"We've lived in Andersonville for 5 years and have taken all of our out of town guests here for Chicago deep dish. ��Tonight they messed up our pizza order - forgot the pepperoni (the manager claims there was pep, yeah, no way - 3 adults agreed there was no pep and even the waitress saw no pep). ��We had two small children with us and instead taking the waitress up on a remake we decided to eat it and avoid impending child chaos of waiting another 20 minutes for a fresh dish. ��Then the bill came - $1 off of an incorrect order on a $80+ tab (2 pizzas, kids meals, 3 drinks). ��When we asked if they could make it right (maybe discount us the $3.25 per topping after 1 topping rather than the $1 for the first topping? Comp one of the drinks or a kids meal?) the manager was extremely unhelpful. We'l"
"Love the food and the staff! As a musician, we almost always play here when the band is in town. They treat the musicians great; the venue is nice & intimate, and the sound is great!"
Very yummy The chocolate crepe is fantastic!
"Carefully crafted drinks in a cozy, quiet, intimate atmosphere. The bartenders know what they're making, mixing ingredients (some home-made) to concoct the perfect cocktail. I love this place dearly. In my opinion, it's the perfect bar. The music is always good, the drinks and little foods are always good. The service is friendly (and many of the bartenders are enthusiastic about their creations) and chill."
BEST breakfast ever!! Juice is AMAZING!! STAFF IS AMAZING! try the steak and eggs and you will fall in love! They have amazing crepes as well. This place is without a doubt one of the best restaurants in Chicago!! The owner is always around too making sure everything is satisfactory!! Youll love it!
"I've been a customer of Glenn's since they opened up. ��It's definitely the place to go for fish in the Lincoln Square/Ravenswood neighborhoods. ��But lately it seems like they've become a victim of their own success. ��The food has become inconsistent and the service mediocre at best. ��My last experience included a very offensive comment made by one of the staff at the restaurant. ��Something I might expect uttered at a restaurant in the south, but not in Chicago. ��That along with the ridiculous if not impossible wait times to get into the restaurant have me looking for a new destination for fresh fish in Chicago."
"Free Valet, Reasonably Priced, Great time, excellent place to take a date"
"Over the last year my husband and I have been on a burger kick like the rest of the world. We have been all over the city and suburbs trying gourmet burgers from high-end restaurants to city bars to chains with claims of great burgers. We have found many great places. Some we have had huge waits for, some were over priced, some we loved, and some we hated. ��We loved Lockdown and decided to go back a second time before we reviewed it. The first time there was a concert playing, but this time we got to catch the 2nd and 3rd periods of the Blackhawks game. We split two appetizers and the Big House burger recommended by our server. ��The mac & cheese rocked, the wings were good, and the burger was as good as any of the great burgers we have enjoyed in the last year. Even the mound of fresh cut "
"What makes Simply It among the best is Tuan Nguyen and his attention to detail. I've been to Vietnam a number of times and I am impressed with this restaurant's many vegetarian, tofu, seafood and meat dishes. My favorites - curry mussels or chem chep ca ry, banh hoi tom nuong (grilled shrimp with pasta) and ca kho to or catfish in a claypot. BUT mostly I have curry duck (extra hot). Always fresh ingredients as well as niice touches before and after a meal. BYOB."
"Simply It was absolutely wonderful! We were greeted with genuine enthusiasm and the promise of complimentary egg rolls! There was maaaybe a five minute wait and I think this is how we earned our treat. ?The food was great. Egg rolls were delivered seconds after we were seated. Two friends had different tofu appetizers that were both lovely. As for me, my meal was served in a coconut! The Coconut and Mango Beef (Bo Dua) had very tasty, very tender, very flavorful beef tenderloin with fresh mango, young coconut meat, snow peas, and red pepper and was perfectly sweet and savory at once. The waiter may have giggled at me when I ordered it, and I get that there's a bit of spectacle to this dish (and shamelessly admit, aside from the excellent ingredients, that it helped draw me in), but goofy o"
love sabatinos. been going there since a was a kid and still do to this day. wonderful old school atmosphere and excellent food. great service too.
"Yuppiest place on earth? I used to like coming here, but it's turned into a daycare."
"I love this place. ��Great Pizza, great beer, great service. ��Lost a star for the overprice though!"
"Oui! This is ultimate high end comfort food. if you go, do the grand collection with a wine pairing which is a great value. You get to enjoy (2 oz pours) of some very special wines like 1985 vouvray moelleux le mont domaine huet . It is an $85 retail price chenin blanc that I could sip all day..I agree the dated and muted ambiance leaves something to be desired but the food and staff quality speak for themselves."
"Just came back from a business Chicago trip. Somebody recommended this place as Chicago Iconic. Well, their hot dog was good, the toppings and sauces were great but their fries were the worst I have ever eaten. There was no flavor in fries, no taste and they felt like paper. Next time we'll try something else or just the hot dog without fries."
"What a wonderful surprise. Went to Demera just because we were hungry after a concert at the Riviera and they were close and open. ��Had only eaten Ethiopian food once, long ago, but I was hungry enough to give it another try and I was not disappointed.We were seated within five minutes despite the flood of patrons coming from the concert. ��Service was prompt and super nice. ��Just as we were about to place our drink order, the owner came by with a tray of free samples of the homemade honey wine. ��It was so good, we ordered a bottle.At his suggestion, we started with some chicken sambussas - crispy, flaky turnovers with a sweet spicy sauce (move over empanadas).We let our server - who was also from Ethiopia - decide the rest. ��There was lamb and tilapia, lentils and collard greens, some spic"
"I took a good friend to the Bongo Room today for her birthday. It was a most unpleasurable experience. The atmosphere was dirty, the hostess was rude and I was incredibly disappointed. Do not eat here."
Awesome definitely go back again food is worth the bill service and atmosphere delightful
The food was good but it wasn't Great. Not worth the price tho. Unless you have a lot of money to throw around.
"Let me start off by saying that I have NEVER written a bad review about a restaurant. ��Generally speaking, my thoughts are that things happen and for the most part my past bad experiences at restaurants have not warranted such an extreme act (as I see it). ��I like to focus on the positive. ��In this case, I can't get past the service. ��I am giving this restaurant 2 stars because the food was pretty good ��and the atmosphere was cool and interesting. ��However, the service needs some serious help. ��Our waiter was clearly disinterested to say the least but he's not the reason for my beef. ��During our meal (albeit towards the end of the meal) a manager actually had us move tables so that they could sit a larger table. ��Again, this alone is not my beef. �� ��Who really cares, I can stand up and mov"
"if I could give this place a 0, I would. after being told it would be a 45 min wait, it was really 1 hr., 45 min.any pizza lover knows the secret of a good pizza is the crust and cheese texture. ��Crust like cardboard, cheese like silly putty. ��it was obvious they and cooked the pizza early and reheated hit when we finally got to our table.we had the thin crust and it was still over a 1/4 inch thick. ��veggies on one of our pizzas tasted terrible. others in our family went to another location and had the deep dish. ��they were very disappointed too.will be sure to tell anyone we know visiting Chicago to never go there."
"I've written about Kinzie Chop House last year and gave it 4 stars. ��This place DESERVES a 10~! It's to bad I can only give it a 5. Let me start out by saying Elyse Cowles is hands down the best host one could have. She has always made my stay there seem like I was home. When friends and family visit, Kinzie Chop House is always one of the place we stop to eat. I would like to thank Elyse for making me and my family feel welcome even when I forget to make reservations. I had one bad experience where I make reservations at another restaurant (GILT) and the other restaurant (GILT) had the days mixed up and weren't very apologetic.. If you are on Kinzie, stop by the Chop House and receive a warm welcome."
"We come to Chicago about once every three months. We have a rule...We don't eat at the same place twice. Sunda is our first violation of our rule.Great sushi, Great meals, Great service.We'll worth breaking the rules for..."
Great meal !!! If you like chicken wing you have to check this place out. I had lunch here with my brother and ordered the spicy BBQ sauce and the Seoul sassy. They both were very very good and tasty. They were nice crunch to skin. The meat inside was juicy. The batter was light and crispy. Also the price is reasonable.But small space.Definitely plan on being regular here !!!
"This corner restaurant in Andersonville is great - better than some of the cookie cutter places on Clark. Get a breakfast crepe with Turkish coffee or tea made with fresh mint leaves. Also, try the veggie puree soup - it's fantastic. We love this place."
My husbands parents were in town visiting during the summer and we decided to try this place. When we got there they were an hour from opening. We were about to leave when the hostess told us that they would be able to seat us. They set up a table for us outside. We were so pleased with the friendliness of the staff. Then we were presented with The Best Italian food I have ever eaten. My over all experience was beyond compare. When you go try the Cappellacci all'Aragosta. It is a Handmade pasta stuffed with lobster in a creamy pink sauce with zucchini. Heavenly!
"If you like THICK pizza, and not just breading, but CHEESE! ��This is your place.Their pizza is like a lasagna without the noodles.Two slices are very filling.The atmosphere is friendly, with a variety of Chicago types, business people and tourists... but the pizza is outstanding.This is not New York style thin and wide, but Chicago style, think and deep!By far my favorite."
"This was my first time trying Vietnamese food. I love asian food but this was different. My friend recommended I'd try Simply It for my niece's birthday party, and so i did.I ordered catering for about 50 people sometime last week. The food was incredible. It was fresh and just delicious to look at. We had ordered Spring Rolls, Dumplings, Eggrolls, Calamari Salad, and I believe it was the Papaya Salad. ��For main courses I ordered Lemongrass Chicken, Coconut Mango Beef, Sate Shrimp, Beef & Asparagus, and some Vegetarian Noodles.EVERYONE LOVED IT! I might just have to come in one of these days. I heard the place got really great ambiance and really nice staff members. My friend told me that I should try the pho. Wouldn't mind having some soup in this type of weather.Care to join me?"
"Let me just say that I have never posted a negative review about anything before, but the service @ Revolution Brewing in Logan Square was so abysmal, I was left with no choice. ��Spite is not my intent. ��Having our server reprimanded for her unacceptable behavior is. ��We had a large group (7) all of whom were drinking alcohol and eating. ��We were having a nice time. ��The food was decent, the drinks aplenty, and we intended on spending alot of time (and subsequently $$). ��We were either not hipster enough or our server simply did not like us, as she brought us our check at least 5 or 6 times. ��In fact, she came over with the check more often than she checked in to see if anyone would like to order more drinks. ��It was simply ridiculous. ��When the time finally came to pay, our party was spli"
"My husband surprise me last year at this nice place. And I have to say it was very informative spot, nice and upscale and food was awesome, great customer service, it just we seen the owner of the place he didn't come over to ask how was everything as he did everybody else. But other than that it was very nice."
"The menu is a little confusing: On one side you get really basic descriptions of dishes--Scallps, Steak,--and on the other side you get full descriptions of other dishes. I especially enjoyed the octopus with paprika, bacon-wrapped dates and arroz cangrejo. The sea bass was also excellent. Our waiter could not adequately explain the menu, but all the dishes are small and not that pricey, so order many of them. We got our first batch of dishes--goat cheese mixto, ham and fig salad, etc--within fifteen minutes of ordering. But the wild sea bass took an hour to come. Try the spiced strawberry sorbet--akin to the lime-tequila sorbet at Salpicon, it starts fruity and ends with a pleasant burst of heat. Wow!"
"I came here with my wife last Sunday to celebrate my birthday. Needless to say, the restaurant itself was good enough to make my birthday one to remember (but don't tell my wife I said that!).Everything was extraordinary. The food was perfect; much better than anything I've tried in Argyle. Argyle has always been my go-to place to get quick pho or just about any Vietnamese dish since it's a bit closer to my place, but my wife decided to treat ourselves to something different, especially since it had such great reviews. I just never knew what we were missing out on!We started our meal with the Bon Vivant Platter, which has an assortment of their 'rolls' for a variety. We both thoroughly got through that quickly due to our appetites. I love their spring rolls! Then, for appetizers, I decided"
"Went there with a Living Social coupon. ?It smelled amazing just walking by on the street.Evironment: ?Nice and clean. ?It seemed like it wanted to be nicer, but wasn't quite there. ?Very good live music.Service: ?Generally good, it was not busy, and a lot of the staff helped.Price: ?Very Expensive for the quality and amount. ?Pro's: ?Extremely good ethnic food.Con: ?They left an envelope with the bill suggesting a $5 - $10 tip for the musicians, PER guest. ?Wha?!?Con: ?The server asked us a strange question when we asked for the bill. ?She asked, Would it be alright if I add Tip & Tax to the bill before I subtract the coupon? ?For some reason, we agreed immediately. ?I assumed that she just wanted to Authorize the total amount before subtracting the coupon, and allow us (the patron) to ad"
"As a Chinese American liviing in San Francisco, I was looking for a place for a wedding reception. ��They advertise banquet room in the yellow pages and on their awning and they had decent reviews. I had my African American grand kids with me for dinner and their mother. ��I requested to talk with someone about their banquet room repeatedly. The waitress pretended not to understand English. So I used Mandarin. ��Finally they claimed they did not have a banquet room. When I used Mandarin to order she pretended not to understand me until I used English. It was strikingly odd that she had not understood my English earlier but needed my English for me to order. She scowled at us throughout the time there. ��I have never been treated so badly."
I had the fish and chips for lunch and was not impressed at all. They were OK but not great. I only say this because I had the BEST fish and chips in the city over at Big & little's (Real English Style!). When I got my espresso at the end of my meal it was absolutely gross. They need a lesson on espresso making.Ambiance was nice!
I have to say I'm really impressed with this little spot . I took a beautiful date there this past week end and we were both very impressed . Everything was super fresh and delicious . The wait staff was very attentive and respectful . I like what you they're doing there . Really great .
"I love this place and I go out my way to eat here! ��First, the owner is so welcoming and gracious. ��If I'm waiting for carryout he brings a cup of tea right away, if there isn't a table right away, he brings tea and sometimes even little complimentary appetizers. ��Second, the food is great. ��The Pho is really authentic and delicious! I also love their mango coconut beef - they actually prepare and serve it in a coconut - the flavors are just wonderful and the beef is super tender. ��The lemongrass chicken, papaya salad, the saigonese crepe are all stand outs too. ��Plus, the prices are really reasonable AND it's BYOB! I just wish that they delivered to my River West neighborhood!"
"This place is great. ��The Website is terrible. ��Will someone with some web experience please give them a hand. ��Anyway, the food was great. ��I got a Pesto Gnocchi, and it was really good. ��I kind of wish that we got a light salad or something ahead of time. ��Other than that everything was awesome. ��This is a great BYOB."
"I ate at Sunda this past Saturday night and would never eat there again. The service was awful, the food was overpriced and unedible. The only good thing was it has a nice ambiance and reasonable drinks. I would suggest if you want to go there to skip dinner and just have a couple drinks at the bar."
"I love this place and the best part is that its walking distance from home! The staff is super friendly and as I had not had tons of sushi lately the server gave me tons of great recommendations. She was fantastic! I really feel bad for not remembering her name, I love to give props to specific people who are awesome. The prices here are great and the selection is a lot begger than I thought it would be. This is going to be a staple of my diet from now on."
"Really bad service! Our waiter was condescending and extremely awkward. ��Will probably not return just based on the service (that's how bad he was). �� My cousin loved her meal (lamb) and my truffle quiche was just so-so. ��The Lithuanian bacon biscuits were interesting, I like the taste but the texture of the biscuit was a little off. ��Loved the decor!"
"My girlfriend I ventured to this Lincoln Park establishment last night based on reviews from fellow yelpers. ��Upon arriving, I immediately knew I would enjoy sitting in this place and having a cold beer because of the lively atmosphere. ��However, I didn't know if I would enjoy eating their pie. ��I am always skeptical of pizza places that claim to be better than Gino's East or Lou's.We started off with the Combo appetizer which includes cheese sticks, fried mushroom caps, fried zucchini, and poppers. ��All of this for 9 bucks definitely worth the money. ��Then had the house salad which included carrots, olives, tomatoes, and chopped romaine. ��Also, a pretty good deal at 4 bucks a salad. ��Now for the main course, we ordered the large pizza in hopes we would enjoy it enough to last through the "
"Amazing. ��The wings are great, the sauces are better. ��Alden who works there is cool. ��Burritos and bowls are also pretty damn good."
"Of course the prices are as high as can be, but TOTALLY WORTH IT! Amazing food and meat is absolutely gourmet and their specialty. And talk about service! The serves walk around constantly with new food for you to try, we really felt like kings eating! The cheese bread is the best. They keep refilling it. I have no complaints. I understand the price is high, but this isn't any everyday restaurant. You get what oyu pay for and it's excellent food."
"Delicious, delicious, delicious. ��You smell a little bit like your food at the end of the night, but it is worth the Dry Cleaning bill!"
"As a first time diner I am sold on India House! I choose the buffet because I am unfamiliar with Indian cuisine. ��$14 dollars introduced me to over 10 dishes and that is not including the delicious desserts and salad bar that is part of the buffet. ��AMAZING tandoori chicken came out with flat bread as part of the meal (which was my favorite part of the meal!!!) ��Service was top notch. ��The hostess was beautiful and smiled the whole time, the server was very informative and even the bussers were attentive to answering questions. ��(I was eying a dipping sauce at the salad bar and he informed me of what were the two most popular, told be about each one, and explained that I should try them out with the appetizers offered at the front of the buffet.) ��I am planning to dine here once a month, w"
This restaurant is simply great. ��We started with the Northern Vietnam Fisherman's Soup (Bun Rieu) which was fabulous with a light slightly sweet basic flavor enhanced with cilantro and various spices. ��The server provided the spices on the side so we could add them to taste. ��We chose two vegetable entries. ��I had the Vegetarian's Delite (Nam Xao Rau) and my friend had the Asian Vegetables on Crispy Noodles (Mi Xao Don). ��Both were excellent with fresh vegetables cooked perfectly. ��While this is a very busy and somewhat noisy restaurant the food and service is superb. I am already looking forward to my next visit and ��trying something else from the many items on the menu. Another visit and the place is even better!
"I always thought the best Vietnamese food was when my mom, dad or grandparents would cook dinner...Sorry family! Tank Noodle has won my heart and stomach. I have tried so many items off their menu and this is truly the only place you want to eat Vietnamese food at. ��I'm from Southern California where there is a large Viet population and a Viet neighborhood (Aka Little Saigon). ��Who would have thought that I would have to come to Chicago to find best Viet restaurant?"
"Yesterday,my three friends and I had a late lunch at Irazu. Although the food was fine the service was miserable. Upon leaving the restaurant, my dear friend spoke frankly with the waiter and told him that the service was poor. ?He became defensive and a bit loud. ?He said, ?No one has ever complained about my service in the six years that I've been working here. ?Finally, he apologized. I don't know the waiter's name because he wasn't wearing a name tag, nor did he introduce himself. ?The poor service was all we talked about on the way home. ?I'm sure none of us will be returning to Irazu anytime soon. And that's fine because I can make my own delicious oatmeal and pinolillo shakes at home!"
"They don't give me the option to give 0 stars. The service was absolutely horrific, let alone the chicken wings. I went after reading the spelndid reviews with my significant other and boy was I WRONG.Korean Chicken? I think NOT! If you want decent chicken go to Popeyes or KFC. Overpriced with awful sauces mixed in. Our table was filthy with trash left from other customers. The staff was also playing hardcore rock music.... In a so called Korean RESTAURANT. DO NOT COME TO CRISP. It's a sham all of you who have reviewed this with 5 stars are idiots and need new taste buds.ENJOY!"
"Great food and good service. It's BYOB, so bring a bottle of wine with friends and have them create Sangria. I love the Goat Cheese Empanadas & any entree that I've tried."
Although I woun't come here for authentic Greek Food (Sorry Athena's would be first - besides it's a Bakery and Cafe) - I will admit that I usually skip on all deserts to come here.If you have a chance to try their Loukoumathes aka Honey balls or Honey Puffs are amazing.
"I will say the food was delicious. The problem I have is,I got food catered from them ��and all went well with the food: and I understand that my mother went ahead and complicated it a little bit, ��but the manager was told that my mother would be the one to pick up and pay the rest of the amount due. They went ahead and ran my credit card first with out my consent ,and why they still had my credit card # is beyond me. My mom ended up paying with cash. When I checked my statement I seen that I was charged. I called to let them know what happened and the manager explained that she ran the card through and that my mother told her after the fact that she was going to pay, but in the manner that she was explaining this to me she was being real short ��almost snotty. which upsets me cause I didn't"
"I remember the menu being fairly lengthy but I was there for the spicy beef stew noodle soup .So I didn't spend much time perusing. ��My, what a bowl of noodle soup (my picture of it might make you drool) - nearly perfect (I wish it were spicier though).The beef is in big, tender chunks. ��And it's not just meat but the tendon (which Chinese people tend to love) - amazing amounts of tendon. ��The five spice broth is deep, clear, and beefy. ��The noodles are not hand-pulled but they're thick and soft. ��They add spinach and a bit of chopped, pickled mustard greens. ��Liberal amounts of white pepper round out the dish. ��It's served piping hot and is very filling.Awesome!"
"I'd been reading about this joint for years and had never gone in. The location is a touch out of the way and the bar is, while inviting, not all that interesting visually. The typical old posters of Belgian greats and a wall of bottles that shows off their impressive list. I had a Van Honsebrouk Gueze Fond Tradition that was superb. A tart, refreshing mix of 30% wheat and 70% barley that was spot on and, according to the beer list, a Hopleaf exclusive. The beer prices here run about the norm in Chicago, which is, sadly, way over-priced. The only real issue I had was that, while I had heard rave reviews of the food menu here, I found it to be just adequate. The house specialty Belgian-style mussels were good and the frites and aioli that came with were great (is aioli every anything but aw"
"If You find yourself in Lakeview then you have to try Crisp! Every single time I've been there which has been many my food is always hot fresh and tasty. The buddha bowls are to die for, packed with veggies and meat topped off with a fresh egg. The sauces are very Flavorful . ��The bibimbap is fantastic your sure to be a fan !Be sure to grab a seat before you order they get sat up fast!"
"I visited Hopleaf a few days ago to meet a friend for dinner. ��The wait was over an hour long, which was ok, not ideal. ��They had a good beer selection in the bar area, then we found our way upstairs to wait for our table. ��The environment and decor made the experience worth it, but I most likely would not return. ��After being seated, we decided we both wanted to order the brisket. ��There were 2 options, a brisket sandwich and a brisket meal. ��The meal was just the beef with a side of their mac n cheese. ��The sandwich however came with fries. ��Well, in fears that the brisket wouldn't be good alone, I asked if I could order than sandwich with the mac n cheese.. and id idn't mind paying the difference. ��Nope, I had to order the mac n cheese separate, brinign my brisket sandwich meal to over "
"My girlfriends and I headed to this restaurant by chance and couldn't have picked a better place to celebrate a girls' night out. ��We all chose to forgo the meat and stuck with the harvest menu which was delicious and plenty to eat. ��There were plenty of choices and the sauces were amazing. ��Our waiter and hosts/hostesses treated us like princesses. ��They were so attentive and upon hearing that one guest in our party was a vegetarian, they sent the chef out to walk her through the harvest area and show her what foods were made with chicken or fish products. ��We had so much fun that we ended up staying around for drinks afterwards. ��Great night!"
"I ate here recently and was pleasantly surprised! ��The atmosphere was great, almost familial. ��Our waiter was very willing to answer our questions and even gave us some recommendations that were great. ��I'll be back for sure."
"Consistently solid and affordable. ��You get a ton of food for the price and it's always good. ��Never had a bad meal there.Not quite 5 stars, but a solid option when you need your Mediterranean fix."
"I haven't been to Chicago in years, and so it was great to be able to dine on a thin-crust pizza a la Sally's of New Haven, CT. ��It brought back many old memories of great times. ��The pizza was piping hot and spectacular. ��Wish I could bring a pie home with me to San Francisco. ��And, of course, what goes better with pizza than a nice cold beer - the IPA from their micro-brewery was the perfect thirst quencher. ��Finally, the service was top-shelf. ��The servers enjoy what they do and the owner/founder, Billy Jacobs, after 11 years ��with the business, was still greeting customers and asking them how things were. ��Everything at this establishment was just first-rate."
"Chicago is known for their steakhouses, but there is a new big bog in town! ��Mastro's is doing everything right, from the food to service to ambiance! ��I honestly didn't have one complaint about the experience. ��The steaks were amazing and all the sides and dessert were just as good. ��I went for the NY Strip which was cooked to perfection. ��Dessert was creme b. and the yummy whip cream they serve it with. ��This is my new fav. steakhouse in chicago!"
"this is my go to brunch place. ��consistently good food. busy times will warrant a wait, so be prepared. ��i don't mind the outdoor line, as the food makes up for it."
"Great spot. The roast duck was excellent as were the scallops. Twice in about 5 minutes, the food delivery guy came by my table with a meal I didn't order. It was a fast floor so I assumed he just messed up the table number or something. However, for that my glass of wine was on the house. Unrequested (and unnecessary really) but a nice touch on their part. And the cappuccino I had to close the meal was really terrific. One thing though; don't be put off by the lack of a dress code. This is the sort of place where tuxedos dine along side sleeveless t-shirts."
one word... AMAZING!!!
"I'll never forget my first Gino's East Pizza, not just because it happened to be our main course at a huge swinging Bachelor party. ��Wow, what a night, but the pizza is my clearest memory. ��That deep, delicious crust, topped with loads of cheese, sauce, onion, mushroom, and more cheese. ��The ultimate topping was a complete solid layer of sausage. ��It was the infamous patty topped deep dish cheese sausage mushroom onion. ��Even with the myriad of tantalizing treats around - all I could think of was that pizza. ��So began a marriage of man and pizza. ��Like many things in life, Gino's East must be experienced."
"Being vegan, I hate to write a bad review about a veg restaurant. However, the service is horrible, with a bad attitude (although I hear that the food is very good).I placed a pick-up order at 9:30pm, expecting that it would take me about 30 mins to drive there (according to Google Maps). I arrived at about 10:15pm, and the woman at the door told me that they close at 10pm (their website says 10:30pm), and that they may have thrown out my order.I spoke with someone else, who said they didn't know about the order. A third person tried to help, and asked me what I had ordered, which was the wings and a Reuben sandwich. He informed me that they had run out of wings hours ago, and implied that I didn't actually call and place the order. I was pretty pissed with his attitude.So I never actually"
"I had heard great things about Sunda and read the raving reviews about it. I planned my birthday dinner here for me and three of my friends. When we got there, we had ordered an appetizer which took over a half an hour to come. Then, we all decide to order sushi. The sushi was absolutely sub-par. It wasn't good, and there weren't a lot of options. My friend said hers was so bad that it has ruined sushi for her for a month. On top of all that - all of our sushi came out at different times. My other friend, ordered a soup, which never even came at all. Our server was unapologetic, and didn't even recognize the fact that he had forgotten the soup and still wanted to charge us for it. Then the bill came... We had to separate the checks ourselves, which we did; and we wrote all of the totals/se"
"To say that the service was horrible the last 3 times we have been to Calo would be an understatement. ��The wait staff is incredibly unattentive. ��Our waitress (Daisy) greeted us after about 5 minutes and took our drink orders. I was optimistic that we wouldnt have a repeat of our last experience where we waited so long for the waitress to come by with refills, that I finally went and retrieved them myself from the bar. ��That was several months prior and we had hoped the service had improved. Unfortunately that was not the case. Once she had taken our entree order, we didnt see or hear from her until we asked (one of the other wait staff mind you) for our bill. Only then did she ask how everything was. If your looking for good Italian AND a responsive wait staff, I would skip Calo and take"
"yes! yes! yes! ��we ordered 2 orders of the kalbi, this way, we can grill it ourselves in the middle of the table, that stuff is way good. ��i have had a lot of korean bbq but the kalbi here when you can grill it yourself is absolutely killer. ��all the little dishes they give you with it are adventurous, if you are afraid to eat authentic korean, it may not be for you, but i love it!!"
"The restaurant is nice. ��The bacon and cheddar hush puppies were yummy, but a lot heavier than I expected. ��I was so disappointed with the brisket sandwich! ��I've only had brisket once before - in Texas. ��It was so good that I was hoping someone in the city could make brisket just as good. ��It wasn't Chicago q. ��It tasted like it had no seasoning. ��It appeared as if it would be moist since something wet drenched my sandwich bun to the point I couldn't pick it up or eat it, but it was dry as well as flavorless. ��Bummer. ��:("
"HAIR IN SUSHI ROLL! ANT IN DRINK!My husband and I have been loyal patrons of Wakamono since 2007 when we moved to the Lakeview neighborhood. Last night we took my sister and her fianc�� there for dinner. Our table ordered 2 Godzilla rolls, 1 hotel California roll, 1 maki Mexicano roll and 1 of the daily special rolls. When the rolls were served they were plated all together. The second piece of sushi I ate was a from the Godzilla roll. After placing on my place, I noticed a black human hair sticking directly out of the center of the sushi. After seeing this, me and the rest of my party lost their appetites. I pointed this hair out to our server (SONIA) and asked to talk to the manager. I explained to the manager (a female, who refused to provide her name) that we were dissatisfied with the "
"I would not go back. the service was atrocious. We were seated at 5 pm, our first cocktail did not come until 530, dessert came at 645. The waitress was so bad, she did not even realize she was bad. the management was oblivious to the service problems and spent most of the time drinking at the bar or standing at the host station, clogging up the area where the wait staff was attempting to enter food orders."
"I know lot's of people have strong opinions about this place. I just wanted to add a few things.Great stuff. I always try to get their very early and found this adds to my experience. I am not a fan of waiting Try going on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Additionally, Doug is a personable independent owner operator and I am pleased to support his fine joint!"
This place is outrageous!!! I went for drinks with some girls on a Thursday night. There was a line to get in at 6pm on a Thursday! What made it more frustrating was people kept coming downstairs to check on their friends and said the place was practically empty and therefore lame. Get over yourself! Don't make people stand in line in 90 degree heat at 6pm on Thursday to create the illusion that your bar is packed. To top it off the bouncer is a hot headed russian guy who flipped out on a girl who made 1 comment about how stupid it was that he only let 2 people enter in over 30 minutes. Fire that asshole! You lost 5 customers and received bad reviews. ��If you like to be treated like shit ��while standing outside a bar at 6pm on a Thursday then this is the place to go. I left ��and went to a 
"OK, so after reading reviews here and checking out the website we went to Geja's for a romantic date night. It was a total disaster. From the waiter who was ignoring and just trying to get this over with, to the super narrow space where tables are squeezed into one another...it was a real disappointment. We were seated next to a table of ?four, and we were so close that literally we could hear every word, even if they were to whisper... No romantic atmosphere whatsoever...The only nice impression I got was from the live guitar music being played and the bus boy, who was really attentive. The waiter took about 25 minutes to show up to check on us after getting the food and finally ask me if I want another glass of wine!!! I am sorry, but if you are paying $120 + for a dinner for two, you do"
"So I decided to order online, because they were offering free garlic knots! So I order my large pizza- with tomato, garlic, and mushrooms. ��I was not able to choose mushrooms on the choice of ingredients cus either it was not there or I couldnt find it. ��They have all of their ingredients in alphabetical order, but its hard to find the things. ��For example, I was looking for tomatos but it took me ��A LONG time to realize it was under F, for ""Fresh Sliced Roma Tomatos"". ��All of that description is not necessary. ��So because I couldn't find mushrooms, I wrote it in the description and assumed they would either charge me extra or at least add the mushrooms, but instead they just disreguarded them. ��Next comes delivery. ��I placed my order at about 5:50. ��Estimated delivery time was 7:00 which "
"If you want to feel like you're dining in an Ikea showroom, this is your place. The food isn't bad, but it's certainly nothing special. I suppose they have a good wine selection - and so what? The service, like most trendy restaurants in Chicago, sucks. On the other hand, plenty of people seem to like it, so..."
"5 stars for their pan pizza. ��Seriously, it's that good (to me). ��I don't eat pizza often, but when I want to treat myself, I order the pan pizza from Calo. ��Plus, their service is usually awesome - definitely keeps me coming back! ��(or, truth be told, ordering from Grub Hub). ��Either way, I'm sold."
"The customer service is terrible! It's like it's what they're going for they're so good at being bad it! If that makes sense. My sister and I went in there to get food for the movies, their fries (which was supposed to come with a truffle aioli, delicious sounding) and I got their hot dog. Neither had ANY condiments when we got to the theater. Those are 2 foods that require them! The girl that took my order had a disgruntled, I-don't care-nor-like-this-job attitude that seemed perpetuated by the nonchalant manager who kept walking off while a long line of customers meandered around. ��Then, after the movie, my sister wanted to go back in to get some snacks for her and her man. OK, I could go for some cheese myself. We're checking out and having a very pleasant chit-chat with the ��cashier. S"
"DO NOT WASTE MONEY AT THIS RESTAURANT!!! I forgot where I was for a moment at this small neighbourhood restaurant. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!! We had heard great things about the food at this restaurant. My friend made a reservation a week before, and she also called to confirm our reservation before we arrived. It was for a party of seven people for my birthday dinner at 6:30pm on Saturday night. Myself and a friend arrived at 6:30pm (our reservation time) to get our table but they do not seat incomplete parties.The short man who was helping us needed an ETA, which we gave of 10-15 minutes. The cubs were getting out, traffic was really bad, and life happens. He told us this was not good enough and asked us, You would'nt be late for a job interview would you? WHAT!!!!???? I told hi"
"One of my favorite Chicago spots. The drink list has breadth and depth. Local vendors and growers are used and promoted. The menu is diverse and changes with the season. If it's listed, I recommend the pumpkin ravioli- yummm. The atmosphere is great- relaxed during the week and bustling on the weekend. The cozy, warm feel (as well as the sweet potato fries) make for one the best meal experiences in Chicago. A word to the wise, be prepared to spend at least $15, not including an alcoholic drink, which could be as much as $12. However, if you've got a little extra change in your pocket, this place is highly recommended!"
Went here for a friend's birthday. All I can say is wow. Fine dining and entertainment in the presentation. I love this place. Even better when someone else is paying.
I had dinner with a bunch a friends here a few months back and it was very enjoyable. The dessert was AMAZING we all had a great time and all of us thought our food tasted great! ��We actually are going to plan a date for us all to go back! Good job Grand Lux Cafe!
"While the food is delicious, I found the overall experience unpleasant. After reading on the restaurant's website that reservations were not advised, I decided to arrive without them about 45-minutes prior to dinner service. We were told the wait would be 2 to 2.5-hours. The restaurant was completely empty aside from the bar and waiting area being so packed one could not move through to get to the bathrooms. After walking around the city for 1.5-hours, we were so cold we decided to wait in the crowded waiting area (a few chairs, three I think, next to the entrance and in front of the hostess's desk). There was no room in the bar. After 2.5-hours exactly (the hostess holds you to her original estimate), we were seated. Two of us ordered two entrees and three appetizers. Portions are very sm"
So it was a Sunday morning and i should know better but I couldnt help myself I just love this place. ��Jam packed with about a 30 min wait but still worth it. ��Sat at the counter and had an awesome server named Victoria. ��Made us laugh and gave great service. ��No Bongo room for us. Good stuff.
"Hands down one of my favorite places in the city! The food is beyond amazing and the atmosphere is great. Not to mention the $4 house wine is delicious. Things to try: Blue cheese fondue, balsamic bread, the mussels (the juice is phenom), and the pot roast. But you can't, I repeat CAN'T, miss out on their carrot cake. The best I have ever had!"
Sushi was good for the price . Everything i ordered was fresh and tasted good.
"I have been to the restaurant several times and it was all good experience. However, I did not enjoy it at all tonight. We had an appetizer and it was not hot. We communicated that to the waiter. Not only the waiter did not apologize but told us that he took the dish out right after it's cooked. Without saying another word, he took the plate and left. The waiter did not handle the customer feedback well and showed us his attitude. It was a really bad experience and ruined the night."
"I live about 10 minutes away from the Bad Apple and I am hooked!!! I love the beer selection (I miss the Dragons Milk, I was addicted) and the drinks are great too (Pickled Pixie Punch and The Lime in the Coconut are my favorites!). The food is also GREAT! Fried cheese curds- need I say more...but I will, ��the burger topped with the pork and onion rings is fantastic- I don't know what that guy who complained about the pulled pork is talking about, he must be lacking taste buds- ��also the fries are incredible and the PBJ is awesome!!! Ooo and that appetizer- the fries topped with cheese curds and gravy is insanely good!!! I will definitely be frequenting this spot!!!"
Festive. Good food. I went for new years and the portions were very small for the price.
"Seriously outstanding. Last week, my colleague and I went to Chicago on business, stayed at the Holiday Inn and looked for places to eat. The concierge suggested the Kinzie Chop House so we duly went there.....and WOW... the food was incredible! We were served by possibly the most competent, polite, professional and friendly (without being annoying) waiter we have ever experienced. His name was Frank. The guy is beyond good....literally at the top of his game. We went back a second time and ordered different dishes just to see if they were just as good - and of yes.. they were....the place is brilliant. You MUST go there. Ask for Frank. You won't be let down. 5 MASSIVE STARS."
"This place is a joke, such a disappointment. ��Way over priced, don't think there was more than 1 bottle of wine under $100. ��Tasting menu should be called the tasting foam menu. ��I would never go back even if they offered me a free meal."
"Noisy, noisy, noisy, this trendy restaurant is a great place to meet friends, just don't expect to hear what they have to say. Not a great place for a first date either IMO if you want to get to know each other. The decor was very warm and cozy. The non-traditional oxtail potstickers was a first for me and pretty good. The Loompya was crispy but bland and a little on the dry side even with the dipping sauces. ��The Kobe beef tartare was very tasty. My wife had the braised pork belly and I had the braised short ribs, both good but we both agreed it could have been more tender."
"Personally, Pizza is one of my favorite things to eat. I absolutely love it! I came here thinking that their pizza had so many great reviews, i thought it would totally be worth it.No other restaurant I have went to has ever made me so sick in my life. I definitely will not be coming back here anytime soon!"
"I was underwhelmed. For all the rave reviews this place gets, I was disappointed w what I found to be just mediocre Italian food. ��The owners/chefs are from Mia Francesca group and I really wish we'd have gone there (even though I've been a dozen times) instead. The only two things that really stood out were the bruschetta and the black pepper and cheese spaghetti. I don't like mushrooms so I was hesitant about the bruschetta. But I gave it a shot anyway and I might just be a mushroom convert now. Sooo good. The Pepe e Cacio spaghetti was amazing. There was not enough of it for two people, though, as promised by our server. (Or maybe we just wanted more because it was the only main dish with any true flavor?) The salad was good, light. Had apples sliced very thin to add some much needed ta"
"Simply It is the perfect neighborhood restaurant. Mr Nguyen and his family will make you feel welcome. The food is always delicious and healthy. If you're into carry out, they do a great job packing and orders are always ready quickly. And it's rare that I don't walk out with more than I ordered -- some special treat that Mr Nguyen has eagerly added to my bag. Definitely stop in for a bubble tea or tapioca fruit smoothie on a warm summer day or a hot bowl of chicken soup or pho in the winter. And don't forget bahn mi for any lunch.My wife and I have been living around the corner for a few years and this is our go to spot for a delicious healthy meal. Definitely give it a try and support this great neighborhood establishment. And if you're really lucky, you'll visit shortly after Mr Nguyen'"
I ordered for delivery 2 nightz ago. the food waz fire.you gotta try the watermelon smoothie. that waz fire too. the food waz still hot and Itz cheap. and they delivery far. i'll come in to eat one of these dayz.
"Newly opened place off to a great start!Just stopped in for Brunch with my sweetie. ��She had the Marscarpone filled French Toast, which was excellent. ��A suggestion would be to tone down the gratuitous dollops of Marscarpone on either side of the plate. ��They're fine and tasty, but really not needed, and just add to the cost of preparing the dish without adding any interest. ��I had the Nanadict, their take on Eggs Bennedict. ��Very well (as in good) done eggs and just the right balance of flavours. ��The homefries were quite good as well. ��A side of scrambled eggs that we shared was very basic. ��Nothing bad about them, but nothing special. ��They could have used a little bit of salt. ��Service was very attentive and friendly, though some of the staff seemed almost shy, which was kind of sweet."
"For the price I paid, the food should have tasted better. Just average"
"This is my favorite Korean Restaurant in Chicago Area. Their side dishes are the best, as there are so many that comes with entrees.Their food is absolutely delicious.I just wish when I order more than 2 BBQ's, I won't have to cook them at the table."
some of the best Mediterranean food i've ever tasted. the different selections of hummus are superb and the swordfish skewer is a must-try. ��great food that will fill you up and it's healthy!
"Might get pricey, but it's my to go place with my out of town friends and family. Location, Location, Location!"
"Let me preface this by saying that I am a faux-foodie, this means 1) ��my palette is not refined (my ideal meal consists of anything with guacamole, cheese and sour cream 2) I'm frugal when it comes to food (I'd rather buy a new pair of shoes) and 3) everything I've learned about food I have learned from watching Bravo. ��It was by watching ""Top Chef-Masters,"" that I heard of Graham Elliot and his restaurant in Chicago. ��Two ��friends and I decided to check it out and what a great experience it turned out to be. ��The ambiance is very causal and welcoming. �� I tired a Blueberry hill drink(gin, cr��me de violette, blueberry compote and basil shrub) to kick off the evening and it was tasty and went down very easily (don't be afraid of the notion of basil shrub in your drink). �� White tuna sashimi"
One of my top five picks in Chicago! ��Has to be among the top five best fondue restaurants in North America. ��Incredible! ��Expensive but worth every penny.
"After hearing such raving and wonderful reviews about this place, I decided to finally go try it out last night. I had such high hopes when I walked into the place but left feeling a bit let down. First off, although the staff was cordial, I got the feeling I was literally being ""rushed"" out of the place. This could be attributed to the fact that I arrived about half an hour before closing; however, if they took me in as a customer and were going to take my money, they should treat me like any other customer. I ordered the recommended Tiger Cry beef for appetitizer and was disappointed. Although the menu said the beef was char-grilled, what I got was mostly burned, inedible pieces of beef that were bitter to the taste, spare a few pieces towards the middle of the pile. Next, came the potst"
I've been going here for years and have enjoyed their food! we especially love their homemade tortilla chips that they serve you before you get your meal with their great salsa. each time I try to order something different and I'm not disappointed. Their margaritas are not that great. Seem as though they need more alcohol. LOL but that's just me.
"Average food and the waiter, when we could find him, continued to try to sell high-priced items at every turn. Pacing of the arrival of the food was sporadic and not timed to arrival of cocktails. Cold in the restaurant; one friend had to wear her coat. When we asked for more of the bread that is first put on the table, we were charged an additional $1.50. Would not go back."
"We had a lot of expectations for this place, but unfortunately it didn't deliver. Not sure what happened, but when the whole table (7 people) ordered their burgers medium-rare, we all received well-done burgers, which was quite disappointing. The toppings were good, and since it was a holiday weekend, we relayed this to the waitress but offered to stick with out meals. She said she would talk to the kitchen and check what she wrote down, but never gave us any follow-up.Our experience aside, the burgers are well-thought out and the beer list is not bad (there's a lot of beer competition in the neighborhood, so adding some more exciting local taps like Three Floyds, Half Acre, Two Brothers, etc would really help).Though the Ukrainian Village has a lot of great places to eat, Lockdown is a we"
"We love the Bad Apple & have gone several times since moving to the neighborhood. They have a great selection of interesting burgers, the beef is grass fed, and the beer list is awesome. My favorite burgers are the Slow Burn, the Frenchie and the Edmund Fitzgerald. We almost always come with our three-year-old & they are always very accommodating."
I stood outside for over an hour through a thunderstorm...Was it worth it? Yes! Duck Fat Fries were awesome! Must try one of the specials! I had the Gyro dog...Delicious!
"My friend had her birthday dinner here and it was AMAZING! ��I am a vegetarian (almost vegan) and there were so many great choices. ��I got the Satay Tofu, which was spicy and very flavorful. ��They also are BYOB and there is no corkage fee, double bonus!"
beststeakevergood sauce too
"Wow, I've never been to a restaurant like this before. Everything was incredibly creative and delicious. Never knew what to expect next. Servers were perfect. Just great."
This is spectacular food and very fun ambiance. ��Not only do they play interesting newer music including underground hip hop but the staff is great. ��The chef's brought out each and every dish to us and explained each dish thoroughly. ��My girl and I even grabbed a drink with them when they closed at a nearby watering hole.
"Good main fish dishes, rude service, BAD catfish sandwich. ��My girlfriend took me to Glenn's Diner for a nice dinner tonight. ��The hostess was very nice and even on a Friday night we got a table without waiting long and not reservation. ��We ordered the arctic char special and a catfish po'boy and split the two. ��The char was spectacular! ��The po'boy was good, great sauce, but then I bit a piece that was obviously uncooked or a bad part of the fish (rubbery, unchewable, blech). ��When I called our waitress over she took it back to the kitchen. ��When she came back she said that it was fine and the catfish maybe just wasn't the fish for me. ��Nonsense! ��I've had catfish dozens of times, even cooked it myself! ��This was a bad bit of fish. ��And I know that because I'm writing this in between trip"
"Wow this is a good restaurant! On the recommendation of a friend and having passed this place many time the wife and I mosied on to here. I started with the oatmeal shake w/ soy milk and this was awesome!! Very tasty as I shared with the wife. She got Ice tea and I normally don't like ti but thought it was good actually. I got the vegetarian sandwich which was full of flavor and portioned well for a meal, not to much but just enough. The wife got a steak that was real thin and she said it was great. We both got the rice and beans which were really good. Flavored with a little bit of lime. Yum! Outdoor seating was a plus but it was a little crowded. Not really a big deal seeing as how everywhere here is like that. Service was friendly and good, they take cash only but have a ATM inside whic"
Food was amazing!! Staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a great night.
I ��have been to Tank a couple of times now and each time the food has been wonderful. ��The only downfall to this place is that each time I asked for no MSG and I am pretty sure they didn't listen...massive headache inducer for me and I was out for 2 days after the fact ��I can't say that any food is worth a headache BUT I will say it is very tasty.
"We went here for brunch on a Saturday and only waited about 30 minutes for a spot at the bar. I had an extremely hard time deciding what to order, because the everything looked and sounded delicious. I had the rock shrimp benedict and it was honestly one of the best meals of my life. My boyfriend didn't enjoy his chicken/spinach/eggs as much. Coffee and lattes are great and I would definitely go back."
"I had never been to Chicago and I was recommended by a friend that lived near downtown that the only place for fine dinning and great steak was at Kinzie. And that recommendation lived up to its word and then some. The food was out of this world, the wait staff went out of their way to accommodate any need we had, and the visit by the manager after the meal was dying down made it an evening and dinner that cant be matched anywhere else. Just a great place to enjoy great food and a great atmosphere."
"Great food, very affordable. I ordered $7 chorizo burrito and it was HUGE. Made a great lunch the next day. Their guacamole was pretty good but their salsa was delicious. Very prompt about bringing refills on chips, salsa, and water."
"very warm place, good food great service, love their apps, tortas and burritos! PLUS , accidentally left my debit card there and when I called, the manager assured me it was locked up and safe! ��Really expected, in these times, to hear, ""nope, we don't have it""."
"I have been here several times and I have never had anything but a great experience. Yes, at times it is packed, but that is because it is a great place with great food and not only a HUGE selection of beer, but a ton of great beers. Every time I go I will order one or two of my usual and then I randomly pick 2 new ones from the beer menu. Now of course you aren't going to like every beer that you order if you do it that way because there are so many different types that you are bound to get a kind of beer that you aren't fond of. ��If you aren't feeling as adventurous just as one of the bartenders, who are extremely knowledgeable and are great at steering you in the right direction.The only part of me that wants to give this place anything less than 5 starts is the part that doesn't want a"
"I really enjoy hanging out at this place after work. ��I absolutley adore the way it's decorated, it feels like an old library/old frat house. ��The service is always great and they have a nice variety of foods, my personal favorite is the burger, which is generously portioned and always cooked to perfection.This place is casual and fun and I highly recommend it if you are in the area."
This is one of my favorite restaurant in my neighborhood. Love the atmosphere and food. We had not the best drinks last time we were there but I just cannot love the food enough. We willbe back :)
"I arranged for a corporate dinner at Piccolo Sogno and everyone was just delighted with the restaurant. ��They gave high praise for the service, food & atmosphere (they were seated outside). �� I will definitely be sending more groups there in the future."
"I ate here once about four years ago and remembered being very full and happy, so my fiance and I ate here again last weekend. ?They must have been terribly understaffed, because waiting was pretty much how we spent most of our time. ?Good thing we're in love. ?We were quoted a 30-minute wait time, which we were OK with; we went for a walk and got a bottle of wine. ?When we got back we were told another 20 minutes, and by the time we actually sat down it had been a total of 60 minutes. ?First rule of hostessing - overquote your wait time, never underquote. ?People get impatient. ?I've worked in restaurants, so I hate to be one of those people that tries to do the hostesses job, but it's frustrating to wait an hour when there are four empty tables in plain sight. ?The server was friendly bu"
"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! ��The food, service and value never cease to amaze me. ��If you haven't tried this place, you must! ��The lunch special is the best deal in town. ��The beef Banh Mi is out of this world. ��There's always something extra special added -- for instance, I just went in to pick up a simple (but delicious!!) chicken salad for my lunch and got back to work to find a generous container of complimentary fresh fruit in my bag. ��Awesome."
"An amazing dining experience. We went to celebrate a milestone in a friend's career. We had the seasonal collection. My friend's wife is vegan. She called in advance and the kitchen made all of her food vegan. Service was excellent. At one point, my friend's wife was cold. One of our attendants noticed and came over with a selection of shawls that matched her dress. Also loved the chair for my purse."
"Fresh susih, but small pieces. Delivery time as promised. ��Prefer Matsuya"
I have been coming here for years and it is always as good as the first time. The dogs are plump and tasty (they use their own recipe) and the fries are the best. The Superonionchips and the Superveggies are really good too.
They always forget something. Three times they have forgotten miso soup of wasabi or something else. I do not want to be bothered by delivery people twice in one night to get what I ordered! The delivery person also forgot the receipt so I added two dollars for delivery charge. Never again. Hama Matsu here I come.
"Arrive on time for our reservation & told by hostess ""your table's not ready, just go wait in the bar."" ��She actually uses her hand to wave us away. Ok....so we spend the next 15 minutes trying to get a bartender's attention, but they all seem to be huddled in a corner discussing something very important. ��Finally convince a cocktail waitress to get us drinks, and when I say ""convince"" I mean that she seems very reluctant to serve us for some reason....strange approach to customer service. ��Finally get drinks a good 10 minutes later and then spend the next half hour amusing ourselves by watching the endless parade of fashion victims, dudes with too much product in their hair, and sugar daddies entertaining their bored ""dates."" ��After noticing that plenty of parties have been sat while we l"
Will never eat at 90 miles again. I know about Cuban food and trust me this isn't it. It taste like a Mexican attempt at Cuban food. Worst experience of my life. overpriced food and its smells like hot trash. Thank you but no thanks
"Myself and 2 business associates had dinner a few nights ago. ��We sat in the bar because we didn't have a reservation. ��The service was terrible. ��It took 15 minutes to serve our drinks. ��I even made the comment I would help them smash the grapes. ��The service did not get better throughout the night. ��We saw our waiter three times the entire night. ��I ordered blue crab stuffed lobster. ��I couldn't stick my fork in the lobster it was so overcooked. ��They probably had a bad night, but when you want to charge top shelf prices, they should give top shelf service and food."
"t's the Olive Garden of Greek food. ��The kitchy interior, the overly-oily food, the inflated prices, the servers who refill your water glass after every time you drink a sip.Not veg friendly- the dolmades (grape leaves) and the stuffed peppers and tomatoes all have meat in them. ��The vegetable plate ��presents an assortment of delicious things entirely doused in oil and fat and overcooked till they're slippery and gooey."
"My wife and I went here for our anniversary recently and we found it to be charming.The service was excellent, the crepes were delicious and beautifully presented, and we had a great time."
"Theme restaurants can go wrong like the worn out TGI Friday's/Applebee's/Chili's chain. But ya know what, themes themselves are not to blame. The over-production of some chains are to blame. Nearly any Irish bar in Chicago isn't really an Irish bar. It's just a theme. So when you see a place go out and make a statement with a theme its a risk. Some people hate it but others like me like the ambience.What I look for is to have a place set it apart from the usual crowd. Sure this is a burgers and beer joint. But it stands out with a desire to make a statement and create an atmosphere. That's to be commended in this homogenized world of today.This place has the makings of a great place to meet and hang out. It's got local hangout written all over it and a warm sense of familiar while also var"
Food & service are excellent. ��It was like being in Miami without the air fare!! ��I highly recommend the steak sandwhich!
"I love Yolk. Love it. It only gets three stars because of location and the service due to the location.This location just isn't my favorite. Since this location is on Michigan Ave., it attracts more tourists than I would like to encounter during my breakfast/brunch hour. and because its so packed and busy, the servers look a bit frazzled trying to get everything out and done right. Be patient when you venture to this locale.If you go to this location, be prepared to wait for a table, especially if you have a large party. I was with a group of seven people and we waited about 45 minutes to an hour.By the time we were seated I was starving, which was good, because the food is dabombdotcom.Portions are large, I would suggest sharing except they charge you two extra bucks to share. Might as we"
My husband saw thier review on Diners Drive-ins and Dives and we went there Wednesday 8/1/12 for dinner. He wanted the Beef Brisket which on the show looked awesum. ��Your photos on the web site and what we saw on the show are nothing what we were served. ��The Mussels were average but a nice size serving. The Fries were good. The Brisket was dry and tough I ordered the only Steak on the Menu which was a Ribye and it was severed on a bed of fries. The Ribye was not cooked the way I wanted and was so greasey and fatty I had a hard time cutting it and had to keep wiping my knife and fork with the napkin to get the grease off. ��Would not go back.
"As a member of the James Beard Society; a self proclaimed gourmand; having eaten at 3 star Michelin and 4 star US restaurants, this was truly the most innovative dining I have ever experienced. ��Of the 13 courses there were maybe 2 that did not knock me off my seat. ��And one was the plainest: ��a piece of somewhat chewy lamb with potatoes. ��The other was a duck confit in a mole sauce. ��Fair. ��But the presentation will remain with you for life: ��they served this course on a pillow of air that released its essence when the plate was carefully placed on the pillow. ��Smoke essence engulfed the nose and palette. ��The duck was good but not great.Overall I'd give this restaurant a 99 and truly rate it as the finest dining experience of my 65 years. ��Liquid balls of butter or grape juice that would"
"Thumbs up for their deep dish pizzas, thumbs down for their salad. They deep dish pizzas are very filling, VERY! I couldn't not finish my slice. Their Italian beef is also delish, but make you tell them to dip the beef into the meat sauce or else its really dry on the bun. I had the ""supreme salad"" and it was basically pizza toppings with lettuce. On the menu it sounded pretty tasty and healthy, but the combination was terrible. Its a good spot to eat when you are starving and the pricing is very affordable."
"I came here for lunch because I work in the area after seeing it on Yelp. Tried the Chicken and Dumplings. The dish was broth based versus the traditionally creamy dish I'm accustomed to. It was pretty decent. A little heavy on the pepper in my opinion. The portion was ""just enough"" but overvalued for the $13/14 I paid for the dish. The corn bread muffins were delish. I was raised in a house with a chef from the south so I know what corn bread is supposed to taste like. This def wasn't it but was pretty tasty nevertheless. I was kind of surprised I was expected to pay $3 for for the additional muffins I requested after I finished the 2 that my server brought out for free but whatever. I was disappointed that the fried chicken took 20 minutes else I would have gotten that so I could try mor"
"It looks like it would totally be nothing special from the outside...but the food inside is absolutley the best!The Plantians are awesome, the beans and rice...amazing...and they have this Oatmeal Shake that I have actually DREAMT about.For real.It's cash only, but also BYOB....Staff is friendly, and it seems family-based"
"I highly recommend people bringing out-of-town visitors! My brother-in-law begs me to go here every time he's in town from CA. It's a pretty cool experience if you remember to skip breakfast. Long lines on weekends, but if you're with friends catching up and not in a hurry it doesn't really matter. I've waited 40 minutes on a Saturday even after it just rained and hailed. Yes, hailed. For shorter lines and less than 15 minute waits, get there right at noon or earlier on a weekday. The Foie Gras dog is almost too much for me, but the free soda refills are always there to help me cut the creaminess if necessary. Try them all! If you're going for the 1st time and aren't sure what to get, ASK Doug! He's at the counter and takes orders and is an extremely personable guy. Servers are very nice. "
"As a new resident of Chicago from Los Angeles, I was on a mission to find legit Vietnamese food. I was out sick from work and desperately needed Pho delivery ASAP. I stumbled upon Simply It's menu and promptly ordered Pho Bo (beef pho), Goi Coun (Shrimp Springrolls), and an Avocado smoothie (for those of you who thinks that's gross, don't knock it til you try it). Half an hour later, not only did ��my pho arrive neatly packaged and piping hot, but the owner actually threw in extra veggies AND upgraded my smoothie to a LARGE AND gave me a mango salad for FREE! The delivery person said he knew I was sick and wanted me to feel better. WTH??! Who does that?! I was completely blown away as to how nice he was and called back to say thank you.Now...the PHO. It was exactly what I needed. Tasted del"
"I love this place. It's comfortable for everyone (have been with friends, a coworker, and my mom) and it's always been fine! The food is good, the beers are interesting even if you're not a beer person (I am not.)I suggest giving it a shot!"
"My reservation and everyone else's was not available until at least 45 minutes after the reservation was made! The ""Rockit Staff"" sat their regulars who had no reservations immediately.... So ridiculous! When we finally did sit down the entrees came to our group 10 minutes (at least) after each other. I think they need to do A LOT of work as there are many other (better) restaurants in the city with the same vibe. I likely will not be back for a VERY long time. GOOD LUCK IF YOU GO THERE!!!!!"
"Came here for the Poetry Slam! What a Shame! They were doing a Roast for someone that did not end until 9:30pm which only left 30 minutes for the poetry. ��The Poetry slam was to last from 7-10pm. ��The poetry slam was great, just wish it would of lasted longer. ��I may return, not sure."
"Delicious burgers, nice selection of brews. Bacon fat popcorn is a must."
"This menu was full of options for everyone. These are all extremely righteous burgers, for my own reasons I love the turkey. The key link to all of these burgers is the amazing consistency to the quality. There are never dud-burgers here. Top notch every time. I only have one question, Banana?"
"While on a business trip to Chicago we found this place in the booklet at the Hotel. This was a fabulous place, the brazilian salad bar was very fresh and had everything you could think of. ��The bacon chicken was excellent, the steak, ��on and on, they just keep coming to the table. ��That was some good food! Way better than the place in San Fran, the meat was tasty at both, but the salad bar was really excellent at this place.The DRINKS! OhMyGawd! GOOD!"
"Great breakfast spot. I wish they'd stay open later though... I'm one of those people who don't mind breakfast in the afternoon-- breakfast for dinner. It's always busy and the food is pretty good. It's not spicy or anything-- they seem to be going for a natural flavor. (I'm not really sure that I'd go any other way with eggs, per-say...) The atmosphere... it's CROWDED. In the summer, the line wraps around outside and you have to push your way through to get your name on the list. I have no intentions of doing this in the winter. I feel bad having people meet me at this location because parking is hard to come by and expensive if they park in the building garage."
"This is the BEST thin crust pizza in all of Chicago. ��My girlfriend and I saw it on Check Please and we thought we would give it a whirl. ��The service was fantastic and the pizza was so good! ��We also ordered the goat cheese appetizer. ��MMMMmmm...everything is so tasty. ��We were instantly addicted and have ordered pizza for delivery more than I would like to admit. �� If you are looking for a great thin pizza in a city famous for deep dish, look no further!"
"I am very disappointed at what I've seen from this restaurant. ��As I filled my plate from their salad bar, I noticed that most of the products at the salad bar are canned and not fresh. And since when were salads weighed to get the price??? The price of food should be based on quality, not on how heavy it is. I asked for some tahina sauce and they said it only comes on the Jerusalem salad. Another disappointment was the meat. It was dull and tasteless and I hope in the future the food will taste better. Try to change the quality of your food and try to smile for once as you accept your customers. I'm sure your not going to see me again. Hope to see some good changes."
"cardboard comparable to little ceasar's. -both thin and stuffed pie. ��Slow service-ignored us. ��I am a New yorker who worked in italian joints for years, and also even at an UNO's, which is better. this place had good fresh toppings, but the dry crust was OLD OLD OLD. what a waste of time and tummy space, next time, GINO""S EAST!"
"Huge line on a Saturday Night. ��I'd heard a lot about it. ��Very, very friendly service, very knowledgeable staff. I must say though the pizza was a little overrated. ��I expected crispy crust, not floppy. ��And, a little more flavor. ��It was just so-so. ��But the mozzarella salad and the antipasto plate were really good."
"I have never had a bad meal at Indie before. ��I've eaten there about, oh, I don't know, 90 times because I went to school at Loyola Chicago, and it's just down the street. ��Now every time I go there,1) I try something new, and 2) I bring someone new.Recently I had a sushi-off with a friend from Lincoln Park; she brought Toro, I brought Indie, and we mututally decided that Indie is the better choice. ��For those of you who don't know Toro, it's the decent sushi place in Lincoln Park that has lines out the door every night of the week.So for sushi that's better than Toro without the riduclous wait time, go up to Edgewater and have some Indie Cafe. ��I recommend the Dragon and the New York Maki. ��Oh, and their mochi is excellent, too."
"Go on Tuesday and Thursdays for 1/2 price margaritas. ��The banana margarita is to DIE for... literally tastes like you're drinking a smoothie :)The queso fundito is amazing, they put jalapenos on top so its a little spicy. Just steps from the Diversey Purple/Brown stop. ��A must try if you live in the area."
"My family and I traveled all the way from the suburbs to try this hot spot for Sunday lunch. ��5 of the dishes my family ordered were out, at noon! ��Then the dessert we wanted was out. ��The manager was gracious and sent desserts but we will not make the trip again."
"I just ate here today. If you are someone that eats Sushi a lot I would be surprised if you like this place. I am amazed at all these 5 star reviews. I had three different rolls and they were all terrible. Tasteless, mushy, just plain bad. It isn't cheap like some people are claiming. It's the same as any other sushi place in general but the rolls are much, much worse. The crab rangoon however was awesome so it isn't all bad. Just dont go there for sushi."
"One of the best Sushi options in Chicago. ��The fish is always fresh and the sashimi plate offers generous cuts of a nice variety of seafood. ��Spicy Creamy roll is the perfect combination, Spider roll is also excellent. ��The place is usually packed and definitely attracts the byob crowds. ��Table service can be dicey, the server turnover appears to be pretty high, I would recommend setting up shop at the Sushi Bar."
"What is this? It is most certainly NOT a sushi bar! It is a nightclub wannabe that happens to serve sushi... It is all about the look : not the food... it is so dark you can't read the menu or appreciate what was undoubtedly the beautiful presentation of the caterpillar roll which by the way was absolutely delicious!The edamame were undercooked. The tempura was extremely greasy. The spicy tuna roll (much spicier than normal) and the caterpillar roll were very good. Sushi presentation was beautiful from what i could make out. I like to see what i eat. Service was okay (i think they got the memo on ��refilling water, in our case they refilled our water glasses 4 times!). If owner is concerned about lighting the tables without changing the atmosphere he created ( i assume he likes it) i sugges"
"The service was poor! ?Got there, sat around for a very long time to get complimentary water. ?While we waited, other customers came in and was served immediately. ?It's impossible to miss us because we came in a group. ?And of course you know it, the waiters take their orders first while we were still waiting for water! ?It's funny though... because all the waiters kept walking pass us, looking at us, but didn't even bother to come serve us water. ?Finally, fed up and tired of their poor service, we almost walked out until a friend flagged for a server and then someone finally came over. ?Not just that, but we also waited a long period opf time for our food! ?Never ever going there again!"
"such a tourist spot i know...but i can't help it, im SUCH a fan!!!!never had a bad meal here..."
I thought that the food was awesome and the staff was great. ��Will go back!
"Good spicy Chinese food. I would recommend the Lamb with Cumin, Ma Po Tofu and Chicken with 3 chili (although the last visit they gave us the Special Dry Chili Chicken instead that was still pretty good)."
"I always feel full and I always feel like I just had an experience. Great place. The waitresses work like crazy, running around to get you stuff."
Try it and you will like it! �� Cheer!
"(To be clear, this review is about the service PRIOR to eating at the restaurant. ��This is NOT a review of the culinary experience).So, my partner and I had planned a trip to Chicago for our 10 year anniversary, and Alinea was suggested by several of our Chicago friends. ��I called American Express Platinum Service Concierge to make reservations about 10 weeks prior to our trip. ��We were informed by AMEX that they no longer shared a relationship with this restaurant and that we were to call the restaurant to understand how to make reservations. ��What?I went to the website, and was a bit confused. ��One had to buy tickets. ��But, there were no tickets to purchase, and the site offered no information as to when new tickets would become available. ��I decided to call the restaurant to see if they"
BEST place in Chicago for drinks.
"Wow...what a wonderful experience! We had a two-for-one coupon and were looking forward to the dining experience. ��(Unfortunately, the lobster had been taken off the menu due to the oil spill in the Gulf.) We were not disappointed! The meat and the 60 item salad bar were better than I remembered. We met many of the wonderful staff including but not limited to, the GM, Dimitri Poulos. We had another set of servers that was always there at just the right time. So a special thanks to Vincent, Hugo, Ozzy, and especially Nicolas! You all made our visit a great memory.Will definitely bring back friends during out next visit..."
"Word to the wise: ��Don't go unless you have a reservation, and they don't seem to like families as well as they like adults. ��At 4:15 PM on a Saturday we were asked if we had a reservation despite multiple open tables. ��They did seat us, but were begrudging not welcoming. ��Some of the empty tables stayed empty the entire time we were there, and we even had dessert. ��At about 4:30 we watched them turn away a family with two children who also had the nerve to arrive without a reservation ��(despite the continued empty tables), ��yet a few minutes later somehow manage to seat four adults who arrived without a reservation. �� The food is good, and if you like seafood then there is a really wonderful selection."
"Hopleaf is ALWAYS crowded... and for a reason. Correction: Sometimes it's easy to get a table in the dining room, but the bar is ALWAYS crowded. The beer list is extensive, and the food is great.Everyone talks about the mussels - and with good reason. They always have 2 styles on the mussels. On my last visit, one of them was Spicy Thai Curry (sweet potato, jalepeno, cilantro & lime). Our waitress recommended those, and we loved 'em. They come with a mountain of frites... we loved them. Also... the CB&J (cashew butter & fig jam, with raclette cheese on grilled sourdough) has to be tasted to be believed. Served with their mac n cheese, these two dishes were enough to satisfy two hungry people (along with a couple choices off the beer list)."
THE BEST!!Casual dress with fantastic fish fare. My favorite is the pretzel walleye. ��The spirit of Glenn's reassures me that there is life in this age of mass commercialism.
"I lived in Vietnam for a couple of years and I loved the food, now I take advantage of every opportunity to eat vietnamese food. ��I have visited many vietnamese restaurants here in the US and Simply It is by far the best and most authentic. ��Also, the service is super friendly. ��You HAAAAAVE!!!! to try it."
"I am ��happy we chose this place to have Sushi! ��Love the neighborhood, so clean and such nice people. This is a BYOB, so that was exciting and new to us! We had a few specials and the sashimi platter, then took everyone's advice and ordered the White Dragon Roll, it was AMAZING!!! ��The Rainbow Roll was very good as well! Its a tad dark in here but well worth the squinting :)"
"Recently my best friend came to visit and I was very excited to bring her here. Unfortunately our experience was not what we had anticipated. We had a pretty large party however it was on a weekday and the place was half empty. We had 3 kids w/us and a month old, which was evident by the look on the hostess face that kids weren't quite welcome. We insisted that we didn't mind if we sat in two different tables in order to make it easier on them (it was 8 of us total). She told us to wait outside while they put our tables together. Mind you, I understand this is normal for them to ask but it made no sense since they had no customers waiting in line and the entire front section was empty. We wouldn't have mind had it been above 50 degrees, if we didn't have a baby and had she not had that loo"
Good Food
Love their food! ��Service needed a little of work but enjoyed it anyway.
"We have been regulars for years and have put up with the high prices because the quality was so good and so there was perceived value for money. ��The cocktails are good, not extraordinary, but good and the food overall is very good, also not extraordinary, but a nice organic option.That was until we pretty much got fleeced in my option on the fish and chips ""special"" on a Friday night. ��I heard they had this and was dying to try it. I love a good fish and chips dish and for $19, which is very high priced for this type of entree, I expected either an interestingly reinvented fish and chips or at least a healthy amount of amazing wild caught fish. ��Well, the fish was pretty tasty, above average, but there were two very tiny pieces and the rest of the plate was loaded up with fries. Way, way "
"I wasn't sure if I should believe all of the hype about Piccolo Sogno, but my experience on Friday night made me a believer. After a year of reading about the acclaimed patio, I couldn't imagine that I'd truly be stepping into paradise, but this urban oasis really made me feel like I was in an Italian garden. Our server, Jeff, was knowledgable, honest, and entertaining. He dubbed himself our tour guide for the evening and took us on a wonderful adventure of Italian cuisine. Each dish we tried was more delicious than the last. I loved that each pasta dish could be ordered in appetizer-sized portions, which allowed our group to sample more of the menu. Don't skip the Ravioli Piccolo Sogno. The appetizer-sized portion is four pieces of Ravioli, so you can definitely enjoy it and still have ro"
Lives up to the hype as the best taco in Chicago.
AMazing choices of food for people with allergies etc. Very good coffee and ambiance.
"Honestly, I cant remember exactly what I ordered when I came here for lunch a few months ago. ��Maybe BBQ pork sandwich? ��But it came with a bunch of fried stuff and it was all really tasty. ��I'd definitely go again."
I've been a huge Sultan Market falafel fan for 10+ years!
For a place this pricey I would expect great service. The workers here feel like they are better than everyone.... at least that was my experience. If I'm paying then you shouldn't act all snobby. The second time I went it was for a friends celebration... not by choice and I was hoping I would have a better experience.... nope! The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because they have an awesome mezcal margarita and the food is actually pretty good.
"I am a fan of Fox and Obel! �� ��I still haven't found that one grocery store for all my shopping, but Fox & Obel does many things very well. ��In fact, they do thing good enough where I'll drive up to Chicago once a month or so to shop there...and I'm coming from Joliet! �� ��What do I drive there for? ��The produce? ��no, not really. ��But I do drive there for their cured meats. ��Yes, I'm addicted to Iberico Bellota jamon. ��It is soooooo good. �� �� While I'm there getting my Iberico fix I also check out the cured meats, butchered items, chocolate (Valrhona's my favorite), the cheese and the bread. �� I don't want to turn this into a jamon (salumi) review. ��But some notable cured meats to try when you're at Fox & Obel are... �� ��Iberico, Iberico Bellota, Pio Tosini, Petit Jesu, La Quercia and the ot"
"Was just in Chicago on business and pleasure. ��My cuz drove up from Indy on Friday so we could spend time together in the big city and have a little girl time. ��We had no plan - just wanted a great meal, great wine, a great experience for a great price. ��The Purple Pig offered all that. ��When we arrived, the host staff told us they were on a two hour wait, but let us know that the bar was first come first serve. ��We staked out a place to wait and the hostess (with the long blond hair) alerted us when she noticed a couple was leaving. ��That's way more that most hosts would do - especially considering how busy they were! ��We swopped in, grabbed the two bar stools and spent the next four hours being wined and dined by one of the most charming servers ever - Ryan. ��Basically, he ordered our me"
"LOVE the food, but what's with the Guac issues!!!??? We can never get it at dinner without causing some sort of mini scene (I mean, it's avacado's and you know you have them). Now today they are out of Guac! What kind of Cuban Mexican restaurant runs out of Guac!?!?!"
"I last went here a few years ago, I've known and watched a lot of music here and musicians and teachers I know personally perform here.I'm never going back.And I sincerely believe you are naive if you like this place. ��Sorry, I don't mean to insult those that enjoy the Green Mill, but this is NOT a jazz club anymore, its pure idiocy.DO NOT TELL ME TO BE SILENT IN A BAR! ��I come to a fucking BAR to have a drink, speak normally to the people I am with, and listen to music. ��IF YOU WANT SILENCE THEN MAKE IT A CONCERT HALL AND NOT A FUCKING BAR. ��I used to be able to speak at this place, even during the Vandermark-type avant-garde music - then some scenster dumbfucks must've taken the place over or something.Idiots. ��Pure idiocy. ��Music isn't meant to be listened to in silence, ESPECIALLY in a"
"I read the reviews before going here and although some were not good I wanted to try it. ��I should have listened to those reviews! ��My husband ordered a pork dish and had to send it back. ��It was all fat and the part that wasn't was extremely hard to chew. He then got the cod dish which was only ok. ��I ordered pasta with plain red sauce since I don't eat meat. ��The undercooked pasta was drenched in sauce and reminded me of chef-boy-r-dee from when I was a kid, just a sloppy meal. ��We eat dinner out about 6 nights a week and this was just a HUGE disappointment. ��The restaurant is nice inside and we enjoyed it when was Thyme a few years ago. ��We won't go back."
"Love it!! the choices are amazing! and to be able to go to a restaurant and order anything on the menu is amazing! The people are nice, and the food is great! Such a wide variety of meatless food you can order that is good!! would definitely recommend this to any vegan, vegetarian, or just person who wants to try something different!"
I went here twice but the last time they were out of Lechon. That's the only reason I drove from the suburbs out to Chicago. Would have been 4 stars otherwise.
"When it comes to encased meats this is the place. ��Although I won't say they have my favorite Chicago style Dog, Doug never disappoints. ��Be ready for a bit of a wait since this isn't exactly a hidden gem. �� If its your first time use the time in line wisely and chat with those around you... its Chicago we're friendly and most likely those standing around you are regulars. Hot Doug's namesake is always behind the counter feel free to ask him for recommendations and definitely don't leave without getting at least one of the specialty dogs."
Great food and pleasant staff. I had a really nice experience here. The food was tasty and the service was nice too! To start off with I recommend the Tzatziki as your cold appetizer and the Flaming Saganaki Cheese as your hot one. Both were excellent! I will be going back.
"Very average vietnamese food. Fresh spring rolls are dry, too big and contain too many things in it. How are you suppose to put this big roll in your mouth?Pho Ga (chicken soup) is very different from the real one that has simmered for hours in a pot. Service is very average and the restaurant start to look like a mess at the entrance."
"Wow... can't believe how many reviews Wakamono has already! It makes sense though- this place is always packed whenever I walk past.I finally stopped in here the other night with a friend to see what all the fuss was about. Well, there's a reason for the fuss. This place is great! Talking about the atmosphere sounds kind of lame, but the design really is calming and beautiful. Even if you sit outside, you still get a really calming experience.Ok, so to the good part- the food! We ordered the crab rangoon (has a slightly different name- but that's what it is) and it was delicious. The edges were crispy but the center was moist and yummy.We aren't big sushi people, so we played it a bit safe with our selection. We ordered a regular tuna and avocado maki (my fav), the sweet potato maki, and a"
"Well, this place has really gone down since I last visited in 2010. ��The salad bar just ok. Nothing like their competition. They brought over a tiny plate of mashed potatoes, sorry looking fried bananas, creamed spinach with only cream (no spinach), and dried out rice. Once we labored through that, we turned over our chips to indicate we wanted meat service, and waited and waited and waited. And it wasnt busy. A Monday night ! ��Overall, meat was good but again, but not like the other places. I just got the impression they are cutting corners a bit.We had a 2 for 1 coupon. The waiter initially told us it would be two dinners for $34.99 which seemed too good to be true. When the check came, it was $48.50 for two. It didn't irk me that much because I expected to pay $48.50 for two in the firs"
A couple years back I would have given this place 5 stars. ��They've since raised prices and dropped my favorite item from the menu (cuban steak sandwich). ��But the jalapeno & honey butter they bring out with the complimentary bread...I could eat for hours.
"Went to Schwa for a birthday dinner. I had no problems getting a reservation -- two DAYs before we ate. It can be done, you just have to flexible. I left a message on their voice mail saying I'd like a reservation for any day that week should they have a cancellation. They called back a day later with two different days for me to choose. Logically it makes sense, most people make these reservations so far in advance, when the time comes they can't make it.The food is fantastic. It's great to watch the kitchen in action. BYOB really helps on the price."
"The bartenders are very rude. ��The place itself very nice and the food looks great, but I wouldn't go back. The bartenders were rolling their eyes at customers and giving an attitude when the bar wasn't even busy or crowded. They made you feel like you were wasting their time."
"The thin crust pizza was so-so, but I'd go back to try another and give it a second chance. The beer from this brew-pub was good, and I love the fact they don't distribute, which increased my rating to a 4 star.Seating was very nice (we sat down at the garden level). It was lunchtime on a Friday and there was plenty of room for our large group."
Warning: ��The Wings are INSANE! ��They will inspire midnight cravings. ��4 Stars because their 'sides' need some work.
"Went to Mercat last night, and any of the early reviews with criticism of staff, their silly headsets, and any other nonsense must be ignored. ��They have smoothed out the kinks, and there was only one earpiece in evidence, on what I assume was their rail-thin manager.As background, I was in Barcelona with my wife and parents last summer, and we found some amazing places to spend our devalued currency. ��From the classic Taller de Tapas to a new, fusion joint, Bar Lobo, we tried everything. ��As a side note, I would not be surprised if the decor in Mercat was inspired by Bar Lobo -- my wife and I both noted some great similarities.That's just the tip of the iceberg. ��We were four, the magical number where tapas is no longer a wasted effort, and you get to try a wider variety. ��And what variet"
"This was our first experience with Ethiopian food, and we are now big fans of it thanks to Demera! ��The service started out kinda iffy when the host told us there were no high chairs available even though we called ahead to reserve some. ��And, it took a while for a server to bring us menus and take our orders.However, things quickly improved. ��Food came out fast, everyone was SUPER nice, and overall we had a great time. ��No one seemed to mind that our table for 8 included 4 kids, and the host went out of his way to keep the toddlers entertained and happy.The food was awesome. ��I know I will be craving it again soon. ��We'll be back!!"
"like the review says just ok, maybe better on weekend night"
"Cute. ��It's classy and defiantly attracts a higher-end crowd which is fun. ��Drinks take a while to come and service is usually slower but extremely knowledgeable! ��I ask to be surprised with something made with Tequila and am never disappointed with a drink that has over 7 ingredients in it. ��Bartenders know their trade and the atmosphere is whimsical and refreshing. ��Also like the list of rules as it keeps all the annoying people off their cell phones, drunks to find a different bar, and trashy people to stay at bay. ��Dress nice and have a drink in mind other than a light beer or shot."
"If, like me, you like to eat and drink a variety of foods when you are hungover in an attempt to make yourself feel like a human being again, the salad bar at Sultan's Market is ��a god send. ��It has been emprically proven that at any given moment during their hours of operation, 20 somethings in various states of drug/alcohol influence and/or withdrawal will be seeking sweet, cheap sustenance at the Wicker Park location. ��Of course, I could be projecting...Bottom line is I moved out of the neighborhood a year ago and still drive down there from Lincoln Square when I need my Sultan's fix!"
"having grown up with a lot of great veggie options, I expect great veggie food. I heard great things about Chicago Diner, and was looking forward to the experience. the food is good, but not great. service can be slow at times, and its not a place to go if you are in a rush. but overall good veggie meal and great vegan shakes"
"Sunda is the spot I ALWAYS take friends for a special occasion, the ""IT"" spot when I have out-of-town guests, or when I just want an AMAZING meal!The Restaurant Partner & Manager; Aeron, is always there to greet me and find out how my experience is going or/ was! ��He is extremely thoughtful, and ensures that every dining experience is an amazing one! ��The concept of this Asian Fusion Restaurant is to indulge in as many types of cuisines from Korean to Filipino, while dabbling in a variety of share plates. ��My suggestion would be to try at least one or two types from every category on menu; in order to obtain a true experience of these delightful dishes!The service is consistently ""on-point,"" and I have never once been disappointed by my meal. ��I also love to indulge in the extensive 'Speci"
"Such great food, huge vegan selection. Just went there yesterday for the first time! They're awesome, they make a mean spicy falafel sandwich!! Their prices are super low also! 5 bucks for a huge falafel and soda. Cannot go wrong here!"
"I went there with some friends one night. ?I'm not sure why intelligent people would spend hard earned money to be treated like 6 year olds.Here are some of the things I learned were NOT allowed:- NO standing - You will be shown to your seat by a Violet Robot. ?You are not allowed to move from your seating area. ?I don't think you need to ask permission to use the washroom (I didn't have to go, but would have raised my hand if I needed to), but you are not allowed to move about your area. ?Yes, you are in a group timeout.- NO Cell Phones - Now, I think this is actually a good rule. ?Sitting around people constantly yammering into their phones is no good, but there are times when a quick text comes in handy. ?Trying to coordinate a large group sometimes calls for improv, but no, don't think"
"Visited Shaw's on our first night in Chicago, for the New Year holiday... ��the staff was friendly and cordial, and atmosphere unique. ��We were easily accommodated, for a later dinner (without reservations), and chose to sit on the oyster bar side--a cool venue, with a near identical menu as the traditional restaurant seating side (on the left). ��I ordered a cup of clam chowder soup--which was DELISH, and thoroughly enjoyed the Cesar salad with crab cake entree--comprising a generous and tasty portion of both. ��We will definitely return to Shaw's on future trips to Chicago!"
Awesome breakfast & Lunch a must try. Very busy though so go not so hungry if you have to wait or go on a weekday. The pancakes are awesome and tasty. The lunch sandwiches are savory too
"My dad loves this place, so when he's in town, this is pretty much a must-go. ��Their food is good, portions are usually enormous, and while the salad bar is expensive, it's probably one of the best in that type of dining establishment (meaning, not super high end). ��It's usually packed on the weekend, so beware and plan ahead!"
"I first had their mango mousse cake from a friend and I just had to have it for my birthday. It's simply amazing. It's unlike anything I've ever had and I'm defiantly coming back for it. However, I didn't give it a 5 star rating because I was told that I would have a white chocolate plaque on the cake; that didn't happen. And the bottom of the cake was thoroughly soaked through with syrup. Disappointing, but still good."
"My husband wanted to go to the new (well, newer) Mastro's here in Chicago for his birthday since he's a huge fan of their location in Scottsdale. ��We arrived a few minutes early, and were politely asked by the hostess to wait in the bar until our table was ready. ��The place was packed and it seemed no one was in a hurry to finish their meals. ��No big deal - but after a 40 minute wait, we were just a little annoyed - not to mention hungry. ��Luckily, we had an awesome server to make it all right. ��Emily came over as soon as we were seated to tend to our drink orders, find out how familiar we were with the menu, get our take on the appetizers, and then insist on bringing us not one, but two, on the house. ��We had the ahi tuna and the crab and both were fantastic. ��I would have been happy with"
We experienced the most unprofessional customer service ever. The hostesses and even the manager were very rude and unprofessional. I will not eat there even if it was a free meal. Texas de Brazil downtown Chicago was much better in every way and they will have our business again and again.
"This place was recommended to me from a colleague, who rants and rave about this place. Telling her that I've yet to find a place that was equivalent to the Cuban cooking in Miami, she recommended this place. ��I was looking forward to going to this spot, only to be disappointed. If you are looking for a fusion of Cuban and Mexican cooking come to this place, but for authentic Cuban I suggest going elsewhere. I started off with a carife of Sangria which was watered down, and tasted more like the cheapest table wine and fruits that were thrown to call it Sangria. (Yes, I know that sangria is basically that, but trust me ��I know the difference). The spinach quesadillas were quite tasty(one of the reasons why i gave this place 2 stars, instead of 1), The main entree I had was the Cuban style c"
was in Chicago last week. We wanted Chicago pizza and boy was this delicious. had it delivered to our hotel after a concert. best pizza in the world! Will definitely order from them again when I am in Chicago. We had a deep crust pepperoni.
"Food: Okay (a few winners on the menu, a lot of losers)Service: GoodAtmosphere: Horrible (crowded, small, and in need of a bigger space). Price: Fair Overall: great for a few specialty dishes if you don't mind eating arm to arm with fifty people packed in a small space first thing in the morning."
"great flavors, fresh salad bar!will absolutely go back!"
Absolutely love the food at this place. ��I'm so tired of being limited to a handful of pasta dishes at Italian restaurants. ��This place is refreshingly unique with lots of different options. ��It's a really fun place to go with a large group as the plates are designed to share. ��Wine selection is also wonderful. ��Only negative is the fact that they don't take reservations. ��Really do not like that part.
"I just moved to Andersonville and I love this place. ��The service is great and they have a good menu of imported beers, mostly Belgian. ��As for the food, my favorites are the mussels, beef brisket sandwich and rabbit stew. ��This is a good place to hang out in groups too as the atmosphere is noisy."
"They have all kinds of hot dogs or sausages in buns, that you can try and enjoy. It is much better than the Supergawg place on millwaukee and devon. Recently they have been on TV. Good place.,"
"We went there on a recent visit to Chicago because we received a coupon from our hotel. The Spinach Artichoke dip was great! My sister and I split the turkey burger, which was also very good. The service was very attentive. Highly recommended."
"This place is great their steak tacos are out of this world. ��They serve them a la pastor style so you only get onions, cilantro, and cheese for topping but who needs anything else with flavor like this.Open Late too."
This stuff is fire.Late to jump on the wagon...Making up for it.
duck duck duck- this is the place- I dream about it when it has been a while since we have been there- other faves- walnut shrimp (use the hot sauce to give it a kick) and beef chow fun with pan fried rice noodles- service is always attentive but not intrusive and this is a fabulous place for big groups as they have round tables that can seat ten-
"Customer service sucks!!! Takes forever to get your food. None of the waiters speak English. However, the food is descent. When the owner is not working all the managers are lost. On the days the owner is working, you will have better service."
I am so picky when I eat Chinese food and finding good Chinese seems to be so hard in this city....but this place has great BBQ chicken and duck. ��The scallion and ginger dipping sauce is fantastic and really send the slow roast meat over the top. ��You come here for the food only.....the decor is classically cheesy and laden with formica ��and ��fluorescent lighting...but its the food that counts in terms of what you would come here for. ��I had a group of chefs that I led on a tour of the city who wanted to experience BBQ in Chicago ad I took them here and they loved it....and they were from Texas which adds some credibility.
"Get the Soltani, It's awesome."
"Bridgeport has needed a spot like this for years. ��Great, organic, food with a latin theme. ��Good coffee, excellent loose leaf tea, friendly servers and above all else, delicious food. ��It's a bit small, which means there is a wait, but the wait is worth it.Coffee: A bit on the weak side for my taste (my taste being Turkish coffee), but well flavored and not old.Tea: A very tasty, loose leaf black.Nanadict: A great take on eggs benedict. ��Tha papusas are an excellent substitute for english muffins and the home fries were some of the best I've ever had.Stuffed French Toast: Delicious, marscarpone and agave nectar stuffed french toast. ��Beautifully fork tender."
"Probably the BEST Mexican restaurant in Chicago, hands down. Well at least the best Mexican restaurant on the north side. I'm only sad they're closed while they're remodeling. EXCELLENT Mexican food, they're fajitas are awesome and really filling, so filling I had to take the rest home in a doggy bag. Some other things that are pretty tasty are they're huge tacos and burritos and they're wicked enchiladas. They make a mean drink too, especially there margaritas. So if you're in Lincoln Square and not wanting to eat at the many bougie restaurants that line Lincoln Avenue, head to Garcia's and get your Mexican grub on"
"I came here before summer for my brithday dinner but this is the first time I came back to this pretty restaurant because I kinda busy for my senior year at DePaul and I heard that they got the great lunch special. And it's absolutely right. I got a beef banh mi and it's so so good. I used to eat Vietnamese banh mi in uptown but this one is so much better and the price is unbelievable. I just had to pay $6.95 for my lunch special which included sandwich banh mi, salad, soup, egg roll, drink and deserts. I was surprise because everyday I have to pay more than $7 for the Big Mac meal which is not fresh and healthy at all. I'm so glad because from now,I don't have to worry about my lunch anymore because I got a great restaurant with the best food and wonderful service next to my campus. LOVE "
"Indie cafe has proved to serve the best sushi and Thai food consistently for the past three years I have lived in Chicago. ��Though I have tried to expand my knowledge of Thai/sushi restaurants time and again, I keep coming back to Indie because nothing beats it! ��Their dine-in experience is top notch, offering a classy and upbeat atmosphere with great service, and their delivery is unsurpassed--delivering hot food and fresh sushi in a timely manner. ��I highly recommend!As for the lone one-star review below: There is no way a shard of glass was in a sushi roll, seeing as everything is hand rolled and would CUT the person rolling it. ��Also, it is packed immediately behind the sushi bar. ��Nice try on the free meals though! ��Furthermore, if I claimed to have glass in my food at a restaurant th"
"Savory salads? I think not. The menu description was misleading and disappointing, to say the least. I made the outstanding choice to order the Caesar Caesar. The fresh parmesan turned out to be the powder-y kind that comes from a green can and the 'savory garlic croutons' were crumbs that came in a foil packet (I'm not exaggerating either; I had to tear from the perforation on the corner to open the packet!). The tofu that I added was the consistency of runny, undercooked eggs. After one bite, I pushed it aside. At least the super strips of chicken my six year old ordered were good."
"They added a child-free Sunday Brunch from heaven. ��It's significantly cheaper than dinner (as is appropriate) and, when we went, had a selection of unusual and tremendously yummy brunch cocktail options in addition to the traditional 'mimosa' type fare.So so so good."
Had a delicious dinner here with my boyfriend. ��We sat in the back room which faces out onto a lovely courtyard. ��The atmosphere was very romantic and the food was delicious. ��We each opted for an appetizer and entree. ��I started with the grilled calamari and shrimp which was very good. ��My boyfriend loved his burrata and prosciutio. ��I had the farro pasta with mushrooms and asparagus. ��Superb. ��My boyfriend had the pasta of the day - a delicious pasta with mushrooms and shaved truffles. ��Highly recommend for date night.
"only been for lunch or carry-out, but always very pleased. My brother and sister-in-law are total addicts!Check out my blog - http://barredowl.wordpre��_ - for a full review and pics!"
"Me and husband go here all the time. I have never had a bad experience. ��The staff is very friendly, and the food is great. ��I have yet to find a Vegetarian/Vegan restaurant that can beat this place. ��I have tried several different things, and have enjoyed them all. �� They have a great outside eating area in the back as well. ��They have parking on the side of the building which helps out a lot. ��ENJOY!"
"I really wish I could offer a good review, especially after reading past reviews. ��However, when they call you on a Saturday afternoon to essentially say they don't feel like opening up that night, they should expect some knocks. ��Schwa, be quirky all you want - don't pick up your phone and only open when you feel like it - just don't expect that I'll ever be a customer."
Great atmosphere! ��Good food but a bit overpriced. ��Drinks are pricey too. ��Great place to go for a special occasion. ��Love the ceviche.
"Best deep dish pizza in Chicago. The pizza is great, but the sandwiches and other menu items aren't great. But I guess that is to be expected at a pizza joint."
"I love this place. The value can't be beat. I've eaten in the restaurant and have also ordered their food for events off site. If you are looking for a place to order food for a party, you can't beat Sapori. I always get rave reviews and the food is fantastic even though it's made in large quantities. The homemade Rigatoni is wonderful as I have a lot of vegetarian friends. I don't know if they deliver. I always pick it up and have never asked about delivery."
Best.....Pizza.....In......Chicago.
"Great bakery, breads, cookies,and European pastries.Lunch is very good, but since I don't eat much meat, sometimes I feel my choices are a bit limited. ��I like their sandwiches, soups and salads."
One word - CREEPY!
"Maybe it was the hype. ��I had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant. ��I came here New Years Eve with some friends and had the tasting menu. ��The food was average at best. ��Nothing special that blew me away. ��The ambience was more upscale which contradicts what I think of in a tapas place. ��I'm accustomed to a more casual, loud, friendly atmosphere. ��Also, the food was pretty pricy. ��I'd rather eat at Cafe Barcelona up in Evanston any day."
"I would eat here every night if I could... and I probably could because it is so afordable! ��The new, more comtemporary, setup across the street takes away from the ambiance a bit - but the food is still amazing!"
amazing
"Would not recommend this place if you're interested in seeing or hearing the people you are with. It is too loud and dark in the place to have a conversation with others. In addition, service was extremely slow (we began to set timers to see when they would take our initial order, then when we would get check) and food was overpriced and mediocre. The only positive I can say is the busboys were attentive at clearing dishes and refilling water."
I have been here several times and although by no means do i consider myself a southern food expert I have not had a bad meal here. ��The service is some of the best I have ever had anywhere!
"The food is great, however, the service is awful! The host, which is this guy who is so rude. ?I went there when it was really cold outside and he wouldn't let people wait inside. Ok, fine, I understand that to a degree but he didn't have to treat people like herding cows. ?He yelled at me and gave me a math lesson when I asked him if table 73 was next. ?His eyes were about to bulge out and he was looking at me very intensily as he yelled 72 comes before 73! Anyway, I always left feeling like trash everyi time I go there and I've been there like 5 times. ?Not sure it's worth the abuse even though the food is good."
"This is a great restaurant. ��There are over 200 items on the menu. ��The portions are huge and I feel that you get what you pay for! ��I had the Mediterranian Mahi Mahi...it was excellent. ��I followed that with the Chocolate Chip Banana Bread Pudding...wow! ��I was extremely please with the service. ��The atmosphere is nice yet casual enough for you to sit back and enjoy yourself. ��As someone else mentioned, the floor layout is well spread out.I highly recommend this as one of your meal choices when visiting Chicago."
I had the red eggs...2 scrambled eggs on tortillas with cheese and salsa. ��It was delicious! ��They give a ton of food and I was stuffed afterwards. ��I was in a bit of a hurry that day and so the experience was rushed. ��I will go back when I am in town again and will take my time to really enjoy the experience.Bathroom report- ��ehhhhh...not a fan.
"salted roasted beets w/goat cheese = a little heavier than i would've likedoctopus with fingerlings and green beens = super good and delishscallop spiedini = seared to perfection.... def recommendopen face blt= unique and full of flavor, loved thisbraised shoulder = great concept and flavor, but a little on the salty side.pork neck bone gravy w/ricotta = tastes good, but nothing special. just seemed like a heavy tomato sauce with a kick.all in all, i liked it - it was good service, good atmosphere, unique in it's own way, and the food was overall tasty and hearty. ��I will say that it was a little bit on the heavy and saltier side... but it's kinda expected if you're going that specialized in pork! ��My only complaint was that it was a bit difficult to find from Michigan Avenue."
"great atmosphere. great service. free valet!!!went on a saturday night around 7 PM. there were A LOT of people waiting.... the food was delicious, but not as out-of-this-world as i had anticipated. we didn't have the greatest seat in the house, but it wasn't terrible... just a bit crowded. i LOVE greek food, and will definitely be back, just probably not on a saturday night."
"The atmosphere was nice for the price I paid.The food was not that impressive as this place is more like chain operated.I would recommend this place when you want to feel that franchise operated atmosphere, food and service once in a while. Not a place to go to for Chicago foodies."
"Alliance did our wedding cake in April, it turned out amazing! ��The design was great and it tasted great too!"
"I went recently and had to wait for a friend(an hour)due to my cellphone not working.The owner brought me complimentary edamame and the waitress made me feel very comfortable.I ordered the sushi platter and it was very fresh.The atmopshere is lively and colorful,food tasty and the service was attentive.So grateful to have you in hood!"
"I am absolutely in love with this restaurant. ��I don't even know what else to say... other than... AMAZING food, AMAZING atmosphere, AMAZING service... simply amazing. :)"
"I love the pizza here (I always order the bufalina, simple and tasty).I adore the buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer!!!!But darn, this place is really overpriced and it's the only reasons I didn't give it a 5 stars. I still love going there for the pizza and I typically choose not to drink any wine or take any dessert or the bill would be outrageously high.$16 for a individual pizza (bufalina) is ehm...quite expensive.Anyway, I'm happy with my compromise, quality over quantity.If you can, avoid busy hours on Friday and Saturday night..."
"Went there last Friday for dinner and everything was great! ��Sammy set us up with some wine & cheese pairing in the wine room and that was excellent. ��After that, we were escort to our table for dinner. ��Dinner was great with variety of salads, meats, and fish. ��Very good service from all the staff. ��The GM came over to make sure we were having a great dinner. ��Will definitely come back soon!"
