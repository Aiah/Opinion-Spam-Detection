REQUIREMENTS

1. install tensor flow

Implementing Convoluted Neural Networks with Tensor Flow


1.Run the train.py as follows:
python /Users/suchivedala/Desktop/Opinion_Spam_Detection/CNN_Tensorflow/train.py

2. Run the evaluation file as follows:
python //Users/suchivedala/Desktop/Opinion_Spam_Detection/CNN_Tensorflow/evaluate.py --eval_train --checkpoint_dir="/Users/suchivedala/runs/1481265171/checkpoints/" 

3. source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate

4. tensorboard --logdir= /Users/suchivedala/runs/1481265171/summaries

5. open the web server, and run localhost:6006


Comments:
1. RUnning the evaluate script after the completion of training yields better results.
